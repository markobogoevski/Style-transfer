act i scene london .
the palace .
enter king henry , lord john of lancaster , the earl of westmoreland , sir walter blunt , and others so shaken as we are , so wan with care , find we a time for frighted peace to pant , and breathe accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote .
no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own children blood , nor more shall trenching war channel her fields , nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed eyes , which , like the meteors of a troubled heaven , all of one nature , of one substance bred , did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now , in mutual ranks , march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance , kindred and allies the edge of war , like an knife , no more shall cut his master .
therefore , friends , as far as to the sepulchre of christ , whose soldier now , under whose blessed cross we are impressed and engaged to fight , forthwith a power of english shall we levy , whose arms were moulded in their mothers ' womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walk those blessed feet which fourteen hundred years ago were nail for our advantage on the bitter cross .
but this our purpose now is twelve month old , and bootless is to tell you we will go therefore we meet not now .
then let me hear of you , my gentle cousin westmoreland , what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience .
my liege , this haste was hot in question , and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight when all athwart there came a post from wales loaden with heavy news , whose worst was , that the noble mortimer , leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower , was by the rude hands of that welshman taken , a thousand of his people butchered , upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse , such beastly shameless transformation , by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of .
it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land .
this match with other did , my gracious lord , for more uneven and unwelcome news came from the north and thus it did import on day , the gallant hotspur there , young harry percy and brave archibald , that and approved scot , at holmedon met , where they did spend a sad and bloody hour , as by discharge of their artillery , and shape of likelihood , the news was told , for he that brought them , in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse , uncertain of the issue any way .
here is a dear , a true industrious friend , sir walter blunt , new lighted from his horse .
stain with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours , and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news .
the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots , two and twenty knights , balk in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedon plains .
of prisoners , hotspur took mordake the earl of fife , and eldest son to beaten douglas , and the earl of athol , of murray , angus , and menteith and is not this an honourable spoil ?
a gallant prize ?
ha , cousin , is it not ?
in faith , it is a conquest for a prince to boast of .
yea , there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son , a son who is the theme of honour tongue , amongst a grove , the very straightest plant , who is sweet fortune minion and her pride whilst i , by looking on the praise of him , see riot and dishonour stain the brow of my young harry .
o that it could be proved that some fairy had exchanged in our children where they lay , and call mine percy , his plantagenet !
then would i have his harry , and he mine .
but let him from my thoughts .
what think you , coz , of this young percy pride ?
the prisoners , which he in this adventure hath surprised , to his own use he keeps , and sends me word , i shall have none but mordake earl of fife .
this is his uncle teaching , this is worcester , malevolent to you in all aspects , which makes him prune himself , and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity .
but i have sent for him to answer this , and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem .
cousin , on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor , so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us again , for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be uttered .
i will , my liege .
exeunt scene ii .
london .
an apartment of the prince .
enter the prince of wales and falstaff now , hal , what time of day is it , lad ?
thou art so , with drinking of old sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after noon , that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know .
what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day ?
unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in taffeta , i see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day .
indeed , you come near me now , hal , for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars , and not by phoebus , he , wandering knight so fair . '
and , i prithee , sweet wag , when thou art king , as , god save thy grace , majesty i should say , for grace thou wilt have none , what , none ?
no , by my troth , not so much as will serve to prologue to an egg and butter .
well , how then ?
come , roundly , roundly .
marry , then , sweet wag , when thou art king , let not us that are squires of the night body be called thieves of the day beauty let us be diana foresters , gentlemen of the shade , minions of the moon , and let men say we be men of good government , being governed , as the sea is , by our noble and chaste mistress the moon , under whose countenance we steal .
thou sayest well , and it holds well too , for the fortune of us that are the moon men doth ebb and flow like the sea , being governed , as the sea is , by the moon .
as , for proof , now a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on monday night and most dissolutely spent on tuesday morning , got with swearing by ' and spent with crying in , ' now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows .
by the lord , thou sayest true , lad .
and is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench ?
as the honey of hybla , my old lad of the castle .
and is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance ?
how now , how now , mad wag !
what , in thy quips and thy quiddities ?
what a plague have i to do with a buff jerkin ?
why , what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern ?
well , thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft .
did i ever call for thee to pay thy part ?
no , i give thee thy due , thou hast paid all there .
yea , and elsewhere , so far as my coin would stretch , and where it would not , i have used my credit .
yea , and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent but , i prithee , sweet wag , shall there be gallows standing in england when thou art king ?
and resolution thus fobbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law ?
do not thou , when thou art king , hang a thief .
no , thou shalt .
shall i ?
o rare !
by the lord , i be a brave judge .
thou judgest false already i mean , thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman .
well , hal , well , and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court , i can tell you .
for obtaining of suits ?
yea , for obtaining of suits , whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe .
, i am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear .
or an old lion , or a lover lute .
yea , or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe .
what sayest thou to a hare , or the melancholy of ?
thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most comparative , rascalliest , sweet young prince .
but , hal , i prithee , trouble me no more with vanity .
i would to god thou and i knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought .
an old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you , sir , but i marked him not , and yet he talked very wisely , but i regarded him not , and yet he talked wisely , and in the street too .
thou didst well , for wisdom cries out in the streets , and no man regards it .
o , thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint .
thou hast done much harm upon me , hal , god forgive thee for it !
before i knew thee , hal , i knew nothing , and now am i , if a man should speak truly , little better than one of the wicked .
i must give over this life , and i will give it over by the lord , and i do not , i am a villain i be damned for never a king son in christendom .
where shall we take a purse tomorrow , jack ?
, where thou wilt , lad , i make one , an i do not , call me villain and baffle me .
i see a good amendment of life in thee , from praying to .
why , hal , is my vocation , hal , is no sin for a man to labour in his vocation .
enter poins poins !
now shall we know if gadshill have set a match .
o , if men were to be saved by merit , what hole in hell were hot enough for him ?
this is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried ' to a true man .
good morrow , ned .
good morrow , sweet hal .
what says monsieur remorse ?
what says sir john sack and sugar ?
jack !
how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul , that thou soldest him on last for a cup of madeira and a cold capon leg ?
sir john stands to his word , the devil shall have his bargain , for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs he will give the devil his due .
then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil .
else he had been damned for cozening the devil .
but , my lads , my lads , morning , by four , early at gadshill !
there are pilgrims going to canterbury with rich offerings , and traders riding to london with fat purses i have vizards for you all , you have horses for yourselves gadshill lies in rochester i have bespoke supper night in eastcheap we may do it as secure as sleep .
if you will go , i will stuff your purses full of crowns , if you will not , tarry at home and be hanged .
hear ye , yedward , if i tarry at home and go not , i hang you for going .
you will , chops ?
hal , wilt thou make one ?
who , i rob ?
i a thief ?
not i , by my faith .
there neither honesty , manhood , nor good fellowship in thee , nor thou camest not of the blood royal , if thou darest not stand for ten shillings .
well then , once in my days i be a madcap .
why , that well said .
well , come what will , i tarry at home .
by the lord , i be a traitor then , when thou art king .
i care not .
sir john , i prithee , leave the prince and me alone i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go .
well , god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting , that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believed , that the true prince may , for recreation sake , prove a false thief , for the poor abuses of the time want countenance .
farewell you shall find me in eastcheap .
farewell , thou latter spring !
farewell , summer !
exit falstaff now , my good sweet honey lord , ride with us i have a jest to execute that i can not manage alone .
falstaff , bardolph , peto and gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid yourself and i will not be there , and when they have the booty , if you and i do not rob them , cut this head off from my shoulders .
how shall we part with them in setting forth ?
why , we will set forth before or after them , and appoint them a place of meeting , wherein it is at our pleasure to fail , and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves , which they shall have no sooner achieved , but we set upon them .
yea , but is like that they will know us by our horses , by our habits and by every other appointment , to be ourselves .
tut !
our horses they shall not see i tie them in the wood , our vizards we will change after we leave them and , sirrah , i have cases of buckram for the nonce , to immask our noted outward garments .
yea , but i doubt they will be too hard for us .
well , for two of them , i know them to be as cowards as ever turned back , and for the third , if he fight longer than he sees reason , i forswear arms .
the virtue of this jest will be , the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty , at least , he fought with , what wards , what blows , what extremities he endured , and in the reproof of this lies the jest .
well , i go with thee provide us all things necessary and meet me night in eastcheap , there i sup .
farewell .
farewell , my lord .
exit poins i know you all , and will awhile uphold the unyoked humour of your idleness yet herein will i imitate the sun , who doth permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world , that , when he please again to be himself , being wanted , he may be more wonder at , by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapours that did seem to strangle him .
if all the year were playing holidays , to sport would be as tedious as to work , but when they seldom come , they wish for come , and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents .
so , when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised , by how much better than my word i am , by so much shall i falsify men hopes , and like bright metal on a sullen ground , my reformation , glittering my fault , shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off .
i so offend , to make offence a skill , redeeming time when men think least i will .
exit scene iii .
london .
the palace .
enter the king , northumberland , worcester , hotspur , sir walter blunt , with others my blood hath been too cold and temperate , unapt to stir at these indignities , and you have found me , for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself , mighty and to be fear , than my condition , which hath been smooth as oil , soft as young down , and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul pays but to the proud .
our house , my sovereign liege , little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it , and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly .
my worcester , get thee gone , for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o , sir , your presence is too bold and peremptory , and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow .
you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel , we shall send for you .
exit worcester you were about to speak .
to north yea , my good lord .
those prisoners in your highness ' name demanded , which harry percy here at holmedon took , were , as he says , not with such strength denied as is deliver to your majesty either envy , therefore , or misprison is guilty of this fault and not my son .
my liege , i did deny no prisoners .
but i remember , when the fight was done , when i was dry with rage and extreme toil , breathless and faint , leaning upon my sword , came there a certain lord , neat , and trimly dress , fresh as a bridegroom , and his chin new reap show like a at , he was perfumed like a milliner , and his finger and his thumb he held a , which ever and anon he gave his nose and away again , who therewith angry , when it next came there , took it in snuff , and still he smiled and talk , and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by , he call them untaught knaves , unmannerly , to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility .
with many holiday and lady terms he question me , amongst the rest , demanded my prisoners in your majesty behalf .
i then , all smarting with my wounds being cold , to be so pester with a popinjay , out of my grief and my impatience , answer neglectingly i know not what , he should or he should not , for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a of guns and drums and wounds , god save the mark ! and telling me the thing on earth was parmaceti for an inward bruise , and that it was great pity , so it was , this villanous should be digg out of the bowels of the harmless earth , which many a good tall fellow had destroy so cowardly , and but for these vile guns , he would himself have been a soldier .
this bald unjointed chat of his , my lord , i answer indirectly , as i said , and i beseech you , let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty .
the circumstance consider , good my lord , lord harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place , at such a time , with all the rest retold , may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said , so he unsay it now .
why , yet he doth deny his prisoners , but with proviso and exception , that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his , the foolish mortimer , who , on my soul , hath wilfully betray the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician , damn glendower , whose daughter , as we hear , the earl of march hath lately married .
shall our coffers , then , be emptied to redeem a traitor home ?
shall we but treason ?
and indent with fears , when they have lost and forfeited themselves ?
no , on the barren mountains let him starve , for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer .
revolted mortimer !
he never did fall off , my sovereign liege , but by the chance of war , to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds , those mouthed wounds , which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn sedgy bank , in single opposition , hand to hand , he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink , upon agreement , of swift severn flood , who then , affrighted with their bloody looks , ran fearfully among the trembling reeds , and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank , bloodstained with these valiant combatants .
never did base and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds , nor could the noble mortimer receive so many , and all willingly then let not him be slander with revolt .
thou dost belie him , percy , thou dost belie him , he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee , he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy .
art thou not ashamed ?
but , sirrah , henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means , or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you .
my lord northumberland , we licence your departure with your son .
send us your prisoners , or you will hear of it .
exeunt king henry , blunt , and train an if the devil come and roar for them , i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so , for i will ease my heart , albeit i make a hazard of my head .
what , drunk with choler ?
stay and pause awhile here comes your uncle .
worcester speak of mortimer !
, i will speak of him , and let my soul want mercy , if i do not join with him yea , on his part i empty all these veins , and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust , but i will lift the mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king , as this ingrate and canker bolingbroke .
brother , the king hath made your nephew mad .
who struck this heat up after i was gone ?
he will , forsooth , have all my prisoners , and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife brother , then his cheek look pale , and on my face he turn an eye of death , trembling even at the name of mortimer .
i can not blame him was not he proclaim by richard that dead is the next of blood ?
he was , i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king , whose wrongs in us god pardon ! did set forth upon his irish expedition , from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered .
and for whose death we in the world wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of .
but soft , i pray you , did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown ?
he did , myself did hear it .
nay , then i can not blame his cousin king , that wished him on the barren mountains starve .
but shall it be that you , that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation , shall it be , that you a world of curses undergo , being the agents , or base second means , the cords , the ladder , or the hangman rather ?
o , pardon me that i descend so low , to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king , shall it for shame be spoken in these days , or fill up chronicles in time to come , that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf , as both of you god pardon it ! have done , to put down richard , that sweet lovely rose , an plant this thorn , this canker , bolingbroke ?
and shall it in more shame be further spoken , that you are fool , discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent ?
no , yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banish honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again , revenge the jeering and disdain contempt of this proud king , who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore , i say peace , cousin , say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book , and to your discontents i read you matter deep and dangerous , as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear .
if he fall in , good night !
or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west , so honour cross it from the north to south , and let them grapple o , the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare !
imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience .
by heaven , methinks it were an easy leap , to pluck bright honour from the moon , or dive into the bottom of the deep , where could never touch the ground , and pluck up drowned honour by the locks , so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival , all her dignities but out upon this fellowship !
he apprehends a world of figures here , but not the form of what he should attend .
good cousin , give me audience for a while .
i cry you mercy .
those same noble scots that are your prisoners , i keep them all , by god , he shall not have a scot of them , no , if a scot would save his soul , he shall not i keep them , by this hand .
you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes .
those prisoners you shall keep .
nay , i will , that flat he said he would not ransom mortimer , forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer , but i will find him when he lies asleep , and in his ear i holla ! '
nay , i have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but , ' and give it him to keep his anger still in motion .
hear you , cousin , a word .
all studies here i solemnly defy , save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same prince of wales , but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance , i would have him poison with a pot of ale .
farewell , kinsman i talk to you when you are better temper to attend .
why , what a and impatient fool art thou to break into this woman mood , tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own !
why , look you , i am whipp and scourged with rods , nettled and stung with pismires , when i hear of this vile politician , bolingbroke .
in richard time , what do you call the place ? a plague upon it , it is in gloucestershire , was where the madcap duke his uncle kept , his uncle york , where i first bow my knee unto this king of smiles , this bolingbroke , ! when you and he came back from ravenspurgh .
at berkley castle .
you say true why , what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me !
look , his infant fortune came to age , ' and harry percy , ' and cousin , ' o , the devil take such cozeners !
god forgive me !
good uncle , tell your tale , i have done .
nay , if you have not , to it again , we will stay your leisure .
i have done , i ' faith .
then once more to your scottish prisoners .
deliver them up without their ransom straight , and make the douglas ' son your only mean for powers in scotland , which , for divers reasons which i shall send you written , be assured , will easily be granted .
you , my lord , to northumberland your son in scotland being thus employ , shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate , well beloved , the archbishop .
of york , is it not ?
true , who bears hard his brother death at bristol , the lord scroop .
i speak not this in estimation , as what i think might be , but what i know is ruminated , plotted and set down , and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on .
i smell it upon my life , it will do well .
before the game is afoot , thou still slip .
why , it can not choose but be a noble plot , and then the power of scotland and of york , to join with mortimer , ha ?
and so they shall .
in faith , it is exceedingly well aim .
and is no little reason bids us speed , to save our heads by raising of a head , for , bear ourselves as even as we can , the king will always think him in our debt , and think we think ourselves unsatisfied , till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love .
he does , he does we be revenged on him .
cousin , farewell no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course .
when time is ripe , which will be suddenly , i steal to glendower and lord mortimer , where you and douglas and our powers at once , as i will fashion it , shall happily meet , to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms , which now we hold at much uncertainty .
farewell , good brother we shall thrive , i trust .
uncle , adieu o , let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport !

come , neighbour mugs , we call up the gentleman they will along with company , for they have great charge .
exeunt carriers what , ho !
chamberlain !
within at hand , quoth .
that even as fair as at hand , quoth the chamberlain , for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from labouring , thou layest the plot how .
enter chamberlain good morrow , master gadshill .
it holds current that i told you yesternight there a franklin in the wild of kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold i heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper , a kind of auditor , one that hath abundance of charge too , god knows what .
they are up already , and call for eggs and butter , they will away presently .
sirrah , if they meet not with saint nicholas ' clerks , i give thee this neck .
no , i none of it i pray thee keep that for the hangman , for i know thou worshippest nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may .
what talkest thou to me of the hangman ?
if i hang , i make a fat pair of gallows , for if i hang , old sir john hangs with me , and thou knowest he is no starveling .
tut !
there are other trojans that thou dreamest not of , the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace , that would , if matters should be looked into , for their own credit sake , make all whole .
i am joined with no rakers , no sixpenny strikers , none of these mad mustachio , but with nobility and tranquillity , burgomasters and great oneyers , such as can hold in , such as will strike sooner than speak , and speak sooner than drink , and drink sooner than pray and yet , zounds , i lie , for they pray continually to their saint , the commonwealth , or rather , not pray to her , but prey on her , for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots .

she will , she will , justice hath liquored her .

exeunt scene iii .
warkworth castle enter hotspur , solus , reading a letter for mine own part , my lord , i could be well contented to be there , in respect of the love i bear your house . '
he could be contented why is he not , then ?
in respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this , he loves his own barn better than he loves our house .
let me see some more .
purpose you undertake is dangerous , ' why , that certain is dangerous to take a cold , to sleep , to drink , but i tell you , my lord fool , out of this nettle , danger , we pluck this flower , safety .
purpose you undertake is dangerous , the friends you have named uncertain , the time itself unsorted , and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition . '
say you so , say you so ?
i say unto you again , you are a shallow cowardly hind , and you lie .
what a is this !
by the lord , our plot is a good plot as ever was laid , our friends true and constant a good plot , good friends , and full of expectation , an excellent plot , very good friends .
what a rogue is this !
why , my lord of york commends the plot and the general course of action .
, an i were now by this rascal , i could brain him with his lady fan .
is there not my father , my uncle and myself ?
lord edmund mortimer , my lord of york and owen glendower ?
is there not besides the douglas ?

i must leave you within these two hours .
o , my good lord , why are you thus alone ?
for what offence have i this fortnight been a banish woman from my harry bed ?
tell me , sweet lord , what that takes from thee thy stomach , pleasure and thy golden sleep ?
why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth , and start so often when thou alone ?
why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks , and given my treasures and my rights of thee to musing and cursed melancholy ?
in thy faint slumbers i by thee have watch , and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars , speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed , cry !
to the field ! '
and thou hast talk of sallies and retires , of trenches , tents , of palisadoes , frontiers , parapets , of basilisks , of cannon , culverin , of prisoners ' ransom and of soldiers slain , and all the currents of a heady fight .
thy spirit within thee hath been so at war and thus hath so bestirr thee in thy sleep , that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow like bubbles in a stream , and in thy face strange motions have appear , such as we see when men restrain their breath on some great sudden hest .
o , what portents are these ?
some heavy business hath my lord in hand , and i must know it , else he loves me not .
what , ho !
enter servant is gilliams with the packet gone ?

i fear my brother mortimer doth stir about his title , and hath sent for you to line his enterprise but if you go , so far afoot , i shall be weary , love .
come , come , you paraquito , answer me directly unto this question that i ask in faith , i break thy little finger , harry , an if thou wilt not tell me all things true .
away , away , you trifler !
love !
i love thee not , i care not for thee , kate this is no world to play with mammets and to tilt with lips we must have bloody noses and crack crowns , and pass them current too .
god me , my horse !
what thou , kate ?
what thou have with me ?
do you not love me ?
do you not , indeed ?
well , do not then , for since you love me not , i will not love myself .
do you not love me ?
nay , tell me if you speak in jest or no .
come , wilt thou see me ride ?
and when i am on horseback , i will swear i love thee infinitely .
but hark you , kate , i must not have you henceforth question me whither i go , nor reason whereabout whither i must , i must , and , to conclude , this evening must i leave you , gentle kate .
i know you wise , but yet no farther wise than harry percy wife constant you are , but yet a woman and for secrecy , no lady closer , for i well believe thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know , and so far will i trust thee , gentle kate .
how !
so far ?
not an inch further .
but hark you , kate whither i go , thither shall you go too , will i set forth , you .
will this content you , kate ?
it must of force .

the tavern , eastcheap .
enter prince henry and poins ned , prithee , come out of that fat room , and lend me thy hand to laugh a little .

with three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads .
i have sounded the very of humility .
sirrah , i am sworn brother to a leash of drawers , and can call them all by their christen names , as tom , dick , and francis .
they take it already upon their salvation , that though i be but the prince of wales , yet i am king of courtesy , and tell me flatly i am no proud jack , like falstaff , but a corinthian , a lad of mettle , a good boy , by the lord , so they call me , and when i am king of england , i shall command all the good lads in eastcheap .
they call drinking deep , dyeing scarlet , and when you breathe in your watering , they cry ! '
and bid you play it off .
to conclude , i am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour , that i can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life .
i tell thee , ned , thou hast lost much honour , that thou wert not with me in this sweet action .
but , sweet ned , to sweeten which name of ned , i give thee this pennyworth of sugar , clapped even now into my hand by an , one that never spake other english in his life than shillings and sixpence ' and are welcome , ' with this shrill addition , , anon , sir !

but , ned , to drive away the time till falstaff come , i prithee , do thou stand in some , while i question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar , and do thou never leave calling , ' that his tale to me may be nothing but . '

i am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the old days of goodman adam to the pupil age of this present twelve at midnight .
francis what , francis ?
anon , anon , sir .
exit that ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot , and yet the son of a woman !
his industry is upstairs and downstairs , his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning .
i am not yet of percy mind , the hotspur of the north , he that kills me some six or seven dozen of scots at a breakfast , washes his hands , and says to his wife upon this quiet life !
i want work . '
' o my sweet harry , ' says she , many hast thou killed ? '
my roan horse a drench , ' says he , and answers fourteen , ' an hour after , ' a trifle , a trifle . '

titan , that melted at the sweet tale of the sun !
if thou didst , then behold that compound .
you rogue , here lime in this sack too there is nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it .
a villanous coward !
go thy ways , old jack , die when thou wilt , if manhood , good manhood , be not forgot upon the face of the earth , then am i a shotten herring .
there live not three good men unhanged in england , and one of them is fat and grows old god help the while !
a bad world , i say .
i would i were a weaver , i could sing psalms or any thing .
a plague of all cowards , i say still .
how now , !
what mutter you ?
a king son !
if i do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath , and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of , i never wear hair on my face more .

answer me to that and poins there ?

i call thee coward !
i see thee damned ere i call thee coward but i would give a thousand pound i could run as fast as thou canst .
you are straight enough in the shoulders , you care not who sees your back call you that backing of your friends ?
a plague upon such backing !
give me them that will face me .
give me a cup of sack i am a rogue , if i drunk .
o villain !
thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last .
all one for that .
he drinks a plague of all cowards , still say i .
what the matter ?
what the matter !
there be four of us here have a thousand pound this day morning .
where is it , jack ?
where is it ?
where is it !
taken from us it is a hundred upon poor four of us .
what , a hundred , man ?
i am a rogue , if i were not at with a dozen of them two hours together .
i have by miracle .
i am eight times thrust through the doublet , four through the hose , my buckler cut through and through , my sword hacked like a ecce signum !
i never dealt better since i was a man all would not do .
a plague of all cowards !
let them speak if they speak more or less than truth , they are villains and the sons of darkness .
speak , sirs , how was it ?
we four set upon some dozen sixteen at least , my lord .
and bound them .
no , no , they were not bound .
you rogue , they were bound , every man of them , or i am a jew else , an ebrew jew .
as we were sharing , some six or seven fresh men set upon us and unbound the rest , and then come in the other .
what , fought you with them all ?
all !
i know not what you call all , but if i fought not with fifty of them , i am a bunch of radish if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old jack , then am i no creature .
pray god you have not murdered some of them .
nay , that past praying for i have peppered two of them , two i am sure i have paid , two rogues in buckram suits .
i tell thee what , hal , if i tell thee a lie , spit in my face , call me horse .
thou knowest my old ward , here i lay and thus i bore my point .
four rogues in buckram let drive at me what , four ?
thou saidst but two even now .
four , hal , i told thee four .
ay , ay , he said four .
these four came all , and mainly thrust at me .
i made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target , thus .
seven ?
why , there were but four even now .
in buckram ?
ay , four , in buckram suits .
seven , by these hilts , or i am a villain else .
prithee , let him alone , we shall have more anon .
dost thou hear me , hal ?
ay , and mark thee too , jack .
do so , for it is worth the listening to .
these nine in buckram that i told thee of so , two more already .
their points being broken , down fell their hose .
began to give me ground but i followed me close , came in foot and hand , and with a thought seven of the eleven i paid .
o monstrous !
eleven buckram men grown out of two !
but , as the devil would have it , three misbegotten knaves in kendal green came at my back and let drive at me , for it was so dark , hal , that thou couldst not see thy hand .
these lies are like their father that begets them , gross as a mountain , open , palpable .
why , thou guts , thou fool , thou whoreson , obscene , grease , what , art thou mad ?
art thou mad ?
is not the truth the truth ?
why , how couldst thou know these men in kendal green , when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand ?
come , tell us your reason what sayest thou to this ?
come , your reason , jack , your reason .
what , upon compulsion ?
, an i were at the strappado , or all the racks in the world , i would not tell you on compulsion .
give you a reason on compulsion !
if reasons were as plentiful as blackberries , i would give no man a reason upon compulsion , i .
i be no longer guilty of this sin , this sanguine coward , this , this , this huge hill of flesh , , you starveling , you , you dried neat tongue , you bull pizzle , you !
o for breath to utter what is like thee !
you , you sheath , you bowcase , you vile , well , breathe awhile , and then to it again and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons , hear me speak but this .
mark , jack .
we two saw you four set on four and bound them , and were masters of their wealth .
mark now , how a plain tale shall put you down .
then did we two set on you four , and , with a word , you from your prize , and have it , yea , and can show it you here in the house and , falstaff , you carried your guts away as nimbly , with as quick dexterity , and roared for mercy and still run and roared , as ever i heard .
what a slave art thou , to hack thy sword as thou hast done , and then say it was in fight !
what trick , what device , what , canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame ?
come , let hear , jack , what trick hast thou now ?
by the lord , i knew ye as well as he that made ye .
why , hear you , my masters was it for me to kill the ?
should i turn upon the true prince ?
why , thou knowest i am as valiant as hercules but beware instinct , the lion will not touch the true prince .
instinct is a great matter , i was now a coward on instinct .
i shall think the better of myself and thee during my life , i for a valiant lion , and thou for a true prince .
but , by the lord , lads , i am glad you have the money .
hostess , clap to the doors watch , pray .
gallants , lads , boys , hearts of gold , all the titles of good fellowship come to you !
what , shall we be merry ?
shall we have a play extempore ?
content , and the argument shall be thy running away .
ah , no more of that , hal , an thou lovest me !
enter hostess o jesu , my lord the prince !
how now , my lady the hostess !
what sayest thou to me ?
marry , my lord , there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you he says he comes from your father .
give him as much as will make him a royal man , and send him back again to my mother .
what manner of man is he ?
an old man .
what doth gravity out of his bed at midnight ?
shall i give him his answer ?
prithee , do , jack .
, and i send him packing .
exit falstaff now , sirs by ' r lady , you fought fair , so did you , peto , so did you , bardolph you are lions too , you ran away upon instinct , you will not touch the true prince , no , fie !
, i ran when i saw others run .
, tell me now in earnest , how came falstaff sword so hacked ?
why , he hacked it with his dagger , and said he would swear truth out of england but he would make you believe it was done in fight , and persuaded us to do the like .
yea , and to tickle our noses with to make them bleed , and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men .
i did that i did not this seven year before , i blushed to hear his monstrous devices .
o villain , thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago , and wert taken with the manner , and ever since thou hast blushed extempore .
thou hadst fire and sword on thy side , and yet thou rannest away what instinct hadst thou for it ?
my lord , do you see these meteors ?
do you behold these exhalations ?
i do .
what think you they portend ?
hot livers and cold purses .
choler , my lord , if rightly taken .
no , if rightly taken , halter .
falstaff here comes lean jack , here comes .
how now , my sweet creature of bombast !
how long ago , jack , since thou sawest thine own knee ?
my own knee !
when i was about thy years , hal , i was not an eagle talon in the waist , i could have crept into any alderman a plague of sighing and grief !
it blows a man up like a bladder .
there villanous news abroad here was sir john bracy from your father , you must to the court in the morning .
that same mad fellow of the north , percy , and he of wales , that gave amamon the bastinado and made lucifer cuckold and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a welsh hook what a plague call you him ?
o , glendower .
owen , owen , the same , and his mortimer , and old northumberland , and that sprightly scot of scots , douglas , that runs o ' horseback up a hill perpendicular , he that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying .
you have hit it .
so did he never the sparrow .
well , that rascal hath good mettle in him , he will not run .
why , what a rascal art thou then , to praise him so for running !
o ' horseback , ye cuckoo , but afoot he will not budge a foot .
yes , jack , upon instinct .
i grant ye , upon instinct .
well , he is there too , and one mordake , and a thousand more worcester is stolen away , thy father beard is turned white with the news you may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel .
why , then , it is like , if there come a hot june and this civil buffeting hold , we shall buy maidenheads as they buy , by the hundreds .
by the mass , lad , thou sayest true , it is like we shall have good trading that way .
but tell me , hal , art not thou horrible afeard ?
thou being , could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend douglas , that spirit percy , and that devil glendower ?
art thou not horribly afraid ?
doth not thy blood thrill at it ?
not a whit , i ' faith , i lack some of thy instinct .
well , thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father if thou love me , practise an answer .
do thou stand for my father , and examine me upon the particulars of my life .
shall i ?
content this chair shall be my state , this dagger my sceptre , and this cushion my crown .
thy state is taken for a , thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger , and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown !
well , an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee , now shalt thou be moved .
give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red , that it may be thought i have wept , for i must speak in passion , and i will do it in king cambyses ' vein .
well , here is my leg .
and here is my speech .
stand aside , nobility .
o jesu , this is excellent sport , i ' faith !
weep not , sweet queen , for trickling tears are vain .
o , the father , how he holds his countenance !
for god sake , lords , convey my tristful queen , for tears do stop the of her eyes .
o jesu , he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever i see !
peace , good , peace , good .
harry , i do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time , but also how thou art accompanied for though the camomile , the more it is trodden on the faster it grows , yet youth , the more it is wasted the sooner it wears .
that thou art my son , i have partly thy mother word , partly my own opinion , but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a of thy nether lip , that doth warrant me .
if then thou be son to me , here lies the point , why , being son to me , art thou so pointed at ?
shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries ?
a question not to be asked .
shall the sun of england prove a thief and take purses ?
a question to be asked .
there is a thing , harry , which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch , as ancient writers do report , doth defile , so doth the company thou keepest for , harry , now i do not speak to thee in drink but in tears , not in pleasure but in passion , not in words only , but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom i have often noted in thy company , but i know not his name .
what manner of man , an it like your majesty ?
a goodly portly man , i ' faith , and a corpulent , of a cheerful look , a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage , and , as i think , his age some fifty , or , by ' r lady , inclining to three score , and now i remember me , his name is falstaff if that man should be lewdly given , he deceiveth me , for , harry , i see virtue in his looks .
if then the tree may be known by the fruit , as the fruit by the tree , then , peremptorily i speak it , there is virtue in that falstaff him keep with , the rest banish .
and tell me now , thou naughty varlet , tell me , where hast thou been this month ?
dost thou speak like a king ?
do thou stand for me , and i play my father .
depose me ?
if thou dost it half so gravely , so majestically , both in word and matter , hang me up by the heels for a or a poulter hare .
well , here i am set .
and here i stand judge , my masters .
now , harry , whence come you ?
my noble lord , from eastcheap .
the complaints i hear of thee are grievous .
, my lord , they are false nay , i tickle ye for a young prince , i ' faith .
swearest thou , ungracious boy ?
henceforth look on me .
thou art violently carried away from grace there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man , a tun of man is thy companion .
why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours , that of beastliness , that swollen parcel of dropsies , that huge bombard of sack , that stuffed of guts , that roasted manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly , that reverend vice , that grey iniquity , that father ruffian , that vanity in years ?
wherein is he good , but to taste sack and drink it ?
wherein neat and cleanly , but to carve a capon and eat it ?
wherein cunning , but in craft ?
wherein crafty , but in villany ?
wherein villanous , but in all things ?
wherein worthy , but in nothing ?
i would your grace would take me with you whom means your grace ?
that villanous abominable misleader of youth , falstaff , that old satan .
my lord , the man i know .
i know thou dost .
but to say i know more harm in him than in myself , were to say more than i know .
that he is old , the more the pity , his white hairs do witness it , but that he is , saving your reverence , a whoremaster , that i utterly deny .
if sack and sugar be a fault , god help the wicked !
if to be old and merry be a sin , then many an old host that i know is damned if to be fat be to be hated , then pharaoh lean kine are to be loved .
no , my good lord , banish peto , banish bardolph , banish poins but for sweet jack falstaff , kind jack falstaff , true jack falstaff , valiant jack falstaff , and therefore more valiant , being , as he is , old jack falstaff , banish not him thy harry company , banish not him thy harry company banish plump jack , and banish all the world .
i do , i will .
a knocking heard exeunt hostess , francis , and bardolph bardolph , running o , my lord , my lord !
the sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door .
out , ye rogue !
play out the play i have much to say in the behalf of that falstaff .
the hostess o jesu , my lord , my lord !
heigh , heigh !
the devil rides upon a fiddlestick what the matter ?
the sheriff and all the watch are at the door they are come to search the house .
shall i let them in ?
dost thou hear , hal ?
never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit thou art essentially mad , without seeming so .
and thou a natural coward , without instinct .
i deny your major if you will deny the sheriff , so , if not , let him enter if i become not a cart as well as another man , a plague on my bringing up !
i hope i shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another .
go , hide thee behind the arras the rest walk up above .
now , my masters , for a true face and good conscience .
both which i have had but their date is out , and therefore i hide me .
call in the sheriff .
exeunt all except prince henry and peto enter sheriff and the carrier now , master sheriff , what is your will with me ?
first , pardon me , my lord .
a hue and cry hath follow certain men unto this house .
what men ?
one of them is well known , my gracious lord , a gross fat man .
as fat as butter .
the man , i do assure you , is not here , for i myself at this time have employ him .
and , sheriff , i will engage my word to thee that i will , by , send him to answer thee , or any man , for any thing he shall be charged withal and so let me entreat you leave the house .
i will , my lord .
there are two gentlemen have in this robbery lost three hundred marks .
it may be so if he have robb these men , he shall be answerable , and so farewell .
good night , my noble lord .

act iii scene bangor .
the archdeacon house .
enter hotspur , worcester , mortimer , and glendower these promises are fair , the parties sure , and our induction full of prosperous hope .
lord mortimer , and cousin glendower , will you sit down ?
and uncle worcester a plague upon it !
i have forgot the map .
no , here it is .
sit , cousin percy , sit , good cousin hotspur , for by that name as oft as lancaster doth speak of you , his cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven .
and you in hell , as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of .
i can not blame him at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes , of burning cressets , and at my birth the frame and huge foundation of the earth shaked like a coward .
why , so it would have done at the same season , if your mother cat had but kittened , though yourself had never been born .
i say the earth did shake when i was born .
and i say the earth was not of my mind , if you suppose as fearing you it shook .
the heavens were all on fire , the earth did tremble .
o , then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire , and not in fear of your nativity .
diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions , oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinch and vex by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb , which , for enlargement striving , shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and towers .
at your birth our grandam earth , having this distemperature , in passion shook .
cousin , of many men i do not bear these crossings .
give me leave to tell you once again that at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes , the goats ran from the mountains , and the herds were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields .
these signs have mark me extraordinary , and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men .
where is he living , clipp in with the sea that chides the banks of england , scotland , wales , which calls me pupil , or hath read to me ?
and bring him out that is but woman son can trace me in the tedious ways of art and hold me pace in deep experiments .
i think there no man speaks better welsh .
i to dinner .
peace , cousin percy , you will make him mad .
i can call spirits from the vasty deep .
why , so can i , or so can any man , but will they come when you do call for them ?
why , i can teach you , cousin , to command the devil .
and i can teach thee , coz , to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil .
if thou have power to raise him , bring him hither , and i be sworn i have power to shame him hence .
o , while you live , tell truth and shame the devil !
come , come , no more of this unprofitable chat .
three times hath henry bolingbroke made head against my power , thrice from the banks of wye and severn have i sent him bootless home and back .
home without boots , and in foul weather too !
how he agues , in the devil name ?
come , here the map shall we divide our right according to our threefold order ?
the archdeacon hath divided it into three limits very equally england , from trent and severn hitherto , by south and east is to my part assign all westward , wales beyond the severn shore , and all the fertile land within that bound , to owen glendower and , dear coz , to you the remnant northward , lying off from trent .
and our indentures tripartite are drawn , which being sealed interchangeably , a business that this night may execute , , cousin percy , you and i and my good lord of worcester will set forth to meet your father and the scottish power , as is appointed us , at shrewsbury .
my father glendower is not ready yet , not shall we need his help these fourteen days .
within that space you may have drawn together your tenants , friends and neighbouring gentlemen .
a shorter time shall send me to you , lords and in my conduct shall your ladies come , from whom you now must steal and take no leave , for there will be a world of water shed upon the parting of your wives and you .
methinks my moiety , north from burton here , in quantity equals not one of yours see how this river comes me cranking in , and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge , a monstrous cantle out .
i have the current in this place damm up , and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel , fair and evenly , it shall not wind with such a deep indent , to rob me of so rich a bottom here .
not wind ?
it shall , it must , you see it doth .
yea , but mark how he bears his course , and runs me up with like advantage on the other side , gelding the opposed continent as much as on the other side it takes from you .
yea , but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land , and then he runs straight and even .
i have it so a little charge will do it .
i not have it alter .
will not you ?
no , nor you shall not .
who shall say me nay ?
why , that will i .
let me not understand you , then , speak it in welsh .
i can speak english , lord , as well as you , for i was train up in the english court , where , being but young , i framed to the harp many an english ditty lovely well and gave the tongue a helpful ornament , a virtue that was never seen in you .
marry , and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same metre , i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn , or a dry wheel grate on the , and that would set my teeth nothing on edge , nothing so much as mincing poetry is like the forced gait of a shuffling nag .
come , you shall have trent turn .
i do not care i give thrice so much land to any friend , but in the way of bargain , mark ye me , i cavil on the ninth part of a hair .
are the indentures drawn ?
shall we be gone ?
the moon shines fair , you may away by night i haste the writer and withal break with your wives of your departure hence i am afraid my daughter will run mad , so much she doteth on her mortimer .
exit glendower fie , cousin percy !
how you cross my father !
i can not choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant , of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies , and of a dragon and a finless fish , a griffin and a moulten raven , a couching lion and a ramping cat , and such a deal of stuff as puts me from my faith .
i tell you what , he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils ' names that were his lackeys i cried , ' and , go to , ' but mark him not a word .
o , he is as tedious as a tired horse , a railing wife , worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill , far , than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any in christendom .
in faith , he is a worthy gentleman , exceedingly well read , and profited in strange concealments , valiant as a lion and as wondrous affable and as bountiful as mines of india .
shall i tell you , cousin ?
he holds your temper in a high respect and curbs himself even of his natural scope when you come his humour , faith , he does i warrant you , that man is not alive might so have tempted him as you have done , without the taste of danger and reproof but do not use it oft , let me entreat you .
in faith , my lord , you are too , and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite beside his patience .
you must needs learn , lord , to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness , courage , blood , and that the dearest grace it renders you , yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage , defect of manners , want of government , pride , haughtiness , opinion and disdain the least of which haunting a nobleman loseth men hearts and leaves behind a stain upon the beauty of all parts besides , beguiling them of commendation .
well , i am school good manners be your speed !
here come our wives , and let us take our leave .
glendower with the ladies this is the deadly spite that angers me , my wife can speak no english , i no welsh .
my daughter weeps she will not part with you , she be a soldier too , she to the wars .
good father , tell her that she and my aunt percy shall follow in your conduct speedily .
glendower speaks to her in welsh , and she answers him in the same she is desperate here , a peevish harlotry , one that no persuasion can do good upon .
the lady speaks in welsh i understand thy looks that pretty welsh which thou down from these swelling heavens i am too perfect in , and , but for shame , in such a parley should i answer thee .
the lady speaks again in welsh i understand thy kisses and thou mine , and that a feeling disputation but i will never be a truant , love , till i have learned thy language , for thy tongue makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn , sung by a fair queen in a summer bower , with ravishing division , to her lute .
nay , if you melt , then will she run mad .
the lady speaks again in welsh o , i am ignorance itself in this !
she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down and rest your gentle head upon her lap , and she will sing the song that pleaseth you and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep .
charming your blood with pleasing heaviness , making such difference wake and sleep as is the difference betwixt day and night the hour before the team begins his golden progress in the east .
with all my heart i sit and hear her sing by that time will our book , i think , be drawn do so , and those musicians that shall play to you hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence , and straight they shall be here sit , and attend .
come , kate , thou art perfect in lying down come , quick , quick , that i may lay my head in thy lap .
go , ye giddy goose .
the music plays now i perceive the devil understands welsh , and is no marvel he is so humorous .
by ' r lady , he is a good musician .
then should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours .
lie still , ye thief , and hear the lady sing in welsh .
i had rather hear lady , my brach , howl in irish .
wouldst thou have thy head broken ?
no .
then be still .
neither , is a woman fault .
now god help thee !
to the welsh lady bed .
what that ?
peace !
she sings .
here the lady sings a welsh song come , kate , i have your song too .
not mine , in good sooth .
not yours , in good sooth !
heart !
you swear like a wife .
you , in good sooth , ' and true as i live , ' and god shall mend me , ' and sure as day , ' and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths , as if thou never further than finsbury .
swear me , kate , like a lady as thou art , a good oath , and leave sooth , ' and such protest of , to and .
come , sing .
i will not sing .
is the next way to turn tailor , or be teacher .
an the indentures be drawn , i away within these two hours , and so , come in when ye will .
exit come , come , lord mortimer , you are as slow as hot lord percy is on fire to go .
by this our book is drawn , we but seal , and then to horse immediately .
with all my heart .
exeunt scene ii .
london .
the palace .
enter king henry iv , prince henry , and others lords , give us leave , the prince of wales and i must have some private conference , but be near at hand , for we shall presently have need of you .
exeunt lords i know not whether god will have it so , for some displeasing service i have done , that , in his secret doom , out of my blood he breed revengement and a scourge for me , but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only mark for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings .
tell me else , could such inordinate and low desires , such poor , such bare , such lewd , such mean attempts , such barren pleasures , rude society , as thou art match withal and grafted to , accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart ?
so please your majesty , i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg , as , in reproof of many tales devised , which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear , by smiling and base , i may , for some things true , wherein my youth hath faulty wander and irregular , find pardon on my true submission .
god pardon thee !
yet let me wonder , harry , at thy affections , which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors .
thy place in council thou hast rudely lost .
which by thy younger brother is supplied , and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruin , and the soul of every man prophetically doth forethink thy fall .
had i so lavish of my presence been , so in the eyes of men , so stale and cheap to vulgar company , opinion , that did help me to the crown , had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment , a fellow of no mark nor likelihood .
by being seldom seen , i could not stir but like a comet i was wonder at , that men would tell their children is he , ' others would say , which is bolingbroke ? '
and then i stole all courtesy from heaven , and dress myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men hearts , loud shouts and salutations from their mouths , even in the presence of the crowned king .
thus did i keep my person fresh and new , my presence , like a robe pontifical , seen but wonder at and so my state , seldom but sumptuous , showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity .
the skipping king , he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits , soon kindled and soon burnt , carded his state , mingled his royalty with capering fools , had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance , against his name , to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative , grew a companion to the common streets , enfeoff himself to popularity , that , being daily swallow by men eyes , they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness , whereof a little more than a little is by much too much .
so when he had occasion to be seen , he was but as the cuckoo is in june , heard , not regarded , seen , but with such eyes as , sick and blunted with community , afford no extraordinary gaze , such as is bent on majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes , but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down , slept in his face and render such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries , being with his presence glutted , gorged and full .
and in that very line , harry , standest thou , for thou has lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is of thy common sight , save mine , which hath desired to see thee more , which now doth that i would not have it do , make blind itself with foolish tenderness .
i shall hereafter , my thrice gracious lord , be more myself .
for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh , and even as i was then is percy now .
now , by my sceptre and my soul to boot , he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession , for of no right , nor colour like to right , he doth fill fields with harness in the realm , turns head against the lion armed jaws , and , being no more in debt to years than thou , leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms .
what honour hath he got against renowned douglas !
whose high deeds , whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur , mars in swathling clothes , this infant warrior , in his enterprises discomfited great douglas , him once , enlarged him and made a friend of him , to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne .
and what say you to this ?
percy , northumberland , the archbishop grace of york , douglas , mortimer , capitulate against us and are up .
but wherefore do i tell these news to thee ?
why , harry , do i tell thee of my foes , which art my and dearest enemy ?
thou that art like enough , through vassal fear , base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percy pay , to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns , to show how much thou art degenerate .
do not think so , you shall not find it so and god forgive them that so much have sway your majesty good thoughts away from me !
i will redeem all this on percy head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son , when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favours in a bloody mask , which , wash away , shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day , it lights , that this same child of honour and renown , this gallant hotspur , this knight , and your harry chance to meet .
for every honour sitting on his helm , would they were multitudes , and on my head my shames redoubled !
for the time will come , that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities .
percy is but my factor , good my lord , to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf , and i will call him to so strict account , that he shall render every glory up , yea , even the slightest worship of his time , or i will tear the reckoning from his heart .
this , in the name of god , i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform , i do beseech your majesty may salve the wounds of my intemperance if not , the end of life cancels all bands , and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow .
a hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein .
enter blunt how now , good blunt ?
thy looks are full of speed .
so hath the business that i come to speak of .
lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word that douglas and the english rebels met the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury a mighty and a fearful head they are , if promises be kept on every hand , as ever offer foul play in the state .
the earl of westmoreland set forth , with him my son , lord john of lancaster , for this advertisement is five days old on wednesday next , harry , you shall set forward , on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting is bridgenorth and , harry , you shall march through gloucestershire , by which account , our business valued , some twelve days hence our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet .
our hands are full of business let away , advantage feeds him fat , while men delay .
exeunt eastcheap .
the tavern .
enter falstaff and bardolph bardolph , am i not fallen away vilely since this last action ?
do i not bate ?
do i not dwindle ?
why my skin hangs about me like an like an old lady loose gown , i am withered like an old .
well , i repent , and that suddenly , while i am in some liking , i shall be out of heart shortly , and then i shall have no strength to repent .
an i have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of , i am a peppercorn , a brewer horse the inside of a church !
company , villanous company , hath been the spoil of me .
sir john , you are so fretful , you can not live long .
why , there is it come sing me a bawdy song , make me merry .
i was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be , virtuous enough , swore little , diced not above seven times a week , went to a once in a quarter of an hour , paid money that i borrowed , three of four times , lived well and in good compass and now i live out of all order , out of all compass .
why , you are so fat , sir john , that you must needs be out of all compass , out of all reasonable compass , sir john .
do thou amend thy face , and i amend my life thou art our admiral , thou bearest the lantern in the poop , but is in the nose of thee , thou art the knight of the burning lamp .
why , sir john , my face does you no harm .
no , i be sworn , i make as good use of it as many a man doth of a or a memento mori i never see thy face but i think upon and dives that lived in purple , for there he is in his robes , burning , burning .
if thou wert any way given to virtue , i would swear by thy face , my oath should be this fire , that god angel ' but thou art altogether given over , and wert indeed , but for the light in thy face , the son of utter darkness .
when thou rannest up gadshill in the night to catch my horse , if i did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire , there no purchase in money .
o , thou art a perpetual triumph , an everlasting !
thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches , walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler in europe .
i have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years , god reward me for it !
, i would my face were in your belly !
!
so should i be sure to be .
enter hostess how now , dame partlet the hen !
have you inquired yet who picked my pocket ?
why , sir john , what do you think , sir john ?
do you think i keep thieves in my house ?
i have searched , i have inquired , so has my husband , man by man , boy by boy , servant by servant the tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before .
ye lie , hostess bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair , and i be sworn my pocket was picked .
go to , you are a woman , go .
who , i ?
no , i defy thee god light , i was never called so in mine own house before .
go to , i know you well enough .
no , sir john , you do not know me , sir john .
i know you , sir john you owe me money , sir john , and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it i bought you a dozen of shirts to your back .
dowlas , filthy dowlas i have given them away to bakers ' wives , and they have made bolters of them .
now , as i am a true woman , holland of eight shillings an ell .
you owe money here besides , sir john , for your diet and , and money lent you , four and twenty pound .
he had his part of it , let him pay .
he ?
alas , he is poor , he hath nothing .
how !
poor ?
look upon his face , what call you rich ?
let them coin his nose , let them coin his cheeks ill not pay a denier .
what , will you make a younker of me ?
shall i not take mine case in mine inn but i shall have my pocket picked ?
i have lost a of my grandfather worth forty mark .
o jesu , i have heard the prince tell him , i know not how oft , that ring was copper !
how !
the prince is a jack , a , an he were here , i would cudgel him like a dog , if he would say so .
enter prince henry and peto , marching , and falstaff meets them playing on his truncheon like a life how now , lad !
is the wind in that door , i ' faith ?
must we all march ?
yea , two and two , newgate fashion .
my lord , i pray you , hear me .
what sayest thou , mistress quickly ?
how doth thy husband ?
i love him well , he is an honest man .
good my lord , hear me .
prithee , let her alone , and list to me .
what sayest thou , jack ?
the other night i fell asleep here behind the arras and had my pocket picked this house is turned , they pick pockets .
what didst thou lose , jack ?
wilt thou believe me , hal ?
three or four bonds of forty pound apiece , and a of my grandfather .
a trifle , some matter .
so i told him , my lord , and i said i heard your grace say so and , my lord , he speaks most vilely of you , like a man as he is , and said he would cudgel you .
what !
he did not ?
there neither faith , truth , nor womanhood in me else .
there no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune , nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox , and for womanhood , maid marian may be the deputy wife of the ward to thee .
go , you thing , go say , what thing ?
what thing ?
what thing !
why , a thing to thank god on .
i am no thing to thank god on , i would thou shouldst know it , i am an honest man wife and , setting thy knighthood aside , thou art a knave to call me so .
setting thy womanhood aside , thou art a beast to say otherwise .
say , what beast , thou knave , thou ?
what beast !
why , an otter .
an otter , sir john !
why an otter ?
why , she neither fish nor flesh , a man knows not where to have her .
thou art an unjust man in saying so thou or any man knows where to have me , thou knave , thou !
thou sayest true , hostess , and he slanders thee most grossly .
so he doth you , my lord , and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound .
sirrah , do i owe you a thousand pound ?
a thousand pound , ha !
a million thy love is worth a million thou owest me thy love .
nay , my lord , he called you jack , and said he would cudgel you .
did i , bardolph ?
indeed , sir john , you said so .
yea , if he said my ring was copper .
i say is copper darest thou be as good as thy word now ?
why , hal , thou knowest , as thou art but man , i dare but as thou art prince , i fear thee as i fear the roaring of a lion whelp .
and why not as the lion ?
the king is to be feared as the lion dost thou think i fear thee as i fear thy father ?
nay , an i do , i pray god my girdle break .
o , if it should , how would thy guts fall about thy knees !
but , sirrah , there no room for faith , truth , nor honesty in this bosom of thine , it is all filled up with guts and midriff .
charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket !
why , thou whoreson , impudent , embossed rascal , if there were anything in thy pocket but , memorandums of , and one poor of to make thee , if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these , i am a villain and yet you will stand to if , you will not pocket up wrong art thou not ashamed ?
dost thou hear , hal ?
thou knowest in the state of innocency adam fell , and what should poor jack falstaff do in the days of villany ?
thou seest i have more flesh than another man , and therefore more frailty .
you confess then , you picked my pocket ?
it appears so by the story .
hostess , i forgive thee go , make ready breakfast , love thy husband , look to thy servants , cherish thy guests thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason thou seest i am pacified still .
nay , prithee , be gone .
exit hostess now hal , to the news at court for the robbery , lad , how is that answered ?
o , my sweet beef , i must still be good angel to thee the money is paid back again .
o , i do not like that paying back , is a double labour .
i am good friends with my father and may do any thing .
rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest , and do it with unwashed hands too .
do , my lord .
i have procured thee , jack , a charge of foot .
i would it had been of horse .
where shall i find one that can steal well ?
o for a fine thief , of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts !
i am heinously unprovided .
well , god be thanked for these rebels , they offend none but the virtuous i laud them , i praise them .
bardolph !
my lord ?
go bear this letter to lord john of lancaster , to my brother john , this to my lord of westmoreland .
exit bardolph go , peto , to horse , to horse , for thou and i have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time .
exit peto jack , meet me in the temple hall at two in the afternoon .
there shalt thou know thy charge , and there receive money and order for their furniture .
the land is burning , percy stands on high , and either we or they must lower lie .
exit prince henry rare words !
brave world !
hostess , my breakfast , come !
o , i could wish this tavern were my drum !
exit act iv scene i .
the rebel camp near shrewsbury .
enter hotspur , worcester , and douglas well said , my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery , such attribution should the douglas have , as not a soldier of this season stamp should go so general current through the world .
by god , i can not flatter , i do defy the tongues of soothers , but a braver place in my heart love hath no man than yourself nay , task me to my word , approve me , lord .
thou art the king of honour no man so potent breathes upon the ground but i will beard him .
do so , and is well .
enter a messenger with letters what letters hast thou there ? i can but thank you .
these letters come from your father .
letters from him !
why comes he not himself ?
he can not come , my lord , he is grievous sick .
!
how has he the leisure to be sick in such a rustling time ?
who leads his power ?
under whose government come they along ?
his letters bear his mind , not i , my lord .
i prithee , tell me , doth he keep his bed ?
he did , my lord , four days ere i set forth , and at the time of my departure thence he was much fear by his physicians .
i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited his health was never better worth than now .
sick now !
droop now !
this sickness doth infect the very of our enterprise , is catching hither , even to our camp .
he writes me here , that inward sickness and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn , nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own .
yet doth he give us bold advertisement , that with our small conjunction we should on , to see how fortune is disposed to us , for , as he writes , there is no quailing now .
because the king is certainly possess of all our purposes .
what say you to it ?
your father sickness is a maim to us .
a perilous gash , a very limb lopp off and yet , in faith , it is not , his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast ?
to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour ?
it were not good , for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope , the very list , the very utmost bound of all our fortunes .
, and so we should , where now remains a sweet reversion we may boldly spend upon the hope of what is to come in a comfort of retirement lives in this .
a rendezvous , a home to fly unto .
if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs .
but yet i would your father had been here .
the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division it will be thought by some , that know not why he is away , that wisdom , loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause , for well you know we of the offering side must keep aloof from strict arbitrement , and stop all , every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us this absence of your father draws a curtain , that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of .
you strain too far .
i rather of his absence make this use it lends a lustre and more great opinion , a larger dare to our great enterprise , than if the earl were here , for men must think , if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom , with his help we shall it down .
yet all goes well , yet all our joints are whole .
as heart can think there is not such a word spoke of in scotland as this term of fear .
enter sir richard vernon my cousin vernon , welcome , by my soul .
pray god my news be worth a welcome , lord .
the earl of westmoreland , seven thousand strong , is marching hitherwards , with him prince john .
no harm what more ?
and further , i have learn , the king himself in person is set forth , or hitherwards intended speedily , with strong and mighty preparation .
he shall be welcome too .
where is his son , the madcap prince of wales , and his comrades , that daff the world aside , and bid it pass ?
all furnish , all in arms , all plumed like estridges that with the wind baited like eagles having lately bathed , glittering in golden coats , like images , as full of spirit as the month of may , and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer , wanton as youthful goats , wild as young bulls .
i saw young harry , with his beaver on , his cuisses on his thighs , gallantly arm rise from the ground like feather mercury , and vaulted with such ease into his seat , as if an angel dropp down from the clouds , to turn and wind a fiery pegasus and witch the world with noble horsemanship .
no more , no more worse than the sun in march , this praise doth nourish agues .
let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim , and to the maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mailed mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood .
i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours .
come , let me taste my horse , who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall , hot horse to horse , meet and part till one drop down a corse .
o that glendower were come !
there is more news i learn in worcester , as i rode along , he can not draw his power this fourteen days .
that the worst tidings that i hear of yet .
ay , by my faith , that bears a frosty sound .
what may the king whole battle reach unto ?
to thirty thousand .
forty let it be my father and glendower being both away , the powers of us may serve so great a day come , let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near , die all , die merrily .
talk not of dying i am out of fear of death or death hand for this year .
exeunt scene ii .
a public road near coventry .
enter falstaff and bardolph bardolph , get thee before to coventry , fill me a bottle of sack our soldiers shall march through , we to sutton ' tonight .
will you give me money , captain ?
lay out , lay out .
this bottle makes an angel .
an if it do , take it for thy labour , and if it make twenty , take them all , i answer the coinage .
bid my lieutenant peto meet me at town end .
i will , captain farewell .
exit if i be not ashamed of my soldiers , i am a soused gurnet .
i have misused the king press damnably .
i have got , in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers , three hundred and odd pounds .
i press me none but good , yeoman sons , inquire me out contracted bachelors , such as had been asked twice on the banns , such a commodity of warm slaves , as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum , such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt .
i pressed me none but such , with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins ' heads , and they have bought out their services , and now my whole charge consists of ancients , corporals , lieutenants , gentlemen of companies , slaves as ragged as lazarus in the painted cloth , where the glutton dogs licked his sores , and such as indeed were never soldiers , but discarded unjust , younger sons to younger brothers , revolted tapsters and ostlers , the cankers of a calm world and a long peace , ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced ancient and such have i , to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services , that you would think that i had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from , from eating draff and husks .
a mad fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies .
no eye hath seen such scarecrows .
i not march through coventry with them , that flat nay , and the villains march wide betwixt the legs , as if they had gyves on , for indeed i had the most of them out of prison .
there but a shirt and a half in all my company , and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like an herald coat without sleeves , and the shirt , to say the truth , stolen from my host at saint alban , or the innkeeper of daventry .
but that all one , they find linen enough on every hedge .
enter the prince and westmoreland how now , blown jack !
how now , quilt !
what , hal !
how now , mad wag !
what a devil dost thou in warwickshire ?
my good lord of westmoreland , i cry you mercy i thought your honour had already been at shrewsbury .
faith , sir john , is more than time that i were there , and you too , but my powers are there already .
the king , i can tell you , looks for us all we must away all night .
tut , never fear me i am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream .
i think , to steal cream indeed , for thy theft hath already made thee butter .
but tell me , jack , whose fellows are these that come after ?
mine , hal , mine .
i did never see such pitiful rascals .
tut , tut , good enough to toss , food for powder , food for powder , they fill a pit as well as better tush , man , mortal men , mortal men .
ay , but , sir john , methinks they are exceeding poor and bare , too beggarly .
, for their poverty , i know not where they had that , and for their bareness , i am sure they never learned that of me .
no i be sworn , unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare .
but , sirrah , make haste percy is already in the field .
what , is the king encamped ?
he is , sir john i fear we shall stay too long .
well , to the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast fits a dull fighter and a keen guest .
exeunt scene iii .
the rebel camp near shrewsbury .
enter hotspur , worcester , douglas , and vernon we fight with him .
it may not be .
you give him then the advantage .
not a whit .
why say you so ?
looks he not for supply ?
so do we .
his is certain , ours is doubtful .
good cousin , be advised , stir not tonight .
do not , my lord .
you do not counsel well you speak it out of fear and cold heart .
do me no slander , douglas by my life , and i dare well maintain it with my life , if honour bid me on , i hold as little counsel with weak fear as you , my lord , or any scot that this day lives let it be seen in the battle which of us fears .
yea , or .
content .
, say i .
come , come it nay not be .
i wonder much , being men of such great leading as you are , that you foresee not what impediments drag back our expedition certain horse of my cousin vernon are not yet come up your uncle worcester horse came but today , and now their pride and mettle is asleep , their courage with hard labour tame and dull , that not a horse is half the half of himself .
so are the horses of the enemy in general , and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest .
the number of the king exceedeth ours for god sake .
cousin , stay till all come in .
the trumpet sounds a parley enter sir walter blunt i come with gracious offers from the king , if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect .
welcome , sir walter blunt , and would to god you were of our determination !
some of us love you well , and even those some envy your great deservings and good name , because you are not of our quality , but stand against us like an enemy .
and god defend but still i should stand so , so long as out of limit and true rule you stand against anointed majesty .
but to my charge .
the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs , and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility , teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty .
if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot , which he confesseth to be manifold , he bids you name your griefs , and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion .
the king is kind , and well we know the king knows at what time to promise , when to pay .
my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears , and when he was not six and twenty strong , sick in the world regard , wretched and low , a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home , my father gave him welcome to the shore , and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster , to sue his livery and beg his peace , with tears of innocency and terms of zeal , my father , in kind heart and pity moved , swore him assistance and perform it too .
now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him , the more and less came in with cap and knee , met him in boroughs , cities , villages , attended him on bridges , stood in lanes , laid gifts before him , proffer him their oaths , gave him their heirs , as pages follow him even at the heels in golden multitudes .
he presently , as greatness knows itself , steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father , while his blood was poor , upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh , and now , forsooth , takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth , cries out upon abuses , seems to weep over his country wrongs , and by this face , this seeming brow of justice , did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for , proceeded further , cut me off the heads of all the favourites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here , when he was personal in the irish war .
tut , i came not to hear this .
then to the point .
in short time after , he deposed the king , soon after that , deprived him of his life , and in the neck of that , task the whole state to make that worse , suffer his kinsman march , who is , if every owner were well placed , indeed his king , to be engaged in wales , there without ransom to lie forfeited , disgraced me in my happy victories , sought to entrap me by intelligence , rated mine uncle from the , in rage dismiss my father from the court , broke oath on oath , committed wrong on wrong , and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety , and withal to pry into his title , the which we find too indirect for long continuance .
shall i return this answer to the king ?
not so , sir walter we withdraw awhile .
go to the king , and let there be impawn some surety for a safe return again , and in the morning early shall my uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell .
i would you would accept of grace and love .
and may be so we shall .
pray god you do .
exeunt scene iv .
york .
the archbishop palace .
enter the archbishop of york and sir michael hie , good sir michael , bear this sealed brief with winged haste to the lord marshal , this to my cousin scroop , and all the rest to whom they are directed .
if you knew how much they do to import , you would make haste .
my good lord , i guess their tenor .
like enough you do .
, good sir michael , is a day wherein the fortune of ten thousand men must bide the touch , for , sir , at shrewsbury , as i am truly given to understand , the king with mighty and power meets with lord harry and , i fear , sir michael , what with the sickness of northumberland , whose power was in the first proportion , and what with owen glendower absence thence , who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in , by prophecies , i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king .
why , my good lord , you need not fear , there is douglas and lord mortimer .
no , mortimer is not there .
but there is mordake , vernon , lord harry percy , and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors , noble gentlemen .
and so there is but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales , lord john of lancaster , the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt , and moe corrivals and dear men of estimation and command in arms .
doubt not , my lord , they shall be well opposed .
i hope no less , yet needful is to fear , and , to prevent the worst , sir michael , speed for if lord percy thrive not , ere the king dismiss his power , he means to visit us , for he hath heard of our confederacy , and is but wisdom to make strong against him therefore make haste .
i must go write again to other friends , and so farewell , sir michael .
exeunt act v scene i .
king henry iv camp near shrewsbury .
enter king henry , prince henry , lord john of lancaster , earl of westmoreland , sir walter blunt , and falstaff how bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon busky hill !
the day looks pale at his distemperature .
the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes , and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blustering day .
then with the losers let it sympathize , for nothing can seem foul to those that win .
the trumpet sounds enter worcester and vernon how now , my lord of worcester !
is not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet .
you have deceived our trust , and made us doff our easy robes of peace , to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel this is not well , my lord , this is not well .
what say you to it ?
will you again unknit this curlish knot of war ?
and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light , and be no more an exhaled meteor , a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times ?
hear me , my liege for mine own part , i could be well content to entertain the of my life with quiet hours , for i do protest , i have not sought the day of this dislike .
you have not sought it !
how comes it , then ?
rebellion lay in his way , and he found it .
peace , chewet , peace !
it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favour from myself and all our house , and yet i must remember you , my lord , we were the first and dearest of your friends .
for you my staff of office did i break in richard time , and posted day and night to meet you on the way , and kiss your hand , when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i .
it was myself , my brother and his son , that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time .
you swore to us , and you did swear that oath at doncaster , that you did nothing purpose the state , nor claim no further than your right , the seat of gaunt , dukedom of lancaster to this we swore our aid .
but in short space it rain down fortune showering on your head , and such a flood of greatness fell on you , what with our help , what with the absent king , what with the injuries of a wanton time , the seeming sufferances that you had borne , and the contrarious winds that held the king so long in his unlucky irish wars that all in england did repute him dead and from this swarm of fair advantages you took occasion to be quickly woo to gripe the general sway into your hand , forget your oath to us at doncaster , and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle hull , the cuckoo bird , useth the sparrow , did oppress our nest , grew by our feeding to so great a bulk that even our love durst not come near your sight for fear of swallowing , but with nimble wing we were enforced , for safety sake , to fly out of sight and raise this present head , whereby we stand opposed by such means as you yourself have forged against yourself by unkind usage , dangerous countenance , and violation of all faith and troth sworn to us in your younger enterprise .
these things indeed you have articulate , proclaim at , read in churches , to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents , which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such to impaint his cause , nor moody beggars , starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion .
in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter , if once they join in trial .
tell your nephew , the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes , this present enterprise set off his head , i do not think a braver gentleman , more or more , more daring or more bold , is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds .
for my part , i may speak it to my shame , i have a truant been to chivalry , and so i hear he doth account me too , yet this before my father majesty i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation , and will , to save the blood on either side , try fortune with him in a single fight .
and , prince of wales , so dare we venture thee , albeit considerations infinite do make against it .
no , good worcester , no , we love our people well , even those we love that are misled upon your cousin part , and , will they take the offer of our grace , both he and they and you , every man shall be my friend again and i be his so tell your cousin , and bring me word what he will do but if he will not yield , rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office .
so , be gone , we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair , take it advisedly .
exeunt worcester and vernon it will not be accepted , on my life the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms .
hence , therefore , every leader to his charge , for , on their answer , will we set on them and god befriend us , as our cause is just !
exeunt all but prince henry and falstaff hal , if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me , so , is a point of friendship .
nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship .
say thy prayers , and farewell .
i would , hal , and all well .
why , thou owest god a death .
exit prince henry is not due yet , i would be loath to pay him before his day .
what need i be so forward with him that calls not on me ?
well , is no matter , honour pricks me on .
yea , but how if honour prick me off when i come on ?
how then ?
can honour set to a leg ?
no or an arm ?
no or take away the grief of a wound ?
no .
honour hath no skill in surgery , then ?
no .
what is honour ?
a word .
what is in that word honour ?
what is that honour ?
air .
a trim reckoning !
who hath it ?
he that died o ' wednesday .
doth he feel it ?
no .
doth he hear it ?
no .
is insensible , then .
yea , to the dead .
but will it not live with the living ?
no .
why ?
detraction will not suffer it .
therefore i none of it .
honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism .
exit scene ii .
the rebel camp .
enter worcester and vernon o , no , my nephew must not know , sir richard , the liberal and kind offer of the king .
best he did .
then are we all undone .
it is not possible , it can not be , the king should keep his word in loving us , he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offence in other faults suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes , for treason is but trusted like the fox , who , so tame , so cherish and lock up , will have a wild trick of his ancestors .
look how we can , or sad or merrily , interpretation will misquote our looks , and we shall feed like oxen at a stall , the better cherish , still the nearer death .
my nephew trespass may be well forgot , it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood , and an adopted name of privilege , a hotspur , govern by a spleen all his offences live upon my head and on his father , we did train him on , and , his corruption being from us , we , as the spring of all , shall pay for all .
therefore , good cousin , let not harry know , in any case , the offer of the king .
deliver what you will , i say is so .
here comes your cousin .
enter hotspur and douglas my uncle is return deliver up my lord of westmoreland .
uncle , what news ?
the king will bid you battle presently .
defy him by the lord of westmoreland .
lord douglas , go you and tell him so .
marry , and shall , and very willingly .
exit there is no seeming mercy in the king .
did you beg any ?
god forbid !
i told him gently of our grievances , of his , which he mended thus , by now forswearing that he is forsworn he calls us rebels , traitors , and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us .
the earl of douglas arm , gentlemen , to arms !
for i have thrown a brave defiance in king henry teeth , and westmoreland , that was engaged , did bear it , which can not choose but bring him quickly on .
the prince of wales stepp forth before the king , and , nephew , challenged you to single fight .
o , would the quarrel lay upon our heads , and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth !
tell me , tell me , how show his tasking ?
seem it in contempt ?
no , by my soul , i never in my life did hear a challenge urged more modestly , unless a brother should a brother dare to gentle exercise and proof of arms .
he gave you all the duties of a man , trimm up your praises with a princely tongue , spoke to your deservings like a chronicle , making you ever better than his praise by still dispraising praise valued in you , and , which became him like a prince indeed , he made a blushing cital of himself , and chid his truant youth with such a grace as if he master there a double spirit .
of teaching and of learning instantly .
there did he pause but let me tell the world , if he outlive the envy of this day , england did never owe so sweet a hope , so much misconstrued in his wantonness .
cousin , i think thou art enamoured on his follies never did i hear of any prince so wild a libertine .
but be he as he will , yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldier arm , that he shall shrink under my courtesy .
arm , arm with speed and , fellows , soldiers , friends , better consider what you have to do than i , that have not well the gift of tongue , can lift your blood up with persuasion .
enter a messenger my lord , here are letters for you .
i can not read them now .
o gentlemen , the time of life is short !
to spend that shortness basely were too long , if life did ride upon a dial point , still ending at the arrival of an hour .
an if we live , we live to tread on kings , if die , brave death , when princes die with us !
now , for our consciences , the arms are fair , when the intent of bearing them is just .
enter another messenger my lord , prepare , the king comes on apace .
i thank him , that he cuts me from my tale , for i profess not talking , only this let each man do his best and here draw i a sword , whose temper i intend to stain with the best blood that i can meet withal in the adventure of this perilous day .
now , esperance !
percy !
and set on .
sound all the lofty instruments of war , and by that music let us all embrace , for , heaven to earth , some of us never shall a second time do such a courtesy .

what honour dost thou seek upon my head ?
know then , my name is douglas , and i do haunt thee in the battle thus because some tell me that thou art a king .
they tell thee true .
the lord of stafford dear hath bought thy likeness , for instead of thee , king harry , this sword hath ended him so shall it thee , unless thou yield thee as my prisoner .
i was not born a yielder , thou proud scot , and thou shalt find a king that will revenge lord stafford death .
they fight .
douglas kills sir walter blunt .

but who comes here ?
enter prince henry what , thou idle here ?
lend me thy sword many a nobleman lies stark and stiff under the hoofs of vaunting enemies , whose deaths are yet unrevenged i prithee , lend me thy sword .
o hal , i prithee , give me leave to breathe awhile .
turk gregory never did such deeds in arms as i have done this day .
i have paid percy , i have made him sure .
he is , indeed , and living to kill thee .
i prithee , lend me thy sword .
nay , before god , hal , if percy be alive , thou not my sword , but take my pistol , if thou wilt .
give it to me what , is it in the case ?
ay , hal , is hot , is hot , there that will sack a city .
prince henry draws it out , and finds it to be a bottle of sack what , is it a time to jest and dally now ?
he throws the bottle at him .
exit well , if percy be alive , i pierce him .
if he do come in my way , so if he do not , if i come in his willingly , let him make a carbonado of me .

i will do so .

come , my lord , i lead you to your tent .
lead me , my lord ?
i do not need your help and god forbid a shallow scratch should drive the prince of wales from such a field as this , where stain nobility lies trodden on , and rebels ' arms triumph in massacres !

exeunt lancaster and westmoreland by god , thou hast deceived me , lancaster , i did not think thee lord of such a spirit before , i loved thee as a brother , john , but now , i do respect thee as my soul .

i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but , seeing thou on me so luckily , i will assay thee so , defend thyself .

stay , and breathe awhile thou hast redeem thy lost opinion , and show thou makest some tender of my life , in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me .
o god !
they did me too much injury that ever said i hearken for your death .

my name is harry percy .
why , then i see a very valiant rebel of the name .
i am the prince of wales , and think not , percy , to share with me in glory any more two stars keep not their motion in one sphere , nor can one england brook a double reign , of harry percy and the prince of wales .
nor shall it , harry , for the hour is come to end the one of us , and would to god thy name in arms were now as great as mine !
i make it greater ere i part from thee , and all the budding honours on thy crest i crop , to make a garland for my head .
i can no longer brook thy vanities .

hotspur is wounded , and falls o , harry , thou hast robb me of my youth !
i better brook the loss of brittle life than those proud titles thou hast won of me , they wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh but thought the slave of life , and life time fool , and time , that takes survey of all the world , must have a stop .
o , i could prophesy , but that the earthy and cold hand of death lies on my tongue no , percy , thou art dust and food for dies for worms , brave percy fare thee well , great heart !
ambition , how much art thou shrunk !
when that this body did contain a spirit , a kingdom for it was too small a bound , but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough this earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so stout a gentleman .
if thou wert sensible of courtesy , i should not make so dear a show of zeal but let my favours hide thy mangled face , and , even in thy behalf , i thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness .
adieu , and take thy praise with thee to heaven !
thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave , but not remember in thy epitaph !

could not all this flesh keep in a little life ?
poor jack , farewell !
i could have better spared a better man o , i should have a heavy miss of thee , if i were much in love with vanity !
death hath not struck so fat a deer , though many dearer , in this bloody fray .
embowell will i see thee by and by till then in blood by noble percy lie .

if thou embowel me , i give you leave to powder me and eat me too .

counterfeit ?
i lie , i am no counterfeit to die , is to be a counterfeit , for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying , when a man thereby liveth , is to be no counterfeit , but the true and perfect image of life indeed .
the better part of valour is discretion , in the which better part i have saved my life .
, i am afraid of this gunpowder percy , though he be dead how , if he should counterfeit too and rise ?
by my faith , i am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit .
therefore i make him sure , yea , and i swear i killed him .
why may not he rise as well as i ?
nothing confutes me but eyes , and nobody sees me .
therefore , sirrah , stabbing him with a new wound in your thigh , come you along with me .

but , soft !
whom have we here ?
did you not tell me this fat man was dead ?
i did , i saw him dead , breathless and bleeding on the ground .
art thou alive ?
or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight ?
i prithee , speak , we will not trust our eyes without our ears thou art not what thou .
no , that certain , i am not a double man but if i be not jack falstaff , then am i a jack .
there is percy throwing the body down if your father will do me any honour , so , if not , let him kill the next percy himself .
i look to be either earl or duke , i can assure you .
why , percy i killed myself and saw thee dead .
didst thou ?
lord , lord , how this world is given to lying !
i grant you i was down and out of breath , and so was he but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock .
if i may be believed , so , if not , let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads .
i take it upon my death , i gave him this wound in the thigh if the man were alive and would deny it , , i would make him eat a piece of my sword .
this is the strangest tale that ever i heard .
this is the strangest fellow , brother john .
come , bring your luggage nobly on your back for my part , if a lie may do thee grace , i gild it with the happiest terms i have .
a retreat is sounded the trumpet sounds retreat , the day is ours .
come , brother , let us to the highest of the field , to see what friends are living , who are dead .
exeunt prince henry and lancaster i follow , as they say , for reward .
he that rewards me , god reward him !
if i do grow great , i grow less , for i purge , and leave sack , and live cleanly as a nobleman should do .
exit scene another part of the field .
the trumpets sound .
enter king henry iv , prince henry , lord john lancaster , earl of westmoreland , with worcester and vernon prisoners thus ever did rebellion find rebuke .
worcester !
did not we send grace , pardon and terms of love to all of you ?
and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary ?
misuse the tenor of thy kinsman trust ?
three knights upon our party slain , a noble earl and many a creature else had been alive this hour , if like a christian thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies true intelligence .
what i have done my safety urged me to , and i embrace this fortune patiently , since not to be avoided it falls on me .
bear worcester to the death and vernon too other offenders we will pause upon .
exeunt worcester and vernon , guarded how goes the field ?
the noble scot , lord douglas , when he saw the fortune of the day quite turn from him , the noble percy slain , and all his men upon the foot of fear , fled with the rest , and falling from a hill , he was so bruised that the pursuers took him .
at my tent the douglas is , and i beseech your grace i may dispose of him .
with all my heart .
then , brother john of lancaster , to you this honourable bounty shall belong go to the douglas , and deliver him up to his pleasure , ransomless and free his valour shown upon our crests hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds even in the bosom of our adversaries .
i thank your grace for this high courtesy , which i shall give away immediately .
then this remains , that we divide our power .
you , son john , and my cousin westmoreland towards york shall bend you with your dearest speed , to meet northumberland and the prelate scroop , who , as we hear , are busily in arms myself and you , son harry , will towards wales , to fight with glendower and the earl of march .
rebellion in this land shall lose his sway , meeting the cheque of such another day and since this business so fair is done , let us not leave till all our own be won .
exeunt act i scene westminster abbey .
dead march .
enter the funeral of king henry the fifth , attended on by dukes of bedford , regent of france , gloucester , protector , and exeter , earl of warwick , the bishop of winchester , heralds , and c hung be the heavens with black , yield day to night !
comets , importing change of times and states , brandish your crystal tresses in the sky , and with them scourge the bad revolting stars that have consented unto henry death !
king henry the fifth , too famous to live long !
england lost a king of so much worth .
england had a king until his time .
virtue he had , deserving to command his brandish sword did blind men with his beams his arms spread wider than a dragon wings , his sparking eyes , replete with wrathful fire , more dazzled and drove back his enemies than sun fierce bent against their faces .
what should i say ?
his deeds exceed all speech he lift up his hand but conquered .
we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood ?
henry is dead and never shall revive upon a wooden coffin we attend , and death dishonourable victory we with our stately presence glorify , like captives bound to a triumphant car .
what !
shall we curse the planets of mishap that plotted thus our glory overthrow ?
or shall we think the french conjurers and sorcerers , that afraid of him by magic verses have contrived his end ?
bishop he was a king bless of the king of kings .
unto the french the dreadful so dreadful will not be as was his sight .
the battles of the lord of hosts he fought the church prayers made him so prosperous .
the church !
where is it ?
had not churchmen pray , his thread of life had not so soon decay none do you like but an effeminate prince , whom , like a , you may .
bishop gloucester , we like , thou art protector and lookest to command the prince and realm .
thy wife is proud , she holdeth thee in awe , more than god or religious churchmen may .
name not religion , for thou lovest the flesh , and throughout the year to church thou except it be to pray against thy foes .
cease , cease these jars and rest your minds in peace let to the altar heralds , wait on us instead of gold , we offer up our arms since arms avail not now that henry dead .
posterity , await for wretched years , when at their mothers ' moist eyes babes shall suck , our isle be made a nourish of salt tears , and none but women left to wail the dead .
henry the fifth , thy ghost i invocate prosper this realm , keep it from civil broils , combat with adverse planets in the heavens !
a far more glorious star thy soul will make than julius caesar or bright enter a messenger my honourable lords , health to you all !
sad tidings bring i to you out of france , of loss , of slaughter and discomfiture guienne , champagne , rheims , orleans , paris , guysors , poictiers , are all quite lost .
what thou , man , before dead henry corse ?
speak softly , or the loss of those great towns will make him burst his lead and rise from death .
is paris lost ?
is rouen yielded up ?
if henry were recall to life again , these news would cause him once more yield the ghost .
how were they lost ?
what treachery was used ?
no treachery , but want of men and money .
amongst the soldiers this is muttered , that here you maintain several factions , and whilst a field should be dispatch and fought , you are disputing of your generals one would have lingering wars with little cost , another would fly swift , but wanteth wings , a third thinks , without expense at all , by guileful fair words peace may be obtain .
awake , awake , english nobility !
let not sloth dim your horrors cropp are the in your arms , of england coat one half is cut away .
were our tears wanting to this funeral , these tidings would call forth their flowing tides .
me they concern , regent i am of france .
give me my steeled coat .
i fight for france .
away with these disgraceful wailing robes !
wounds will i lend the french instead of eyes , to weep their intermissive miseries .
enter to them another messenger lords , view these letters full of bad mischance .
france is revolted from the english quite , except some petty towns of no import the dauphin charles is crowned king of rheims , the bastard of orleans with him is join , reignier , duke of anjou , doth take his part , the duke of alencon flieth to his side .
the dauphin crowned king !
all fly to him !
o , whither shall we fly from this reproach ?
we will not fly , but to our enemies ' throats .
bedford , if thou be slack , i fight it out .
gloucester , why thou of my forwardness ?
an army have i muster in my thoughts , wherewith already france is overrun .
enter another messenger my gracious lords , to add to your laments , wherewith you now bedew king henry hearse , i must inform you of a dismal fight betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french .
bishop what !
wherein talbot overcame ?
so ?
o , no , wherein lord talbot was the circumstance i tell you more at large .
the tenth of august last this dreadful lord , retiring from the siege of orleans , having full scarce six thousand in his troop .
by three and twenty thousand of the french was round encompassed and set upon .
no leisure had he to enrank his men , he wanted pikes to set before his archers , instead whereof sharp stakes pluck out of hedges they pitched in the ground confusedly , to keep the horsemen off from breaking in .
more than three hours the fight continued , where valiant talbot above human thought enacted wonders with his sword and lance hundreds he sent to hell , and none durst stand him , here , there , and every where , enraged he flew the french exclaim , the devil was in arms , all the whole army stood agazed on him his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit a talbot !
a talbot !
cried out amain and rush into the bowels of the battle .
here had the conquest fully been seal up , if sir john fastolfe had not play the coward he , being in the vaward , placed behind with purpose to relieve and follow them , cowardly fled , not having struck one stroke .
hence grew the general wreck and massacre , enclosed were they with their enemies a base walloon , to win the dauphin grace , thrust talbot with a spear into the back , whom all france with their chief assembled strength durst not presume to look once in the face .
is talbot slain ?
then i will slay myself , for living idly here in pomp and ease , whilst such a worthy leader , wanting aid , unto his dastard foemen is betray .
o no , he lives , but is took prisoner , and lord scales with him and lord hungerford most of the rest slaughter or took likewise .
his ransom there is none but i shall pay i hale the dauphin headlong from his throne his crown shall be the ransom of my friend , four of their lords i change for one of ours .
farewell , my masters , to my task will i , bonfires in france forthwith i am to make , to keep our great saint george feast withal ten thousand soldiers with me i will take , whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake .
so you had need , for orleans is besieged , the english army is grown weak and faint the earl of salisbury craveth supply , and hardly keeps his men from mutiny , since they , so few , watch such a multitude .
remember , lords , your oaths to henry sworn , either to quell the dauphin utterly , or bring him in obedience to your yoke .
i do remember it , and here take my leave , to go about my preparation .
exit i to the tower with all the haste i can , to view the artillery and munition , and then i will proclaim young henry king .
exit to eltham will i , where the young king is , being ordain his special governor , and for his safety there i best devise .
exit bishop each hath his place and function to attend i am left out , for me nothing remains .
but long i will not be jack out of office the king from eltham i intend to steal and sit at chiefest stern of public weal .
exeunt scene ii .
france .
before orleans .
sound a flourish .
enter charles , alencon , and reignier , marching with drum and soldiers mars his true moving , even as in the heavens so in the earth , to this day is not known late did he shine upon the english side , now we are victors , upon us he smiles .
what towns of any moment but we have ?
at pleasure here we lie near orleans , otherwhiles the famish english , like pale ghosts , faintly besiege us one hour in a month .
they want their porridge and their fat either they must be dieted like mules and have their provender tied to their mouths or piteous they will look , like drowned mice .
let raise the siege why live we idly here ?
talbot is taken , whom we wont to fear remaineth none but salisbury , and he may well in fretting spend his gall , nor men nor money hath he to make war .
sound , sound alarum !
we will rush on them .
now for the honour of the forlorn french !
him i forgive my death that killeth me when he sees me go back one foot or fly .
exeunt here alarum , they are beaten back by the english with great loss .
charles , alencon , and reignier who ever saw the like ?
what men have i !
dogs !
cowards !
dastards !
i would have fled , but that they left me my enemies .
salisbury is a desperate homicide , he fighteth as one weary of his life .
the other lords , like lions wanting food , do rush upon us as their hungry prey .
froissart , a countryman of ours , records , england all olivers and rowlands bred , during the time edward the third did reign .
more truly now may this be verified , for none but samsons and goliases it sendeth forth to skirmish .
one to ten !
lean , rascals !
who would suppose they had such courage and audacity ?
let leave this town , for they are slaves , and hunger will enforce them to be more eager of old i know them , rather with their teeth the walls they tear down than forsake the siege .
i think , by some odd gimmors or device their arms are set like clocks , stiff to strike on , else could they hold out so as they do .
by my consent , we even let them alone .
be it so .
enter the bastard of orleans where the prince dauphin ?
i have news for him .
bastard of orleans , thrice welcome to us .
methinks your looks are sad , your cheer appall hath the late overthrow wrought this offence ?
be not dismay , for succor is at hand a holy maid hither with me i bring , which by a vision sent to her from heaven ordained is to raise this tedious siege and drive the english forth the bounds of france .
the spirit of deep prophecy she hath , exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome what past and what to come she can descry .
speak , shall i call her in ?
believe my words , for they are certain and unfallible .
go , call her in .
exit bastard of orleans but first , to try her skill , reignier , stand thou as dauphin in my place question her proudly , let thy looks be stern by this means shall we sound what skill she hath .
the bastard of orleans , with joan la pucelle fair maid , thou wilt do these wondrous feats ?
reignier , thou that thinkest to beguile me ?
where is the dauphin ?
come , come from behind , i know thee well , though never seen before .
be not amazed , there nothing hid from me in private will i talk with thee apart .
stand back , you lords , and give us leave awhile .
she takes upon her bravely at first dash .
dauphin , i am by birth a shepherd daughter , my wit untrain in any kind of art .
heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased to shine on my contemptible estate lo , whilst i waited on my tender lambs , and to sun parching heat display my cheeks , god mother deigned to appear to me and in a vision full of majesty will me to leave my base vocation and free my country from calamity her aid she promised and assured success in complete glory she reveal herself , and , whereas i was black and swart before , with those clear rays which she infused on me that beauty am i bless with which you see .
ask me what question thou canst possible , and i will answer unpremeditated my courage try by combat , if thou darest , and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex .
resolve on this , thou shalt be fortunate , if thou receive me for thy warlike mate .
thou hast astonish me with thy high terms only this proof i of thy valour make , in single combat thou shalt buckle with me , and if thou vanquishest , thy words are true , otherwise i renounce all confidence .
i am prepared here is my sword , deck with five on each side , the which at touraine , in saint katharine churchyard , out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth .
then come , o ' god name , i fear no woman .
and while i live , i fly from a man .
here they fight , and joan la pucelle overcomes stay , stay thy hands !
thou art an amazon and fightest with the sword of deborah .
christ mother helps me , else i were too weak .
helps thee , is thou that must help me impatiently i burn with thy desire , my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued .
excellent pucelle , if thy name be so , let me thy servant and not sovereign be is the french dauphin sueth to thee thus .
i must not yield to any rites of love , for my profession sacred from above when i have chased all thy foes from hence , then will i think upon a recompense .
meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall .
my lord , methinks , is very long in talk .
doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock , else could he so long protract his speech .
shall we disturb him , since he keeps no mean ?
he may mean more than we poor men do know these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues .
my lord , where are you ?
what devise you on ?
shall we give over orleans , or no ?
why , no , i say , distrustful recreants !
fight till the last gasp , i will be your guard .
what she says i confirm we fight it out .
assign am i to be the english scourge .
this night the siege assuredly i raise expect saint martin summer , halcyon days , since i have entered into these wars .
glory is like a circle in the water , which never ceaseth to enlarge itself till by broad spreading it disperse to nought .
with henry death the english circle ends , dispersed are the glories it included .
now am i like that proud insulting ship which caesar and his fortune bare at once .
was mahomet inspired with a dove ?
thou with an eagle art inspired then .
helen , the mother of great constantine , nor yet saint philip daughters , were like thee .
bright star of venus , down on the earth , how may i reverently worship thee enough ?
leave off delays , and let us raise the siege .
woman , do what thou canst to save our honours , drive them from orleans and be immortalized .
presently we try come , let away about it no prophet will i trust , if she prove false .

before the tower .
enter gloucester , with his in blue coats i am come to survey the tower this day since henry death , i fear , there is conveyance .
where be these warders , that they wait not here ?

who willed you ?
or whose will stands but mine ?

break up the gates , i be your warrantize .
shall i be flouted thus by dunghill grooms ?
gloucester men rush at the tower gates , and woodvile the lieutenant speaks within what noise is this ?
what traitors have we here ?
lieutenant , is it you whose voice i hear ?
open the gates , here gloucester that would enter .
have patience , noble duke , i may not open , the cardinal of winchester forbids from him i have express commandment that thou nor none of thine shall be let in .
woodvile , prizest him me ?
arrogant winchester , that haughty prelate , whom henry , our late sovereign , could brook ?
thou art no friend to god or to the king open the gates , or i shut thee out shortly .
open the gates unto the lord protector , or we burst them open , if that you come not quickly .
enter to the protector at the tower gates bishop of winchester and his men in tawny coats bishop how now , ambitious humphry !
what means this ?
peel priest , dost thou command me to be shut out ?
bishop i do , thou most usurping proditor , and not protector , of the king or realm .

bishop nay , stand thou back , i will not budge a foot this be damascus , be thou cursed cain , to slay thy brother abel , if thou wilt .
i will not slay thee , but i drive thee back thy scarlet robes as a child i use to carry thee out of this place .
bishop do what thou darest , i beard thee to thy face .

am i dared and bearded to my face ?
draw , men , for all this privileged place , blue coats to tawny coats .
priest , beware your beard , i mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly under my feet i stamp thy cardinal hat in spite of pope or dignities of church , here by the cheeks i drag thee up and down .
bishop gloucester , thou wilt answer this before the pope .
winchester goose , i cry , a rope !
a rope !
now beat them hence , why do you let them stay ?
thee i chase hence , thou wolf in sheep array .
out , tawny coats !

here gloucester men beat out bishop of winchester men , and enter in the burly the mayor of london and his officers fie , lords !
that you , being supreme magistrates , thus contumeliously should break the peace !
peace , mayor !
thou little of my wrongs here beaufort , that regards nor god nor king , hath here distrain the tower to his use .
bishop here gloucester , a foe to citizens , one that still motions war and never peace , your free purses with large fines , that seeks to overthrow religion , because he is protector of the realm , and would have armour here out of the tower , to crown himself king and suppress the prince .
i will not answer thee with words , but blows .
here they skirmish again naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife but to make open proclamation come , officer , as loud as thou canst , cry .
all manner of men assembled here in arms this day against god peace and the king , we charge and command you , in his highness ' name , to repair to your several , and not to wear , handle , or use any sword , weapon , or dagger , henceforward , upon pain of death .
cardinal , i be no breaker of the law but we shall meet , and break our minds at large .
bishop gloucester , we will meet , to thy cost , be sure thy i will have for this day work .
i call for clubs , if you will not away .

enter , on the walls , a master gunner and his boy sirrah , thou how orleans is besieged , and how the english have the suburbs won .
father , i know , and oft have shot at them , unfortunate i miss my aim .
but now thou shalt not .
be thou ruled by me chief am i of this town , something i must do to procure me grace .
the prince espials have informed me how the english , in the suburbs close intrench , wont , through a secret grate of iron bars in yonder tower , to overpeer the city , and thence discover how with most advantage they may vex us with shot , or with assault .
to intercept this inconvenience , a piece of ordnance it i have placed , and even these three days have i watch , if i could see them .
now do thou watch , for i can stay no longer .
if thou any , run and bring me word , and thou shalt find me at the governor .
exit father , i warrant you , take you no care , i never trouble you , if i may spy them .
exit enter , on the turrets , salisbury and talbot , glansdale , gargrave , and others talbot , my life , my joy , again return !
how wert thou handled being prisoner ?
or by what means thou to be released ?
discourse , i prithee , on this turret top .
the duke of bedford had a prisoner call the brave lord ponton de santrailles , for him was i exchanged and ransomed .
but with a baser man of arms by far once in contempt they would have barter me which i , disdaining , scorn , and craved death , rather than i would be so vile esteem .
in fine , redeem i was as i desired .
but , o !
the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart , whom with my bare fists i would execute , if i now had him brought into my power .
yet thou not how thou wert entertain .
with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts .
in open produced they me , to be a public spectacle to all here , said they , is the terror of the french , the scarecrow that affrights our children so .
then broke i from the officers that led me , and with my nails digg stones out of the ground , to hurl at the beholders of my shame my grisly countenance made others fly , none durst come near for fear of sudden death .
in iron walls they deem me not secure , so great fear of my name them was spread , that they supposed i could rend bars of steel , and spurn in pieces posts of adamant wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had , that walked about me every , and if i did but stir out of my bed , ready they were to shoot me to the heart .
enter the boy with a linstock i grieve to hear what torments you endured , but we will be revenged sufficiently now it is in orleans here , through this grate , i count each one and view the frenchmen how they fortify let us look in , the sight will much delight thee .
sir thomas gargrave , and sir william glansdale , let me have your express opinions where is best place to make our battery next .
i think , at the north gate , for there stand lords .
and i , here , at the bulwark of the bridge .
for aught i see , this city must be famish , or with light skirmishes enfeebled .
here they shoot .
salisbury and gargrave fall o lord , have mercy on us , wretched sinners !
o lord , have mercy on me , woful man !
what chance is this that suddenly hath cross us ?
speak , salisbury , at least , if thou canst speak how farest thou , mirror of all martial men ?
one of thy eyes and thy cheek side struck off !
accursed tower !
accursed fatal hand that hath contrived this woful tragedy !
in thirteen battles salisbury , henry the fifth he first train to the wars , whilst any trump did sound , or drum struck up , his sword did leave striking in the field .
yet livest thou , salisbury ?
though thy speech doth fail , one eye thou hast , to look to heaven for grace the sun with one eye vieweth all the world .
heaven , be thou gracious to none alive , if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands !
bear hence his body , i will help to bury it .
sir thomas gargrave , hast thou any life ?
speak unto talbot , nay , look up to him .
salisbury , cheer thy spirit with this comfort , thou shalt not die whiles he beckons with his hand and smiles on me .
as who should say i am dead and gone , remember to avenge me on the french . '
plantagenet , i will , and like thee , nero , play on the lute , beholding the towns burn wretched shall france be only in my name .
here an alarum , and it thunders and lightens what stir is this ?
what tumult in the heavens ?
whence cometh this alarum and the noise ?

it irks his heart he can not be revenged .
frenchmen , i be a salisbury to you pucelle or puzzel , dolphin or dogfish , your hearts i stamp out with my horse heels , and make a quagmire of your mingled brains .

my breast i burst with straining of my courage and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder .
but i will chastise this strumpet .

a short alarum , then enter the town with soldiers me , if thou canst , i scorn thy strength .
go , go , cheer up thy men , help salisbury to make his testament this day is ours , as many more shall be .
exit my thoughts are whirled like a potter wheel , i know not where i am , nor what i do , a witch , by fear , not force , like hannibal , drives back our troops and conquers as she lists so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench are from their hives and houses driven away .
they call us for our fierceness english dogs , now , like to whelps , we crying run away .
a short alarum hark , countrymen !
either renew the fight , or tear the lions out of england coat , renounce your soil , give sheep in lions ' stead sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf , or horse or oxen from the leopard , as you fly from your slaves .

of all exploits since first i follow arms , heard i of a warlike enterprise more venturous or desperate than this .
i think this talbot be a fiend of hell .
if not of hell , the heavens , sure , favour him .
here cometh charles i marvel how he sped .
tut , holy joan was his defensive guard .
enter charles and joan la pucelle is this thy cunning , thou deceitful dame ?
didst thou at first , to flatter us withal , make us partakers of a little gain , that now our loss might be ten times so much ?
wherefore is charles impatient with his friend !
at all times will you have my power alike ?
sleeping or waking must i still prevail , or will you blame and lay the fault on me ?
improvident soldiers !
had your watch been good , this sudden mischief never could have .
duke of alencon , this was your default , that , being captain of the watch , did look no better to that weighty charge .
had all your quarters been as safely kept as that whereof i had the government , we had not been thus shamefully surprised .
mine was secure .
and so was mine , my lord .
and , for myself , most part of all this night , within her quarter and mine own precinct i was employ in passing to and fro , about relieving of the sentinels then how or which way should they first break in ?
question , my lords , no further of the case , how or which way is sure they found some place but weakly guarded , where the breach was made .
and now there rests no other shift but this , to gather our soldiers , scatter and dispersed , and lay new platforms to endamage them .
alarum .
enter an english soldier , crying ' a talbot !
a talbot ! '
they fly , leaving their clothes behind i be so bold to take what they have left .
the cry of talbot serves me for a sword , for i have loaden me with many spoils , using no other weapon but his name .
exit scene ii .

enter talbot , bedford , burgundy , a captain , and others the day begins to break , and night is fled , whose pitchy mantle the earth .
here sound retreat , and cease our hot pursuit .
retreat sounded bring forth the body of old salisbury , and here advance it in the , the middle centre of this cursed town .
now have i paid my vow unto his soul , for every drop of blood was drawn from him , there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight .
and that hereafter ages may behold what ruin happen in revenge of him , within their chiefest temple i erect a tomb , wherein his corpse shall be interr upon the which , that every one may read , shall be engraved the sack of orleans , the treacherous manner of his mournful death and what a terror he had been to france .
but , lords , in all our bloody massacre , i muse we met not with the dauphin grace , his champion , virtuous joan of arc , nor any of his false confederates .
is thought , lord talbot , when the fight began , roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds , they did amongst the troops of armed men leap the walls for refuge in the field .
myself , as far as i could well discern for smoke and dusky vapours of the night , am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull , when arm in arm they both came swiftly running , like to a pair of loving that could not live asunder day or night .
after that things are set in order here , we follow them with all the power we have .
enter a messenger all hail , my lords !
which of this princely train call ye the warlike talbot , for his acts so much applauded through the realm of france ?
here is the talbot who would speak with him ?
the virtuous lady , countess of auvergne , with modesty admiring thy renown , by me entreats , great lord , thou wouldst vouchsafe to visit her poor castle where she lies , that she may boast she hath beheld the man whose glory fills the world with loud report .
is it even so ?
nay , then , i see our wars will turn unto a peaceful comic sport , when ladies crave to be encounter with .
you may not , my lord , despise her gentle suit .
trust me then , for when a world of men could not prevail with all their oratory , yet hath a woman kindness and therefore tell her i return great thanks , and in submission will attend on her .
will not your honours bear me company ?
no , truly , it is more than manners will and i have heard it said , unbidden guests are often welcomest when they are gone .
well then , alone , since there no remedy , i mean to prove this lady courtesy .
come hither , captain .
whispers you perceive my mind ?
i do , my lord , and mean accordingly .

madam , i will .
exit countess the plot is laid if all things fall out right , i shall as famous be by this exploit as scythian tomyris by cyrus ' death .
great is the rumor of this dreadful knight , and his achievements of no less account fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears , to give their censure of these rare reports .
enter messenger and talbot madam , according as your ladyship desired , by message craved , so is lord talbot come .
countess and he is welcome .
what !
is this the man ?
madam , it is .
countess is this the scourge of france ?
is this the talbot , so much fear abroad that with his name the mothers still their babes ?
i see report is fabulous and false i thought i should have seen some hercules , a second hector , for his grim aspect , and large proportion of his limbs .
alas , this is a child , a silly dwarf !
it can not be this weak and writhled shrimp should strike such terror to his enemies .
madam , i have been bold to trouble you , but since your ladyship is not at leisure , i sort some other time to visit you .
countess what means he now ?
go ask him whither he goes .
stay , my lord talbot , for my lady craves to know the cause of your abrupt departure .
marry , for that she in a wrong belief , i go to certify her talbot here .
porter with keys countess if thou be he , then art thou prisoner .
prisoner !
to whom ?
countess to me , lord , and for that cause i trained thee to my house .
long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me , for in my gallery thy picture hangs but now the substance shall endure the like , and i will chain these legs and arms of thine , that hast by tyranny these many years wasted our country , slain our citizens and sent our sons and husbands captivate .
ha , ha , ha !
countess laughest thou , wretch ?
thy mirth shall turn to moan .
i laugh to see your ladyship so fond to think that you have aught but talbot shadow whereon to practise your severity .
countess why , art not thou the man ?
i am indeed .
countess then have i substance too .
no , no , i am but shadow of myself you are deceived , my substance is not here , for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity i tell you , madam , were the whole frame here , it is of such a spacious lofty pitch , your roof were not sufficient to contai .
countess this is a riddling merchant for the nonce , he will be here , and yet he is not here how can these contrarieties agree ?
that will i show you presently .
winds his horn .
drums strike up a peal of ordnance .
enter soldiers how say you , madam ?
are you now persuaded that talbot is but shadow of himself ?
these are his substance , sinews , arms and strength , with which he yoketh your rebellious necks , razeth your cities and subverts your towns and in a moment makes them desolate .
countess victorious talbot !
pardon my abuse i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited and more than may be gather by thy shape .
let my presumption not provoke thy wrath , for i am sorry that with reverence i did not entertain thee as thou art .
be not dismay , fair lady , nor misconstrue the mind of talbot , as you did mistake the outward composition of his body .
what you have done hath not offended me , nor other satisfaction do i crave , but only , with your patience , that we may taste of your wine and see what cates you have , for soldiers ' stomachs always serve them well .
countess with all my heart , and think me honoured to feast so great a warrior in my house .

enter the earls of somerset , suffolk , and warwick , richard plantagenet , vernon , and another lawyer richard great lords and gentlemen , what means this silence ?
dare no man answer in a case of truth ?
within the we were too loud , the garden here is more convenient .
richard then say at once if i maintain the truth , or else was wrangling somerset in the error ?
faith , i have been a truant in the law , and never yet could frame my will to it , and therefore frame the law unto my will .
judge you , my lord of warwick , then , between us .
between two hawks , which flies the higher pitch , between two dogs , which hath the deeper mouth , between two blades , which bears the better temper between two horses , which doth bear him best , between two girls , which hath the merriest eye , i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement , but in these nice sharp quillets of the law , good faith , i am no wiser than a daw .
richard tut , tut , here is a mannerly forbearance the truth appears so naked on my side that any purblind eye may find it out .
and on my side it is so well apparell , so clear , so shining and so evident that it will glimmer through a blind man eye .
richard since you are and so loath to speak , in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts let him that is a gentleman and stands upon the honour of his birth , if he suppose that i have pleaded truth , from off this brier pluck a white rose with me .
let him that is no coward nor no flatterer , but dare maintain the party of the truth , pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me .
i love no colours , and without all colour of base insinuating flattery i pluck this white rose with plantagenet .
i pluck this red rose with young somerset and say withal i think he held the right .
stay , lords and gentlemen , and pluck no more , till you conclude that he upon whose side the fewest roses are cropp from the tree shall yield the other in the right opinion .
good master vernon , it is well objected if i have fewest , i subscribe in silence .
richard and i .
then for the truth and plainness of the case .
i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here , giving my verdict on the white rose side .
prick not your finger as you pluck it off , lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red and fall on my side so , against your will .
if i my lord , for my opinion bleed , opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt and keep me on the side where still i am .
well , well , come on who else ?
unless my study and my books be false , the argument you held was wrong in you to somerset in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too .
richard now , somerset , where is your argument ?
here in my scabbard , meditating that shall dye your white rose in a bloody red .
richard meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses , for pale they look with fear , as witnessing the truth on our side .
no , plantagenet , is not for fear but anger that thy cheeks blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses , and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error .
richard hath not thy rose a canker , somerset ?
hath not thy rose a thorn , plantagenet ?
richard ay , sharp and piercing , to maintain his truth , whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood .
well , i find friends to wear my bleeding roses , that shall maintain what i have said is true , where false plantagenet dare not be seen .
richard now , by this maiden blossom in my hand , i scorn thee and thy fashion , peevish boy .
turn not thy scorns this way , plantagenet .
richard proud pole , i will , and scorn both him and thee .
i turn my part thereof into thy throat .
away , away , good william de la pole !
we grace the yeoman by conversing with him .
now , by god will , thou him , somerset , his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence , third son to the third edward king of england spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root ?
richard he bears him on the place privilege , or durst not , for his craven heart , say thus .
by him that made me , i maintain my words on any plot of ground in christendom .
was not thy father , richard earl of cambridge , for treason executed in our late king days ?
and , by his treason , not thou attainted , corrupted , and exempt from ancient gentry ?
his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood , and , till thou be restored , thou art a yeoman .
richard my father was attached , not attainted , condemn to die for treason , but no traitor , and that i prove on better men than somerset , were growing time once ripen to my will .
for your partaker pole and you yourself , i note you in my book of memory , to scourge you for this apprehension look to it well and say you are well warn .
ah , thou shalt find us ready for thee still , and know us by these colours for thy foes , for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear .
richard and , by my soul , this pale and angry rose , as cognizance of my hate , will i for ever and my faction wear , until it wither with me to my grave or flourish to the height of my degree .
go forward and be choked with thy ambition !
and so farewell until i meet thee next .
exit have with thee , pole .
farewell , ambitious richard .
exit richard how i am braved and must perforce endure it !
this blot that they object against your house shall be wiped out in the next parliament call for the truce of winchester and gloucester , and if thou be not then created york , i will not live to be accounted warwick .
meantime , in signal of my love to thee , against proud somerset and william pole , will i upon thy party wear this rose and here i prophesy this brawl , grown to this faction in the , shall send between the red rose and the white a thousand souls to death and deadly night .
richard good master vernon , i am bound to you , that you on my behalf would pluck a flower .
in your behalf still will i wear the same .
and so will i .
richard thanks , gentle sir .
come , let us four to dinner i dare say this quarrel will drink blood another day .
exeunt scene the tower of london .
enter mortimer , brought in a chair , and gaolers kind keepers of my weak decaying age , let dying mortimer here rest himself .
even like a man new haled from the rack , so fare my limbs with long imprisonment .
and these grey locks , the pursuivants of death , aged in an age of care , argue the end of edmund mortimer .
these eyes , like lamps whose wasting oil is spent , wax dim , as drawing to their exigent , weak shoulders , overborne with burthening grief , and pithless arms , like to a wither vine that droops his sapless branches to the ground , yet are these feet , whose strengthless stay is numb , unable to support this lump of clay , with desire to get a grave , as witting i no other comfort have .
but tell me , keeper , will my nephew come ?
richard plantagenet , my lord , will come we sent unto the temple , unto his chamber , and answer was return that he will come .
enough my soul shall then be satisfied .
poor gentleman !
his wrong doth equal mine .
since henry monmouth first began to reign , before whose glory i was great in arms , this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscured , deprived of honour and inheritance .
but now the arbitrator of despairs , just death , kind umpire of men miseries , with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence i would his troubles likewise were expired , that so he might recover what was lost .
enter richard plantagenet my lord , your loving nephew now is come .
richard plantagenet , my friend , is he come ?
richard ay , noble uncle , thus ignobly used , your nephew , late despised richard , comes .
direct mine arms i may embrace his neck , and in his bosom spend my latter gasp o , tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks , that i may kindly give one fainting kiss .
and now declare , sweet stem from york great stock , why didst thou say , of late thou wert despised ?
richard first , lean thine aged back against mine arm , and , in that ease , i tell thee my disease .
this day , in argument upon a case , some words there grew somerset and me , among which terms he used his lavish tongue and did upbraid me with my father death which obloquy set bars before my tongue , else with the like i had requited him .
therefore , good uncle , for my father sake , in honour of a true plantagenet and for alliance sake , declare the cause my father , earl of cambridge , lost his head .
that cause , fair nephew , that imprison me and hath detain me all my flowering youth within a loathsome dungeon , there to pine , was cursed instrument of his decease .
richard discover more at large what cause that was , for i am ignorant and can not guess .
i will , if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done .
henry the fourth , grandfather to this king , deposed his nephew richard , edward son , the and the lawful heir , of edward king , the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north , finding his usurpation most unjust , endeavor my advancement to the throne the reason moved these warlike lords to this was , for that young king richard thus removed , leaving no heir begotten of his body i was the next by birth and parentage , for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence , the third son to king edward the third , whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree , being but fourth of that heroic line .
but mark as in this haughty attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir , i lost my liberty and they their lives .
long after this , when henry the fifth , succeeding his father bolingbroke , did reign , thy father , earl of cambridge , then derived from famous edmund langley , duke of york , marrying my sister that thy mother was , again in pity of my hard distress levied an army , weening to redeem and have install me in the diadem but , as the rest , so fell that noble earl and was beheaded .
thus the mortimers , in whom the tide rested , were suppress .
richard of which , my lord , your honour is the last .
true , and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death , thou art my heir , the rest i wish thee gather but yet be wary in thy studious care .
richard thy grave admonishments prevail with me but yet , methinks , my father execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny .
with silence , nephew , be thou politic is the house of lancaster , and like a mountain , not to be removed .
but now thy uncle is removing hence as princes do their courts , when they are cloy with long continuance in a settled place .
richard o , uncle , would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age !
thou dost then wrong me , as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill .
mourn not , except thou sorrow for my good , only give order for my funeral and so farewell , and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war !
dies richard and peace , no war , befall thy parting soul !
in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpass thy days .
well , i will lock his counsel in my breast , and what i do imagine let that rest .
keepers , convey him hence , and i myself will see his burial better than his life .
exeunt gaolers , bearing out the body of mortimer here dies the dusky torch of mortimer , choked with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs , those bitter injuries , which somerset hath offer to my house i doubt not but with honour to redress , and therefore haste i to the parliament , either to be restored to my blood , or make my ill the advantage of my good .

if thou canst accuse , or aught to lay unto my charge , do it without invention , suddenly , as i with sudden and extemporal speech purpose to answer what thou canst object .
presumptuous priest !
this place commands my patience , or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour me .
think not , although in writing i preferr the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes , that therefore i have forged , or am not able verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen no , prelate , such is thy audacious wickedness , thy lewd , pestiferous and dissentious pranks , as very infants prattle of thy pride .
thou art a most pernicious usurer , forward by nature , enemy to peace , lascivious , wanton , more than well beseems a man of thy profession and degree , and for thy treachery , what more manifest ?
in that thou a trap to take my life , as well at london bridge as at the tower .
beside , i fear me , if thy thoughts were sifted , the king , thy sovereign , is not quite exempt from envious malice of thy swelling heart .
bishop gloucester , i do defy thee .
lords , vouchsafe to give me hearing what i shall reply .
if i were covetous , ambitious or perverse , as he will have me , how am i so poor ?
or how haps it i seek not to advance or raise myself , but keep my wonted calling ?
and for dissension , who preferreth peace more than i do ? except i be provoked .
no , my good lords , it is not that offends , it is not that that hath incensed the duke it is , because no one should sway but he , no one but he should be about the king , and that engenders thunder in his breast and makes him roar these accusations forth .
but he shall know i am as good as good !
thou bastard of my grandfather !
bishop ay , lordly sir , for what are you , i pray , but one imperious in another throne ?
am i not protector , saucy priest ?
bishop and am not i a prelate of the church ?
yes , as an outlaw in a castle keeps and useth it to patronage his theft .
bishop unreverent gloster !
thou art reverent touching thy spiritual function , not thy life .
bishop rome shall remedy this .
roam thither , then .
my lord , it were your duty to forbear .
ay , see the bishop be not overborne .
methinks my lord should be religious and know the office that belongs to such .
methinks his lordship should be humbler , it fitteth not a prelate so to plead .
yes , when his holy state is touch so near .
state holy or unhallow , what of that ?
is not his grace protector to the king ?
richard aside plantagenet , i see , must hold his tongue , lest it be said , sirrah , when you should , must your bold verdict enter talk with lords ? '
else would i have a fling at winchester .
uncles of gloucester and of winchester , the special watchmen of our english weal , i would prevail , if prayers might prevail , to join your hearts in love and amity .
o , what a scandal is it to our crown , that two such noble peers as ye should jar !
believe me , lords , my tender years can tell civil dissension is a viperous worm that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth .

enter mayor o , my good lords , and virtuous henry , pity the city of london , pity us !
the bishop and the duke of gloucester men , forbidden late to carry any weapon , have fill their pockets full of pebble stones and banding themselves in contrary parts do pelt so fast at one another pate that many have their giddy brains knock out our windows are broke down in every street and we for fear compell to shut our shops .
enter , in skirmish , with bloody pates we charge you , on allegiance to ourself , to hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace .
pray , uncle gloucester , mitigate this strife .
first nay , if we be forbidden stones , we fall to it with our teeth .
second do what ye dare , we are as resolute .
skirmish again you of my household , leave this peevish broil and set this unaccustom fight aside .
third my lord , we know your grace to be a man just and upright , and , for your royal birth , inferior to none but to his majesty and ere that we will suffer such a prince , so kind a father of the commonweal , to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate , we and our wives and children all will fight and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes .
first ay , and the very parings of our nails shall pitch a field when we are dead .
begin again stay , stay , i say !
and if you love me , as you say you do , let me persuade you to forbear awhile .
o , how this discord doth afflict my soul !
can you , my lord of winchester , behold my sighs and tears and will not once relent ?
who should be pitiful , if you be not ?
or who should study to prefer a peace .
if holy churchmen take delight in broils ?
yield , my lord protector , yield , winchester , except you mean with obstinate repulse to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm .
you see what mischief and what murder too hath been enacted through your enmity , then be at peace except ye thirst for blood .
bishop he shall submit , or i will never yield .
compassion on the king commands me stoop , or i would see his heart out , ere the priest should ever get that privilege of me .
behold , my lord of winchester , the duke hath banish moody discontented fury , as by his smoothed brows it doth appear why look you still so stern and tragical ?
here , winchester , i offer thee my hand .
fie , uncle beaufort !
i have heard you preach that malice was a great and grievous sin , and will not you maintain the thing you teach , but prove a chief offender in the same ?
sweet king !
the bishop hath a kindly gird .
for shame , my lord of winchester , relent !
what , shall a child instruct you what to do ?
bishop well , duke of gloucester , i will yield to thee , love for thy love and hand for hand i give .
aside ay , but , i fear me , with a hollow see here , my friends and loving countrymen , this token serveth for a flag of truce betwixt ourselves and all our followers so help me god , as i dissemble not !
bishop aside so help me god , as i intend it not !
o , loving uncle , kind duke of gloucester , how joyful am i made by this contract !
away , my masters !
trouble us no more , but join in friendship , as your lords have done .
first content i to the surgeon .
second and so will i .
third and i will see what physic the tavern affords .
exeunt , mayor , and c accept this scroll , most gracious sovereign , which in the right of richard plantagenet we do exhibit to your majesty .
well urged , my lord of warwick or sweet prince , and if your grace mark every circumstance , you have great reason to do richard right , especially for those occasions at eltham place i told your majesty .
and those occasions , uncle , were of force therefore , my loving lords , our pleasure is that richard be restored to his blood .
let richard be restored to his blood , so shall his father wrongs be recompensed .
bishop as will the rest , so willeth winchester .
if richard will be true , not that alone but all the whole inheritance i give that doth belong unto the house of york , from whence you spring by lineal descent .
richard thy humble servant vows obedience and humble service till the point of death .
stoop then and set your knee against my foot , and , in reguerdon of that duty done , i gird thee with the valiant sword of york rise richard , like a true plantagenet , and rise created princely duke of york .
richard and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall !
and as my duty springs , so perish they that grudge one thought against your majesty !
welcome , high prince , the mighty duke of york !
aside perish , base prince , ignoble duke of york !
now will it best avail your majesty to cross the seas and to be crown in france the presence of a king engenders love amongst his subjects and his loyal friends , as it disanimates his enemies .

this late dissension grown betwixt the peers burns under feigned ashes of forged love and will at last break out into a flame as fester members rot but by degree , till bones and flesh and sinews fall away , so will this base and envious discord breed .
and now i fear that fatal prophecy which in the time of henry named the fifth was in the mouth of every sucking babe , that henry born at monmouth should win all and henry born at windsor lose all which is so plain that exeter doth wish his days may finish ere that hapless time .

lord talbot , do not so dishonour me here will i sit before the walls of rouen and will be partner of your weal or woe .
courageous bedford , let us now persuade you .
not to be gone from hence , for once i read that stout pendragon in his litter sick came to the field and vanquished his foes methinks i should revive the soldiers ' hearts , because i ever found them as myself .
undaunted spirit in a dying breast !
then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe !
and now no more ado , brave burgundy , but gather we our forces out of hand and set upon our boasting enemy .
exeunt all but bedford and attendants an alarum excursions .
enter fastolfe and a captain whither away , sir john fastolfe , in such haste ?
whither away !
to save myself by flight we are like to have the overthrow again .
what !
will you fly , and leave lord talbot ?
ay , all the talbots in the world , to save my life !
exit cowardly knight !
ill fortune follow thee !
exit retreat excursions .
joan la pucelle , alencon , and charles fly now , quiet soul , depart when heaven please , for i have seen our enemies ' overthrow .
what is the trust or strength of foolish man ?
they that of late were daring with their scoffs are glad and fain by flight to save themselves .
bedford dies , and is carried in by two in his chair an alarum .
talbot , burgundy , and the rest lost , and recover in a day again !
this is a double honour , burgundy yet heavens have glory for this victory !
warlike and martial talbot , burgundy enshrines thee in his heart and there erects thy noble deeds as valour monuments .
thanks , gentle duke .
but where is pucelle now ?
i think her old familiar is asleep now where the bastard braves , and charles his gleeks ?
what , all amort ?
rouen hangs her head for grief that such a valiant company are fled .
now will we take some order in the town , placing therein some expert officers , and then depart to paris to the king , for there young henry with his nobles lie .
what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy .
but yet , before we go , let not forget the noble duke of bedford late deceased , but see his exequies fulfill in rouen a braver soldier never couched lance , a gentler heart did never sway in court , but kings and mightiest potentates must die , for that the end of human misery .
exeunt scene iii .
the plains near rouen .
enter charles , the bastard of orleans , alencon , joan la pucelle , and forces dismay not , princes , at this accident , nor grieve that rouen is so recovered care is no cure , but rather corrosive , for things that are not to be remedied .
let frantic talbot triumph for a while and like a peacock sweep along his tail , we pull his plumes and take away his train , if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled .
we have been guided by thee hitherto , and of thy cunning had no diffidence one sudden foil shall never breed distrust .
search out thy wit for secret policies , and we will make thee famous through the world .
we set thy statue in some holy place , and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint employ thee then , sweet virgin , for our good .
then thus it must be , this doth joan devise by fair persuasions mix with sugar words we will entice the duke of burgundy to leave the talbot and to follow us .
ay , marry , sweeting , if we could do that , france were no place for henry warriors , nor should that nation boast it so with us , but be extirped from our provinces .
for ever should they be expulsed from france and not have title of an earldom here .
your honours shall perceive how i will work to bring this matter to the wished end .
drum sounds afar off hark !
by the sound of drum you may perceive their powers are marching unto .
here sound an english march .
enter , and pass over at a distance , talbot and his forces there goes the talbot , with his colours spread , and all the troops of english after him .
french march .
enter burgundy and forces now in the rearward comes the duke and his fortune in favour makes him lag behind .
summon a parley , we will talk with him .
trumpets sound a parley a parley with the duke of burgundy !
who craves a parley with the burgundy ?
the princely charles of france , thy countryman .
what thou , charles ?
for i am marching hence .
speak , pucelle , and enchant him with thy words .
brave burgundy , undoubted hope of france !
stay , let thy humble handmaid speak to thee .
speak on , but be not .
look on thy country , look on fertile france , and see the cities and the towns defaced by wasting ruin of the cruel foe .
as looks the mother on her lowly babe when death doth close his tender dying eyes , see , see the pining malady of france , behold the wounds , the most unnatural wounds , which thou thyself hast given her woful breast .
o , turn thy edged sword another way , strike those that hurt , and hurt not those that help .
one drop of blood drawn from thy country bosom should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore return thee therefore with a flood of tears , and wash away thy country stained spots .
either she hath bewitch me with her words , or nature makes me suddenly relent .
besides , all french and france exclaims on thee , doubting thy birth and lawful progeny .
who thou with but with a lordly nation that will not trust thee but for profit sake ?
when talbot hath set footing once in france and fashion thee that instrument of ill , who then but english henry will be lord and thou be thrust out like a fugitive ?
call we to mind , and mark but this for proof , was not the duke of orleans thy foe ?
and was he not in england prisoner ?
but when they heard he was thine enemy , they set him free without his ransom paid , in spite of burgundy and all his friends .
see , then , thou against thy countrymen and with them will be thy slaughtermen .
come , come , return , return , thou wandering lord charles and the rest will take thee in their arms .
i am vanquished , these haughty words of hers have batter me like roaring , and made me almost yield upon my knees .
forgive me , country , and sweet countrymen , and , lords , accept this hearty kind embrace my forces and my power of men are yours so farewell , talbot , i no longer trust thee .
aside done like a frenchman turn , and turn again !
welcome , brave duke !
thy friendship makes us fresh .
and doth beget new courage in our breasts .
pucelle hath bravely play her part in this , and doth deserve a coronet of gold .
now let us on , my lords , and join our powers , and seek how we may prejudice the foe .

kneels is this the lord talbot , uncle gloucester , that hath so long been resident in france ?
yes , if it please your majesty , my liege .
welcome , brave captain and victorious lord !
when i was young , as yet i am not old , i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword .
long since we were resolved of your truth , your faithful service and your toil in war , yet never have you tasted our reward , or been reguerdon with so much as thanks , because till now we never saw your face therefore , stand up , and , for these good deserts , we here create you earl of shrewsbury , and in our coronation take your place .

sirrah , thy lord i honour as he is .
why , what is he ?
as good a man as york .
hark ye , not so in witness , take ye that .
strikes him villain , thou the law of arms is such that whoso draws a sword , is present death , or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood .

now , governor of paris , take your oath , that you elect no other king but him , esteem none friends but such as are his friends , and none your foes but such as shall pretend malicious practises against his state this shall ye do , so help you righteous god !
enter fastolfe my gracious sovereign , as i rode from calais , to haste unto your coronation , a letter was deliver to my hands , writ to your grace from the duke of burgundy .
shame to the duke of burgundy and thee !
i vow , base knight , when i did meet thee next , to tear the garter from thy craven leg , plucking it off which i have done , because unworthily thou wast installed in that high degree .
pardon me , princely henry , and the rest this dastard , at the battle of patay , when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one , before we met or that a stroke was given , like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men , myself and divers gentlemen beside were there surprised and taken prisoners .
then judge , great lords , if i have done amiss , or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood , yea or no .
to say the truth , this fact was infamous and ill beseeming any common man , much more a knight , a captain and a leader .
when first this order was ordain , my lords , knights of the garter were of noble birth , valiant and virtuous , full of haughty courage , such as were grown to credit by the wars , not fearing death , nor shrinking for distress , but always resolute in most extremes .
he then that is not furnish in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight , profaning this most honourable order , and should , if i were worthy to be judge , be quite degraded , like a swain that doth presume to boast of gentle blood .
stain to thy countrymen , thou thy doom !
be packing , therefore , thou that wast a knight henceforth we banish thee , on pain of death .
exit fastolfe and now , my lord protector , view the letter sent from our uncle duke of burgundy .
what means his grace , that he hath changed his style ?
no more but , plain and bluntly , the king ! '
hath he forgot he is his sovereign ?
or doth this churlish superscription pretend some alteration in good will ?
what here ?
reads ' i have , upon especial cause , moved with compassion of my country wreck , together with the pitiful complaints of such as your oppression feeds upon , forsaken your pernicious faction and join with charles , the rightful king of france . '
o monstrous treachery !
can this be so , that in alliance , amity and oaths , there should be found such false dissembling guile ?
what !
doth my uncle burgundy revolt ?
he doth , my lord , and is become your foe .
is that the worst this letter doth contain ?
it is the worst , and all , my lord , he writes .
why , then , lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse .
how say you , my lord ?
are you not content ?
content , my liege !
yes , but that i am prevented , i should have begg i might have been employ .
then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason and what offence it is to flout his friends .
i go , my lord , in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes .
exit enter vernon and basset grant me the combat , gracious sovereign .
and me , my lord , grant me the combat too .
this is my servant hear him , noble prince .
and this is mine sweet henry , favour him .
be patient , lords , and give them leave to speak .
say , gentlemen , what makes you thus exclaim ?
and wherefore crave you combat ?
or with whom ?
with him , my lord , for he hath done me wrong .
and i with him , for he hath done me wrong .
what is that wrong whereof you both complain ?
first let me know , and then i answer you .
crossing the sea from england into france , this fellow here , with envious carping tongue , upbraided me about the rose i wear , saying , the sanguine colour of the leaves did represent my master blushing cheeks , when stubbornly he did repugn the truth about a certain question in the law argued betwixt the duke of york and him , with other vile and ignominious terms in confutation of which rude reproach and in defence of my lord worthiness , i crave the benefit of law of arms .
and that is my petition , noble lord for though he seem with forged quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent , yet know , my lord , i was provoked by him , and he first took exceptions at this badge , pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewray the faintness of my master heart .
will not this malice , somerset , be left ?
your private grudge , my lord of york , will out , though so cunningly you smother it .
good lord , what madness rules in brainsick men , when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise !
good cousins both , of york and somerset , quiet yourselves , i pray , and be at peace .
let this dissension first be tried by fight , and then your highness shall command a peace .
the quarrel toucheth none but us alone , betwixt ourselves let us decide it then .
there is my pledge , accept it , somerset .
nay , let it rest where it began at first .
confirm it so , mine honourable lord .
confirm it so !
confounded be your strife !
and perish ye , with your audacious prate !
presumptuous vassals , are you not ashamed with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us ?
and you , my lords , methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections , much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves let me persuade you take a better course .
it grieves his highness good my lords , be friends .
come hither , you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you , as you love our favour , quite to forget this quarrel and the cause .
and you , my lords , remember where we are , in france , amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree , how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to wilful disobedience , and rebel !
beside , what infamy will there arise , when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy , a thing of no regard , king henry peers and chief nobility destroy themselves , and lost the realm of france !
o , think upon the conquest of my father , my tender years , and let us not forego that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife .
i see no reason , if i wear this rose , putting on a red rose that any one should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen , and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown , because , forsooth , the king of scots is crown .
but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore , as we hither came in peace , so let us still continue peace and love .
cousin of york , we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france and , good my lord of somerset , unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot , and , like true subjects , sons of your progenitors , go cheerfully together and digest .
your angry choler on your enemies .
ourself , my lord protector and the rest after some respite will return to calais , from thence to england , where i hope ere long to be presented , by your victories , with charles , alencon and that traitorous rout .
flourish .
exeunt all but york , warwick , exeter and vernon my lord of york , i promise you , the king prettily , methought , did play the orator .
and so he did , but yet i like it not , in that he wears the badge of somerset .
tush , that was but his fancy , blame him not , i dare presume , sweet prince , he thought no harm .
an if i wist he did , but let it rest , other affairs must now be managed .
exeunt all but exeter well didst thou , richard , to suppress thy voice , for , had the passions of thy heart burst out , i fear we should have seen decipher there more rancorous spite , more furious raging broils , than yet can be imagined or supposed .
but , no simple man that sees this jarring discord of nobility , this shouldering of each other in the court , this factious bandying of their favourites , but that it doth presage some ill event .
is much when sceptres are in children hands , but more when envy breeds unkind division , there comes the rain , there begins confusion .

thou ominous and fearful owl of death , our nation terror and their bloody scourge !
the period of thy tyranny approacheth .
on us thou canst not enter but by death , for , i protest , we are well fortified and strong enough to issue out and fight if thou retire , the dauphin , well appointed , stands with the snares of war to tangle thee on either hand thee there are squadrons pitch , to wall thee from the liberty of flight , and no way canst thou turn thee for redress , but death doth front thee with apparent spoil and pale destruction meets thee in the face .
ten thousand french have the sacrament to rive their dangerous artillery upon no christian soul but english talbot .
lo , there thou , a breathing valiant man , of an invincible unconquer spirit !

how are we park and bounded in a pale , a little herd of england timorous deer , mazed with a yelping kennel of french curs !
if we be english deer , be then in blood , not , to fall down with a pinch , but rather , and desperate stags , turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel and make the cowards stand aloof at bay sell every man his life as dear as mine , and they shall find dear deer of us , my friends .

a plague upon that villain somerset , that thus delays my promised supply of horsemen , that were levied for this siege !
renowned talbot doth expect my aid , and i am lowted by a traitor villain and can not help the noble chevalier god comfort him in this necessity !

else , farewell talbot , france , and england honour .
o god , that somerset , who in proud heart doth stop my cornets , were in talbot place !
so should we save a valiant gentleman by forfeiting a traitor and a coward .
mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep , that thus we die , while remiss traitors sleep .
o , send some succor to the distress lord !
he dies , we lose , i break my warlike word , we mourn , france smiles , we lose , they daily get , all of this vile traitor somerset .
then god take mercy on brave talbot soul , and on his son young john , who two hours since i met in travel toward his warlike father !
this seven years did not talbot see his son , and now they meet where both their lives are done .
alas , what joy shall noble talbot have to bid his young son welcome to his grave ?
away !
vexation almost stops my breath , that sunder friends greet in the hour of death .
lucy , farewell , no more my fortune can , but curse the cause i can not aid the man .
maine , blois , poictiers , and tours , are won away , all of somerset and his delay .

here is sir william lucy , who with me set from our forces forth for aid .
enter sir william lucy how now , sir william !
whither were you sent ?
whither , my lord ?
from bought and sold lord talbot , who , ring about with bold adversity , cries out for noble york and somerset , to beat assailing death from his weak legions and whiles the honourable captain there drops bloody sweat from his limbs , and , in advantage lingering , looks for rescue , you , his false hopes , the trust of england honour , keep off aloof with worthless emulation .
let not your private discord keep away the levied succors that should lend him aid , while he , renowned noble gentleman , yields up his life unto a world of odds orleans the bastard , charles , burgundy , alencon , reignier , compass him about , and talbot perisheth by your default .
york set him on , york should have sent him aid .
and york as fast upon your grace exclaims , swearing that you withhold his levied host , collected for this expedition .
york lies , he might have sent and had the horse , i owe him little duty , and less love , and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending .
the fraud of england , not the force of france , hath now entrapp the talbot never to england shall he bear his life , but dies , betray to fortune by your strife .
come , go , i will dispatch the horsemen straight within six hours they will be at his aid .
too late comes rescue he is or slain , for fly he could not , if he would have fled , and fly would talbot never , though he might .
if he be dead , brave talbot , then adieu !
his fame lives in the world , his shame in you .
exeunt scene the english camp near bourdeaux .

i did send for thee to tutor thee in stratagems of war , that talbot name might be in thee revived when sapless age and weak unable limbs should bring thy father to his drooping chair .
but , o malignant and stars !
now thou art come unto a feast of death , a terrible and unavoided danger therefore , dear boy , mount on my swiftest horse , and i direct thee how thou shalt escape by sudden flight come , dally not , be gone .
is my name talbot ?
and am i your son ?
and shall i fly ?
o if you love my mother , dishonour not her honourable name , to make a bastard and a slave of me !
the world will say , he is not talbot blood , that basely fled when noble talbot stood .
fly , to revenge my death , if i be slain .
he that flies so will return again .
if we both stay , we both are sure to die .
then let me stay , and , father , do you fly your loss is great , so your regard should be , my worth unknown , no loss is known in me .
upon my death the french can little boast , in yours they will , in you all hopes are lost .
flight can not stain the honour you have won , but mine it will , that no exploit have done you fled for vantage , everyone will swear , but , if i bow , they say it was for fear .
there is no hope that ever i will stay , if the first hour i shrink and run away .
here on my knee i beg mortality , rather than life preserved with infamy .
shall all thy mother hopes lie in one tomb ?
ay , rather than i shame my mother womb .
upon my blessing , i command thee go .
to fight i will , but not to fly the foe .
part of thy father may be saved in thee .
no part of him but will be shame in me .
thou never hadst renown , nor canst not lose it .
yes , your renowned name shall flight abuse it ?
thy father charge shall clear thee from that stain .
you can not witness for me , being slain .
if death be so apparent , then both fly .
and leave my followers here to fight and die ?
my age was never tainted with such shame .
and shall my youth be guilty of such blame ?
no more can i be sever from your side , than can yourself yourself in twain divide stay , go , do what you will , the like do i , for live i will not , if my father die .
then here i take my leave of thee , fair son , born to eclipse thy life this afternoon .
come , side by side together live and die .
and soul with soul from france to heaven fly .

the regent hath with talbot broke his word and left us to the rage of france his sword .
where is john talbot ?
pause , and take thy breath , i gave thee life and rescued thee from death .
o , twice my father , twice am i thy son !
the life thou gavest me first was lost and done , till with thy warlike sword , despite of late , to my determined time thou gavest new date .
when from the dauphin crest thy sword struck fire , it warm thy father heart with proud desire of victory .
then leaden age , quicken with youthful spleen and warlike rage , beat down alencon , orleans , burgundy , and from the pride of gallia rescued thee .
the ireful bastard orleans , that drew blood from thee , my boy , and had the maidenhood of thy first fight , i soon encountered , and interchanging blows i quickly shed some of his bastard blood , and in disgrace bespoke him thus , , base and misbegotten blood i spill of thine , mean and right poor , for that pure blood of mine which thou didst force from talbot , my brave boy ' here , purposing the bastard to destroy , came in strong rescue .
speak , thy father care , art thou not weary , john ?
how dost thou fare ?
wilt thou yet leave the battle , boy , and fly , now thou art seal the son of chivalry ?
fly , to revenge my death when i am dead the help of one stands me in little stead .
o , too much folly is it , well i wot , to hazard all our lives in one small boat !
if i die not with frenchmen rage , i shall die with mickle age by me they nothing gain an if i stay , is but the shortening of my life one day in thee thy mother dies , our household name , my death revenge , thy youth , and england fame all these and more we hazard by thy stay , all these are saved if thou wilt fly away .
the sword of orleans hath not made me smart , these words of yours draw from my heart on that advantage , bought with such a shame , to save a paltry life and slay bright fame , before young talbot from old talbot fly , the coward horse that bears me fail and die !
and like me to the peasant boys of france , to be shame scorn and subject of mischance !
surely , by all the glory you have won , an if i fly , i am not talbot son then talk no more of flight , it is no boot , if son to talbot , die at talbot foot .
then follow thou thy desperate sire of crete , thou icarus , thy life to me is sweet if thou wilt fight , fight by thy father side , and , commendable proved , let die in pride .

where is valiant john ?
triumphant death , smear with captivity , young talbot valour makes me smile at thee when he perceived me shrink and on my knee , his bloody sword he brandish over me , and , like a hungry lion , did commence rough deeds of rage and stern impatience , but when my angry guardant stood alone , tendering my ruin and assail of none , fury and great rage of heart suddenly made him from my side to start into the clustering battle of the french , and in that sea of blood my boy did drench his spirit , and there died , my icarus , my blossom , in his pride .
o , my dear lord , lo , where your son is borne !
enter soldiers , with the body of john talbot thou antic death , which us here to scorn , anon , from thy insulting tyranny , coupled in bonds of perpetuity , two talbots , winged through the lither sky , in thy despite shall mortality .
o , thou , whose wounds become death , speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath !
brave death by speaking , whether he will or no , imagine him a frenchman and thy foe .
poor boy !
he smiles , methinks , as who should say , had death been french , then death had died .
come , come and lay him in his father arms my spirit can no longer bear these harms .
soldiers , adieu !

how the young whelp of talbot , , did flesh his puny sword in frenchmen blood !
once i encounter him , and thus i said maiden youth , be vanquish by a maid ' but , with a proud majestical high scorn , he answer thus talbot was not born to be the pillage of a giglot wench ' so , rushing in the bowels of the french , he left me proudly , as unworthy fight .
doubtless he would have made a noble knight , see , where he lies inhearsed in the arms of the most bloody nurser of his harms !
hew them to pieces , hack their bones asunder whose life was england glory , gallia wonder .
o , no , forbear !
for that which we have fled during the life , let us not wrong it dead .
enter sir william lucy , attended , herald of the french preceding herald , conduct me to the dauphin tent , to know who hath obtained the glory of the day .

i come to know what prisoners thou hast and to survey the bodies of the dead .
for prisoners thou ?
hell our prison is .
but tell me whom thou .

go , take their bodies hence .

who art thou ?
say , that i may honour thee .
margaret my name , and daughter to a king , the king of naples , thou art .
an earl i am , and suffolk am i call .
be not offended , nature miracle , thou art allotted to be by me so doth the swan her downy cygnets save , keeping them prisoner underneath her wings .
yet , if this servile usage once offend .
go , and be free again , as suffolk friend .
she is going o , stay !
i have no power to let her pass , my hand would free her , but my heart says no as plays the sun upon the glassy streams , twinkling another counterfeited beam , so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes .
fain would i woo her , yet i dare not speak i call for pen and ink , and write my mind .
fie , de la pole !
disable not thyself , hast not a tongue ?
is she not here ?
wilt thou be daunted at a woman sight ?
ay , beauty princely majesty is such , confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough .
say , earl of suffolk if thy name be so what ransom must i pay before i pass ?
for i perceive i am thy prisoner .
how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit , before thou make a trial of her love ?
why thou not ?
what ransom must i pay ?
she beautiful , and therefore to be woo , she is a woman , therefore to be won .
wilt thou accept of ransom ?
yea , or no .
fond man , remember that thou hast a wife , then how can margaret be thy paramour ?
i were best to leave him , for he will not hear .
there all is marr , there lies a cooling card .
he talks at random , sure , the man is mad .
and yet a dispensation may be had .
and yet i would that you would answer me .
i win this lady margaret .
for whom ?
why , for my king tush , that a wooden thing !
he talks of wood it is some carpenter .
yet so my fancy may be satisfied , and peace established between these realms but there remains a scruple in that too , for though her father be the king of naples , duke of anjou and maine , yet is he poor , and our nobility will scorn the match .
hear ye , captain , are you not at leisure ?
it shall be so , disdain they so much .
henry is youthful and will quickly yield .
madam , i have a secret to reveal .
what though i be enthrall ?
he seems a knight , and will not any way dishonour me .
lady , vouchsafe to listen what i say .
perhaps i shall be rescued by the french , and then i need not crave his courtesy .
sweet madam , give me a hearing in a cause tush , women have been captivate ere now .
lady , wherefore talk you so ?
i cry you mercy , is but quid for quo .
say , gentle princess , would you not suppose your bondage happy , to be made a queen ?
to be a queen in bondage is more vile than is a slave in base servility , for princes should be free .
and so shall you , if happy england royal king be free .
why , what concerns his freedom unto me ?
i undertake to make thee henry queen , to put a golden sceptre in thy hand and set a precious crown upon thy head , if thou wilt condescend to be my what ?
his love .
i am unworthy to be henry wife .
no , gentle madam , i unworthy am to woo so fair a dame to be his wife , and have no portion in the choice myself .
how say you , madam , are ye so content ?
an if my father please , i am content .
then call our captains and our colours forth .

i am a soldier , and unapt to weep , or to exclaim on fortune fickleness .
yes , there is remedy enough , my lord consent , and for thy honour give consent , thy daughter shall be wedded to my king , whom i with pain have woo and won thereto , and this her imprisonment hath gained thy daughter princely liberty .
speaks suffolk as he thinks ?
fair margaret knows that suffolk doth not flatter , face , or feign .
upon thy princely warrant , i descend to give thee answer of thy just demand .
exit from the walls and here i will expect thy coming .
trumpets sound .
enter reignier , below welcome , brave earl , into our territories command in anjou what your honour pleases .

since thou dost deign to woo her little worth to be the princely bride of such a lord , upon condition i may quietly enjoy mine own , the country maine and anjou , free from oppression or the stroke of war , my daughter shall be henry , if he please .
that is her ransom , i deliver her , and those two counties i will undertake your grace shall well and quietly enjoy .
and i again , in henry royal name , as deputy unto that gracious king , give thee her hand , for sign of plighted faith .
reignier of france , i give thee kingly thanks , because this is in traffic of a king .

i over then to england with this news , and make this marriage to be solemnized .
so farewell , reignier set this diamond safe in golden palaces , as it becomes .
i do embrace thee , as i would embrace the christian prince , king henry , were he here .
farewell , my lord good wishes , praise and prayers shall suffolk ever have of margaret .
going farewell , sweet madam but hark you , margaret , no princely commendations to my king ?
such commendations as becomes a maid , a virgin and his servant , say to him .
words sweetly placed and modestly directed .
but madam , i must trouble you again , no loving token to his majesty ?
yes , my good lord , a pure unspotted heart , never yet taint with love , i send the king .
and this withal .
kisses her that for thyself i will not so presume to send such peevish tokens to a king .
exeunt reignier and margaret o , wert thou for myself !

now cursed be the time of thy nativity !
i would the milk thy mother gave thee when thou her breast , had been a little ratsbane for thy sake !

dost thou deny thy father , cursed drab ?

exit take her away , for she hath lived too long , to fill the world with vicious qualities .
first , let me tell you whom you have condemn not me begotten of a shepherd swain , but issued from the progeny of kings , virtuous and holy , chosen from above , by inspiration of celestial grace , to work exceeding miracles on earth .
i never had to do with wicked spirits but you , that are polluted with your lusts , stain with the guiltless blood of innocents , corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices , because you want the grace that others have , you judge it straight a thing impossible to compass wonders but by help of devils .
no , misconceived !
joan of arc hath been a virgin from her tender infancy , chaste and immaculate in very thought , whose maiden blood , thus rigorously effused , will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven .
ay , ay away with her to execution !
and hark ye , sirs , because she is a maid , spare for no faggots , let there be enow place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake , that so her torture may be shortened .
will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts ?
then , joan , discover thine infirmity , that warranteth by law to be thy privilege .
i am with child , ye bloody homicides murder not then the fruit within my womb , although ye hale me to a violent death .
now heaven forfend !
the holy maid with child !
the greatest miracle that ye wrought is all your strict preciseness come to this ?
she and the dauphin have been juggling i did imagine what would be her refuge .
well , go to , we have no bastards live , especially since charles must father it .
you are deceived , my child is none of his it was alencon that enjoy my love .
alencon !

o , give me leave , i have deluded you was neither charles nor yet the duke i named , but reignier , king of naples , that prevail .

why , here a girl !
i think she knows not well , there were so many , whom she may accuse .
it sign she hath been liberal and free .
and yet , forsooth , she is a virgin pure .
strumpet , thy words condemn thy brat and thee use no entreaty , for it is in vain .

exit , guarded break thou in pieces and consume to ashes , thou foul accursed minister of hell !
enter cardinal of winchester , attended cardinal lord regent , i do greet your excellence with letters of commission from the king .
for know , my lords , the states of christendom , moved with remorse of these outrageous broils , have earnestly implored a general peace betwixt our nation and the aspiring french , and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth , to confer about some matter .
is all our travail turn to this effect ?
after the slaughter of so many peers , so many captains , gentlemen and soldiers , that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their country benefit , shall we at last conclude effeminate peace ?
have we not lost most part of all the towns , by treason , falsehood and by treachery , our great progenitors had conquered ?
o warwick , warwick !
i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france .
be patient , york if we conclude a peace , it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby .
enter charles , alencon , bastard of orleans , reignier , and others since , lords of england , it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaim in france , we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be .
speak , winchester , for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poison voice , by sight of these our baleful enemies .
cardinal charles , and the rest , it is enacted thus that , in regard king henry gives consent , of mere compassion and of lenity , to ease your country of distressful war , and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace , you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles , upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute , submit thyself , thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him , and still enjoy thy regal dignity .
must he be then as shadow of himself ?
adorn his temples with a coronet , and yet , in substance and authority , retain but privilege of a private man ?
this proffer is absurd and reasonless .
is known already that i am possess with more than half the gallian territories , and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i , for lucre of the rest unvanquish , detract so much from that prerogative , as to be call but viceroy of the whole ?
no , lord ambassador , i rather keep that which i have than , coveting for more , be cast from possibility of all .
insulting charles !
hast thou by secret means used intercession to obtain a league , and , now the matter grows to compromise , thou aloof upon comparison ?
either accept the title thou , of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert , or we will plague thee with incessant wars .
my lord , you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected , ten to one we shall not find like opportunity .
to say the truth , it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility , and therefore take this compact of a truce , although you break it when your pleasure serves .
how thou , charles ?
shall our condition stand ?
it shall , only reserved , you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison .
then swear allegiance to his majesty , as thou art knight , never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england , thou , nor thy nobles , to the crown of england .
so , now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensign , let your drums be still , for here we entertain a solemn peace .
exeunt scene london .
the palace .
enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi , gloucester and exeter your wondrous rare description , noble earl , of beauteous margaret hath astonish me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed love settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide , so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love .
tush , my good lord , this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise , the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them , would make a volume of enticing lines , able to ravish any dull conceit and , which is more , she is not so divine , so with choice of all delights , but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command , command , i mean , of virtuous chaste intents , to love and honour henry as her lord .
and otherwise will henry presume .
therefore , my lord protector , give consent that margaret may be england royal queen .
so should i give consent to flatter sin .
you know , my lord , your highness is betroth unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract , and not deface your honour with reproach ?
as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths , or one that , at a triumph having vow to try his strength , forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary odds a poor earl daughter is unequal odds , and therefore may be broke without offence .
why , what , i pray , is margaret more than that ?
her father is no better than an earl , although in glorious titles he excel .
yes , lord , her father is a king , the king of naples and jerusalem , and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance .
and so the earl of armagnac may do , because he is near kinsman unto charles .
beside , his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower , where reignier sooner will receive than give .
a dower , my lords !
disgrace not so your king , that he should be so abject , base and poor , to choose for wealth and not for perfect love .
henry is able to enrich his queen and not seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives , as for oxen , sheep , or horse .
marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship , not whom we will , but whom his grace affects , must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore , lords , since he affects her most , it most of all these reasons bindeth us , in our opinions she should be preferr .
for what is wedlock forced but a hell , an age of discord and continual strife ?
whereas the contrary bringeth bliss , and is a pattern of celestial peace .
whom should we match with henry , being a king , but margaret , that is daughter to a king ?
her peerless feature , joined with her birth , approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit , more than in women commonly is seen , will answer our hope in issue of a king , for henry , son unto a conqueror , is likely to beget more conquerors , if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be link in love .
then yield , my lords , and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen , and none but she .
whether it be through force of your report , my noble lord of suffolk , or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love , i can not tell , but this i am assured , i feel such sharp dissension in my breast , such fierce alarums both of hope and fear , as i am sick with working of my thoughts .
take , therefore , shipping , post , my lord , to france , agree to any covenants , and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crown king henry faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge , among the people gather up a tenth .
be gone , i say , for , till you do return , i rest perplexed with a thousand cares .
and you , good uncle , banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were , not what you are , i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will .
and so , conduct me where , from company , i may revolve and ruminate my grief .
exit ay , grief , i fear me , both at first and last .
exeunt gloucester and exeter thus suffolk hath prevail , and thus he goes , as did the youthful paris once to greece , with hope to find the like event in love , but prosper better than the trojan did .

welcome , queen margaret i can express no kinder sign of love than this kind kiss .
o lord , that lends me life , lend me a heart replete with thankfulness !
for thou hast given me in this beauteous face a world of earthly blessings to my soul , if sympathy of love unite our thoughts .
great king of england and my gracious lord , the mutual conference that my mind hath had , by day , by night , waking and in my dreams , in courtly company or at my beads , with you , mine sovereign , makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms , such as my wit affords and of heart doth minister .
her sight did ravish , but her grace in speech , her words with wisdom majesty , makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys , such is the fulness of my heart content .
lords , with one cheerful voice welcome my love .

item , that the duchy of anjou and the county of maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father ' lets the paper fall uncle , how now !
pardon me , gracious lord , some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart and dimm mine eyes , that i can read no further .
uncle of winchester , i pray , read on .
reads , it is further agreed between them , that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father , and she sent over of the king of england own proper cost and charges , without having any dowry . '
they please us well .
lord marquess , kneel down we here create thee the first duke of suffolk , and gird thee with the sword .
cousin of york , we here discharge your grace from being regent i ' the parts of france , till term of eighteen months be full expired .
thanks , uncle winchester , gloucester , york , buckingham , somerset , salisbury , and warwick , we thank you all for the great favour done , in entertainment to my princely queen .
come , let us in , and with all speed provide to see her coronation be perform .
exeunt king henry vi , queen margaret , and suffolk brave peers of england , pillars of the state , to you duke humphrey must unload his grief , your grief , the common grief of all the land .
what !
did my brother henry spend his youth , his valour , coin and people , in the wars ?
did he so often lodge in open field , in winter cold and summer parching heat , to conquer france , his true inheritance ?
and did my brother bedford toil his wits , to keep by policy what henry got ?
have you yourselves , somerset , buckingham , brave york , salisbury , and victorious warwick , received deep scars in france and normandy ?
or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself , with all the learned council of the realm , studied so long , sat in the early and late , debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe , and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes ?
and shall these labours and these honours die ?
shall henry conquest , bedford vigilance , your deeds of war and all our counsel die ?
o peers of england , shameful is this league !
fatal this marriage , cancelling your fame , blotting your names from books of memory , razing the characters of your renown , defacing monuments of conquer france , undoing all , as all had never been !
nephew , what means this passionate discourse , this peroration with such circumstance ?
for france , is ours , and we will keep it still .
ay , uncle , we will keep it , if we can , but now it is impossible we should suffolk , the duke that rules the roast , hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier , whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse .
now , by the death of him that died for all , these counties were the keys of normandy .
but wherefore weeps warwick , my valiant son ?
for grief that they are past recovery for , were there hope to conquer them again , my sword should shed hot blood , mine eyes no tears .
anjou and maine !
myself did win them both , those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities , that i got with wounds , delivered up again with peaceful words ?
mort dieu !
for suffolk duke , may he be suffocate , that dims the honour of this warlike isle !
france should have torn and rent my very heart , before i would have yielded to this league .
i never read but england kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own , to match with her that brings no vantages .
a proper jest , and never heard before , that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her !
she should have stayed in france and starved in france , before my lord of gloucester , now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king .
my lord of winchester , i know your mind , is not my speeches that you do mislike , but is my presence that doth trouble ye .
rancour will out proud prelate , in thy face i see thy fury if i longer stay , we shall begin our ancient bickerings .
lordings , farewell , and say , when i am gone , i prophesied france will be lost ere long .
exit so , there goes our protector in a rage .
is known to you he is mine enemy , nay , more , an enemy unto you all , and no great friend , i fear me , to the king .
consider , lords , he is the next of blood , and heir apparent to the english crown had henry got an empire by his marriage , and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west , there reason he should be displeased at it .
look to it , lords !
let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts , be wise and circumspect .
what though the common people favour him , calling him , the good duke of gloucester , ' clapping their hands , and crying with loud voice , maintain your royal excellence ! '
with preserve the good duke humphrey ! '
i fear me , lords , for all this flattering gloss , he will be found a dangerous protector .
why should he , then , protect our sovereign , he being of age to govern of himself ?
cousin of somerset , join you with me , and all together , with the duke of suffolk , we quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat .
this weighty business will not brook delay i to the duke of suffolk presently .
exit cousin of buckingham , though humphrey pride and greatness of his place be grief to us , yet let us watch the haughty cardinal his insolence is more intolerable than all the princes in the land beside if gloucester be displaced , he be protector .
or thou or i , somerset , will be protector , despite duke humphrey or the cardinal .
exeunt buckingham and somerset pride went before , ambition follows him .
while these do labour for their own preferment , behoves it us to labour for the realm .
i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman .
oft have i seen the haughty cardinal , more like a soldier than a man o ' the church , as stout and proud as he were lord of all , swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal .
warwick , my son , the comfort of my age , thy deeds , thy plainness and thy housekeeping , hath won the greatest favour of the commons , excepting none but good duke humphrey and , brother york , thy acts in ireland , in bringing them to civil discipline , thy late exploits done in the heart of france , when thou wert regent for our sovereign , have made thee fear and honour of the people join we together , for the public good , in what we can , to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal , with somerset and buckingham ambition , and , as we may , cherish duke humphrey deeds , while they do tend the profit of the land .
so god help warwick , as he loves the land , and common profit of his country !
aside and so says york , for he hath greatest cause .
then let make haste away , and look unto the main .
unto the main !
o father , maine is lost , that maine which by main force warwick did win , and would have kept so long as breath did last !
main chance , father , you meant , but i meant maine , which i will win from france , or else be slain , exeunt warwick and salisbury anjou and maine are given to the french , paris is lost , the state of normandy stands on a tickle point , now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles , the peers agreed , and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a duke fair daughter .
i can not blame them all what to them ?
is thine they give away , and not their own .
pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans , still revelling like lords till all be gone , while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof , while all is shared and all is borne away , ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue , while his own lands are bargain for and sold .
methinks the realms of england , france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burn unto the prince heart of calydon .
anjou and maine both given unto the french !
cold news for me , for i had hope of france , even as i have of fertile england soil .
a day will come when york shall claim his own , and therefore i will take the nevils ' parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey , and , when i spy advantage , claim the crown , for that the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right , nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist , nor wear the diadem upon his head , whose humours fits not for a crown .
then , york , be still awhile , till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep , to pry into the secrets of the state , till henry , surfeiting in joys of love , with his new bride and england queen , and humphrey with the peers be at jars then will i raise aloft the rose , with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed , and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster , and , force perforce , i make him yield the crown , whose bookish rule hath pull fair england down .
exit scene ii .
gloucester house .
enter gloucester and his duchess why droops my lord , like corn , hanging the head at ceres ' plenteous load ?
why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows , as frowning at the favours of the world ?
why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth , gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight ?
what seest thou there ?
king henry diadem , enchased with all the honours of the world ?
if so , gaze on , and grovel on thy face , until thy head be circled with the same .
put forth thy hand , reach at the glorious gold .
what , too short ?
i lengthen it with mine and , having both together heaved it up , we both together lift our heads to heaven , and never more abase our sight so low as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground .
o nell , sweet nell , if thou dost love thy lord , banish the canker of ambitious thoughts .
and may that thought , when i imagine ill against my king and nephew , virtuous henry , be my last breathing in this mortal world !
my troublous dream this night doth make me sad .
what dream my lord ?
tell me , and i requite it with sweet rehearsal of my morning dream .
methought this staff , mine in court , was broke in twain , by whom i have forgot , but , as i think , it was by the cardinal , and on the pieces of the broken wand were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset , and william de la pole , first duke of suffolk .
this was my dream what it doth bode , god knows .
tut , this was nothing but an argument that he that breaks a stick of gloucester grove shall lose his head for his presumption .
but list to me , my humphrey , my sweet duke methought i sat in seat of majesty in the cathedral church of westminster , and in that chair where kings and queens are crown , where henry and dame margaret kneel to me and on my head did set the diadem .
nay , eleanor , then must i chide outright presumptuous dame , eleanor , art thou not second woman in the realm , and the protector wife , beloved of him ?
hast thou not worldly pleasure at command , above the reach or compass of thy thought ?
and wilt thou still be hammering treachery , to tumble down thy husband and thyself from top of honour to disgrace feet ?
away from me , and let me hear no more !
what , what , my lord !
are you so choleric with eleanor , for telling but her dream ?
next time i keep my dreams unto myself , and not be cheque .
nay , be not angry , i am pleased again .
enter messenger my lord protector , is his highness ' pleasure you do prepare to ride unto saint alban , where as the king and queen do mean to hawk .
i go .
come , nell , thou wilt ride with us ?
yes , my good lord , i follow presently .
exeunt gloucester and messenger follow i must , i can not go before , while gloucester bears this base and humble mind .
were i a man , a duke , and next of blood , i would remove these tedious and smooth my way upon their headless necks , and , being a woman , i will not be slack to play my part in fortune pageant .
where are you there ?
sir john !
nay , fear not , man , we are alone , here none but thee and i .
enter hume jesus preserve your royal majesty !
what thou ?
majesty !
i am but grace .
but , by the grace of god , and hume advice , your grace title shall be multiplied .
what thou , man ?
hast thou as yet conferr with margery jourdain , the cunning witch , with roger bolingbroke , the conjurer ?
and will they undertake to do me good ?
this they have promised , to show your highness a spirit raised from depth of , that shall make answer to such questions as by your grace shall be propounded him .
it is enough , i think upon the questions when from alban we do make return , we see these things effected to the full .
here , hume , take this reward , make merry , man , with thy confederates in this weighty cause .
exit hume must make merry with the duchess ' gold , marry , and shall .
but how now , sir john hume !
seal up your lips , and give no words but mum the business asketh silent secrecy .
dame eleanor gives gold to bring the witch gold can not come amiss , were she a devil .
yet have i gold flies from another coast , i dare not say , from the rich cardinal and from the great and duke of suffolk , yet i do find it so , for to be plain , they , knowing dame eleanor aspiring humour , have hired me to undermine the duchess and buz these conjurations in her brain .
they say ' a crafty knave does need no broker , ' yet am i suffolk and the cardinal broker .
hume , if you take not heed , you shall go near to call them both a pair of crafty knaves .
well , so it stands , and thus , i fear , at last hume knavery will be the duchess ' wreck , and her attainture will be humphrey fall sort how it will , i shall have gold for all .
exit scene iii .
the palace .
enter three or four petitioners , peter , the armourer man , being one my masters , let stand close my lord protector will come this way by and by , and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill .
marry , the lord protect him , for he a good man !
jesu bless him !
enter suffolk and queen margaret here a ' comes , methinks , and the queen with him .
i be the first , sure .
come back , fool , this is the duke of suffolk , and not my lord protector .
how now , fellow !
anything with me ?
i pray , my lord , pardon me , i took ye for my lord protector .
reading my lord protector ! '
are your supplications to his lordship ?
let me see them what is thine ?
mine is , a please your grace , against john goodman , my lord cardinal man , for keeping my house , and lands , and wife and all , from me .
thy wife , too !
that some wrong , indeed .
what yours ?
what here !
reads the duke of suffolk , for enclosing the commons of melford . '
how now , sir knave !
alas , sir , i am but a poor petitioner of our whole township .
giving his petition against my master , thomas horner , for saying that the duke of york was rightful heir to the crown .
what sayst thou ?
did the duke of york say he was rightful heir to the crown ?
that my master was ?
no , forsooth my master said that he was , and that the king was an usurper .
who is there ?
enter servant take this fellow in , and send for his master with a pursuivant presently we hear more of your matter before the king .
exit servant with peter and as for you , that love to be protected under the wings of our protector grace , begin your suits anew , and sue to him .
tears the supplication away , base cullions !
suffolk , let them go .
come , let be gone .
exeunt my lord of suffolk , say , is this the guise , is this the fashion in the court of england ?
is this the government of britain isle , and this the royalty of albion king ?
what shall king henry be a pupil still under the surly gloucester governance ?
am i a queen in title and in style , and must be made a subject to a duke ?
i tell thee , pole , when in the city tours thou a tilt in honour of my love and stolest away the ladies ' hearts of france , i thought king henry had resembled thee in courage , courtship and proportion but all his mind is bent to holiness , to number on his beads , his champions are the prophets and apostles , his weapons holy saws of sacred writ , his study is his , and his loves are brazen images of canonized saints .
i would the college of the cardinals would choose him pope , and carry him to rome , and set the triple crown upon his head that were a state fit for his holiness .
madam , be patient as i was cause your highness came to england , so will i in england work your grace full content .
beside the haughty protector , have we beaufort , the imperious churchman , somerset , buckingham , and grumbling york and not the least of these but can do more in england than the king .
and he of these that can do most of all can not do more in england than the nevils salisbury and warwick are no simple peers .
not all these lords do vex me half so much as that proud dame , the lord protector wife .
she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies , more like an empress than duke humphrey wife strangers in court do take her for the queen she bears a duke revenues on her back , and in her heart she scorns our poverty shall i not live to be avenged on her ?
contemptuous callet as she is , she vaunted her minions day , the very train of her worst wearing gown was better worth than all my father lands , till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter .
madam , myself have limed a bush for her , and placed a quire of such enticing birds , that she will light to listen to the lays , and never mount to trouble you again .
so , let her rest and , madam , list to me , for i am bold to counsel you in this .
although we fancy not the cardinal , yet must we join with him and with the lords , till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace .
as for the duke of york , this late complaint will make but little for his benefit .
so , one by one , we weed them all at last , and you yourself shall steer the happy helm .
sound a sennet .
enter king henry vi , gloucester , cardinal , buckingham , york , somerset , salisbury , warwick , and the duchess for my part , noble lords , i care not which , or somerset or york , all one to me .
if york have ill demean himself in france , then let him be denay the regentship .
if somerset be unworthy of the place , let york be regent , i will yield to him .
whether your grace be worthy , yea or no , dispute not that york is the worthier .
ambitious warwick , let thy betters speak .
the cardinal not my better in the field .
all in this presence are thy betters , warwick .
warwick may live to be the best of all .
peace , son !
and show some reason , buckingham , why somerset should be preferred in this .
because the king , forsooth , will have it so .
madam , the king is old enough himself to give his censure these are no women matters .
if he be old enough , what needs your grace to be protector of his excellence ?
madam , i am protector of the realm , and , at his pleasure , will resign my place .
resign it then and leave thine insolence .
since thou wert king as who is king but thou ? the commonwealth hath daily run to wreck , the dauphin hath prevail beyond the seas , and all the peers and nobles of the realm have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty .
the commons hast thou rack , the clergy bags are lank and lean with thy extortions .
thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife attire have cost a mass of public treasury .
thy cruelty in execution upon offenders , hath exceeded law , and left thee to the mercy of the law .
they sale of offices and towns in france , if they were known , as the suspect is great , would make thee quickly hop without thy head .
exit gloucester .
queen margaret drops her fan give me my fan what , minion !
can ye not ?
she gives the duchess a box on the ear i cry you mercy , madam , was it you ?
i !
yea , i it was , proud frenchwoman could i come near your beauty with my nails , i set my ten commandments in your face .
sweet aunt , be quiet , was against her will .
against her will !
good king , look in time , she hamper thee , and dandle thee like a baby though in this place most master wear no breeches , she shall not strike dame eleanor unrevenged .
exit lord cardinal , i will follow eleanor , and listen after humphrey , how he proceeds she tickled now , her fume needs no spurs , she gallop far enough to her destruction .
exit gloucester now , lords , my choler being with walking once about the quadrangle , i come to talk of commonwealth affairs .
as for your spiteful false objections , prove them , and i lie open to the law but god in mercy so deal with my soul , as i in duty love my king and country !
but , to the matter that we have in hand i say , my sovereign , york is meetest man to be your regent in the realm of france .
before we make election , give me leave to show some reason , of no little force , that york is most unmeet of any man .
i tell thee , suffolk , why i am unmeet first , for i can not flatter thee in pride , next , if i be appointed for the place , my lord of somerset will keep me here , without discharge , money , or furniture , till france be won into the dauphin hands last time , i danced attendance on his will till paris was besieged , famish , and lost .
that can i witness , and a fouler fact did never traitor in the land commit .
peace , headstrong warwick !
image of pride , why should i hold my peace ?
enter horner , the armourer , and his man peter , guarded because here is a man accused of treason pray god the duke of york excuse himself !
doth any one accuse york for a traitor ?
what thou , suffolk , tell me , what are these ?
please it your majesty , this is the man that doth accuse his master of high treason his words were these that richard , duke of york , was rightful heir unto the english crown and that your majesty was a usurper .
say , man , were these thy words ?
a shall please your majesty , i never said nor thought any such matter god is my witness , i am falsely accused by the villain .
by these ten bones , my lords , he did speak them to me in the garret one night , as we were scouring my lord of york armour .
base dunghill villain and mechanical , i have thy head for this thy traitor speech .
i do beseech your royal majesty , let him have all the rigor of the law .
alas , my lord , hang me , if ever i spake the words .
my accuser is my , and when i did correct him for his fault the other day , he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me i have good witness of this therefore i beseech your majesty , do not cast away an honest man for a villain accusation .
uncle , what shall we say to this in law ?
this doom , my lord , if i may judge let somerset be regent over the french , because in york this breeds suspicion and let these have a day appointed them for single combat in convenient place , for he hath witness of his servant malice this is the law , and this duke humphrey doom .
i humbly thank your royal majesty .
and i accept the combat willingly .
alas , my lord , i can not fight , for god sake , pity my case .
the spite of man prevaileth against me .
o lord , have mercy upon me !
i shall never be able to fight a blow .
o lord , my heart !
sirrah , or you must fight , or else be hang .
away with them to prison , and the day of combat shall be the last of the next month .

madam , sit you and fear not whom we raise , we will make fast within a hallow verge .
here they do the ceremonies belonging , and make the circle , bolingbroke or southwell reads , conjuro te , and it thunders and lightens terribly , then the spirit riseth adsum .

but what a point , my lord , your falcon made , and what a pitch she flew above the rest !
to see how god in all his creatures works !
yea , man and birds are fain of climbing high .
no marvel , an it like your majesty , my lord protector hawks do tower so well , they know their master loves to be aloft , and bears his thoughts above his falcon pitch .
my lord , is but a base ignoble mind that mounts no higher than a bird can soar .
i thought as much , he would be above the clouds .
ay , my lord cardinal ?
how think you by that ?
were it not good your grace could fly to heaven ?
the treasury of everlasting joy .
thy heaven is on earth , thine eyes and thoughts beat on a crown , the treasure of thy heart , pernicious protector , dangerous peer , that it so with king and commonweal !
what , cardinal , is your priesthood grown peremptory ?
tantaene animis coelestibus irae ?
churchmen so hot ?
good uncle , hide such malice , with such holiness can you do it ?
no malice , sir , no more than well becomes so good a quarrel and so bad a peer .
as who , my lord ?
why , as you , my lord , a like your lordly .
why , suffolk , england knows thine insolence .

enter a townsman of saint alban , crying ' a miracle ! '
what means this noise ?
fellow , what miracle dost thou proclaim ?

enter the mayor of saint alban and his brethren , bearing simpcox , between two in a chair , simpcox wife following here comes the townsmen on procession , to present your highness with the man .
great is his comfort in this earthly vale , although by his sight his sin be multiplied .
stand by , my masters bring him near the king , his highness ' pleasure is to talk with him .
good fellow , tell us here the circumstance , that we for thee may glorify the lord .
what , hast thou been long blind and now restored ?
born blind , a please your grace .
ay , indeed , was he .
what woman is this ?
his wife , a like your worship .
hadst thou been his mother , thou couldst have better told .
where wert thou born ?
at berwick in the north , a like your grace .
poor soul , god goodness hath been great to thee let never day nor night unhallow pass , but still remember what the lord hath done .
tell me , good fellow , camest thou here by chance , or of devotion , to this holy shrine ?
god knows , of pure devotion , being call a hundred times and oftener , in my sleep , by good saint alban , who said , , come , come , offer at my shrine , and i will help thee . '
most true , forsooth , and many time and oft myself have heard a voice to call him so .
what , art thou lame ?
ay , god almighty help me !
how camest thou so ?
a fall off of a tree .
a , master .
how long hast thou been blind ?
born so , master .
what , and wouldst climb a tree ?
but that in all my life , when i was a youth .
too true , and bought his climbing very dear .
mass , thou lovedst plums well , that wouldst venture so .
alas , good master , my wife desired some damsons , and made me climb , with danger of my life .
a subtle knave !
but yet it shall not serve .
let me see thine eyes wink now now open them in my opinion yet thou seest not well .
yes , master , clear as day , i thank god and saint alban .
thou me so ?
what colour is this cloak of ?
red , master , red as blood .
why , that well said .
what colour is my gown of ?
black , forsooth as jet .
why , then , thou what colour jet is of ?
and yet , i think , jet did he never see .
but cloaks and gowns , before this day , a many .
never , before this day , in all his life .
tell me , sirrah , what my name ?
alas , master , i know not .
what his name ?
i know not .
nor his ?
no , indeed , master .
what thine own name ?
saunder simpcox , an if it please you , master .
then , saunder , sit there , the lyingest knave in christendom .
if thou hadst been born blind , thou mightest as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear .
sight may distinguish of colours , but suddenly to nominate them all , it is impossible .
my lords , saint alban here hath done a miracle , and would ye not think his cunning to be great , that could restore this cripple to his legs again ?
o master , that you could !
my masters of saint alban , have you not beadles in your town , and things called whips ?
yes , my lord , if it please your grace .
then send for one presently .
sirrah , go fetch the beadle hither straight .
exit an attendant now fetch me a stool hither by and by .
now , sirrah , if you mean to save yourself from whipping , leap me over this stool and run away .
alas , master , i am not able to stand alone you go about to torture me in vain .
enter a beadle with whips well , sir , we must have you find your legs .
sirrah beadle , whip him till he leap over that same stool .
i will , my lord .
come on , sirrah , off with your doublet quickly .
alas , master , what shall i do ?
i am not able to stand .
after the beadle hath hit him once , he leaps over the stool and runs away , and they follow and cry , ' a miracle ! '
o god , seest thou this , and bearest so long ?
it made me laugh to see the villain run .
follow the knave , and take this drab away .
alas , sir , we did it for pure need .
let them be whipped through every , till they come to berwick , from whence they came .
exeunt wife , beadle , mayor , and c duke humphrey has done a miracle .
true , made the lame to leap and fly away .
but you have done more miracles than i , you made in a day , my lord , whole towns to fly .
enter buckingham what tidings with our cousin buckingham ?
such as my heart doth tremble to unfold .
a sort of naughty persons , lewdly bent , under the countenance and confederacy of lady eleanor , the protector wife , the ringleader and head of all this rout , have practised dangerously against your state , dealing with witches and with conjurers whom we have apprehended in the fact , raising up wicked spirits from under ground , demanding of king henry life and death , and other of your highness ' , as more at large your grace shall understand .
aside to gloucester and so , my lord protector , by this means your lady is forthcoming yet at london .
this news , i think , hath turn your weapon edge , is like , my lord , you will not keep your hour .
ambitious churchman , leave to afflict my heart sorrow and grief have vanquish all my powers , and , vanquish as i am , i yield to thee , or to the meanest groom .
o god , what mischiefs work the wicked ones , heaping confusion on their own heads thereby !
gloucester , see here the tainture of thy nest .
and look thyself be faultless , thou wert best .
madam , for myself , to heaven i do appeal , how i have loved my king and commonweal and , for my wife , i know not how it stands , sorry i am to hear what i have heard noble she is , but if she have forgot honour and virtue and conversed with such as , like to pitch , defile nobility , i banish her my bed and company and give her as a prey to law and shame , that hath dishonour gloucester honest name .
well , for this night we will repose us here toward london back again , to look into this business thoroughly and call these foul offenders to their answers and poise the cause in justice ' equal scales , whose beam stands sure , whose rightful cause prevails .

edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard , his only son , who after edward the third death reign as king , till henry bolingbroke , duke of lancaster , the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt , crown by the name of henry the fourth , seized on the realm , deposed the rightful king , sent his poor queen to france , from whence she came , and him to pomfret , where , as all you know , harmless richard was murder traitorously .
father , the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown .
which now they hold by force and not by right , for richard , the first son heir , being dead , the issue of the next son should have reign .
but william of hatfield died without an heir .
the third son , duke of clarence , from whose line i claimed the crown , had issue , philippe , a daughter , who married edmund mortimer , earl of march edmund had issue , roger earl of march , roger had issue , edmund , anne and eleanor .
this edmund , in the reign of bolingbroke , as i have read , laid claim unto the crown , and , but for owen glendower , had been king , who kept him in captivity till he died .
but to the rest .
his eldest sister , anne , my mother , being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge , who was son to edmund langley , edward the third fifth son .
by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march , who was the son of edmund mortimer , who married philippe , sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so , if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger , i am king .
what plain proceeding is more plain than this ?
henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt , the fourth son , york claims it from the third .
till lionel issue fails , his should not reign it fails not yet , but flourishes in thee and in thy sons , fair slips of such a stock .
then , father salisbury , kneel we together , and in this private plot be we the first that shall salute our rightful sovereign with honour of his birthright to the crown .
long live our sovereign richard , england king !
we thank you , lords .
but i am not your king till i be crown and that my sword be stain with of the house of lancaster , and that not suddenly to be perform , but with advice and silent secrecy .
do you as i do in these dangerous days wink at the duke of suffolk insolence , at beaufort pride , at somerset ambition , at buckingham and all the crew of them , till they have snared the shepherd of the flock , that virtuous prince , the good duke humphrey is that they seek , and they in seeking that shall find their deaths , if york can prophesy .
my lord , break we off , we know your mind at full .
my heart assures me that the earl of warwick shall one day make the duke of york a king .
and , nevil , this i do assure myself richard shall live to make the earl of warwick the greatest man in england but the king .

sound a flourish .
exeunt scene iv .
a street .
enter gloucester and his servingmen , in mourning cloaks thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud , and after summer evermore succeeds barren winter , with his wrathful nipping cold so cares and joys abound , as seasons fleet .
sirs , what ?
ten , my lord .
ten is the hour that was appointed me to watch the coming of my punish duchess uneath may she endure the flinty streets , to tread them with her feet .
sweet nell , ill can thy noble mind abrook the abject people gazing on thy face , with envious looks , laughing at thy shame , that erst did follow thy proud when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets .
but , soft !
i think she comes , and i prepare my eyes to see her miseries .
enter the duchess in a white sheet , and a taper burning in her hand , with stanley , the sheriff , and officers so please your grace , we take her from the sheriff .
no , stir not , for your lives , let her pass by .
come you , my lord , to see my open shame ?
now thou dost penance too .
look how they gaze !
see how the giddy multitude do point , and nod their heads , and throw their eyes on thee !
ah , gloucester , hide thee from their hateful looks , and , in thy closet pent up , rue my shame , and ban thine enemies , both mine and thine !
be patient , gentle nell , forget this grief .
ah , gloucester , teach me to forget myself !
for whilst i think i am thy married wife and thou a prince , protector of this land , methinks i should not thus be led along , mail up in shame , with papers on my back , and followed with a rabble that rejoice to see my tears and hear my groans .
the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet , and when i start , the envious people laugh and bid me be advised how i tread .
ah , humphrey , can i bear this shameful yoke ?
thou that i look upon the world , or count them happy that enjoy the sun ?
no , dark shall be my light and night my day , to think upon my pomp shall be my hell .
sometime i say , i am duke humphrey wife , and he a prince and ruler of the land yet so he ruled and such a prince he was as he stood by whilst i , his forlorn duchess , was made a wonder and a to every idle rascal follower .
but be thou mild and blush not at my shame , nor stir at nothing till the axe of death hang over thee , as , sure , it shortly will , for suffolk , he that can do all in all with her that hateth thee and hates us all , and york and impious beaufort , that false priest , have all limed bushes to betray thy wings , and , fly thou how thou canst , they tangle thee but fear not thou , until thy foot be snared , nor never seek prevention of thy foes .
ah , nell , forbear !
thou aimest all awry , i must offend before i be attainted , and had i twenty times so many foes , and each of them had twenty times their power , all these could not procure me any scathe , so long as i am loyal , true and crimeless .
wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach ?
why , yet thy scandal were not wiped away but i in danger for the breach of law .
thy greatest help is quiet , gentle nell i pray thee , sort thy heart to patience , these few days ' wonder will be quickly worn .
enter a herald i summon your grace to his majesty parliament , holden at bury the first of this next month .
and my consent ask herein before !
this is close dealing .
well , i will be there .
exit herald my nell , i take my leave and , master sheriff , let not her penance exceed the king commission .
a please your grace , here my commission stays , and sir john stanley is appointed now to take her with him to the isle of man .
must you , sir john , protect my lady here ?
so am i given in charge , please your grace .
entreat her not the worse in that i pray you use her well the world may laugh again , and i may live to do you kindness if you do it her and so , sir john , farewell !
what , gone , my lord , and bid me not farewell !
witness my tears , i can not stay to speak .
exeunt gloucester and servingmen art thou gone too ?
all comfort go with thee !
for none abides with me my joy is death , death , at whose name i oft have been afear , because i wish this world eternity .
stanley , i prithee , go , and take me hence , i care not whither , for i beg no favour , only convey me where thou art commanded .
why , madam , that is to the isle of man , there to be used according to your state .
that bad enough , for i am but reproach and shall i then be used reproachfully ?
like to a duchess , and duke humphrey lady , according to that state you shall be used .
sheriff , farewell , and better than i fare , although thou hast been conduct of my shame .
it is my office , and , madam , pardon me .
ay , ay , farewell , thy office is discharged .
come , stanley , shall we go ?
madam , your penance done , throw off this sheet , and go we to attire you for our journey .
my shame will not be shifted with my sheet no , it will hang upon my richest robes and show itself , attire me how i can .
go , lead the way , i long to see my prison .
exeunt act iii scene i .
the abbey at bury st .
edmund .
sound a sennet .
enter king henry vi , queen margaret , cardinal , suffolk , york , buckingham , salisbury and warwick to the parliament i muse my lord of gloucester is not come is not his wont to be the hindmost man , occasion keeps him from us now .
can you not see ?
or will ye not observe the strangeness of his alter countenance ?
with what a majesty he bears himself , how insolent of late he is become , how proud , how peremptory , and unlike himself ?
we know the time since he was mild and affable , and if we did but glance a look , immediately he was upon his knee , that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now , and , be it in the morn , when every one will give the time of day , he knits his brow and shows an angry eye , and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee , disdaining duty that to us belongs .
small curs are not regarded when they grin , but great men tremble when the lion roars , and humphrey is no little man in england .
first note that he is near you in descent , and should you fall , he as the next will mount .
me seemeth then it is no policy , respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease , that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness ' council .
by flattery hath he won the commons ' hearts , and when he please to make commotion , is to be fear they all will follow him .
now is the spring , and weeds are , suffer them now , and they the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry .
the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke .
if it be fond , call it a woman fear , which fear if better reasons can supplant , i will subscribe and say i wrong the duke .
my lord of suffolk , buckingham , and york , reprove my allegation , if you can , or else conclude my words effectual .
well hath your highness seen into this duke , and , had i first been put to speak my mind , i think i should have told your grace tale .
the duchess , by his subornation , upon my life , began her devilish practises or , if he were not privy to those faults , yet , by reputing of his high descent , as next the king he was successive heir , and such high vaunts of his nobility , did instigate the bedlam duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereign fall .
smooth runs the water where the brook is deep , and in his simple show he harbours treason .
the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb .
no , no , my sovereign , gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit .
did he not , contrary to form of law , devise strange deaths for small offences done ?
and did he not , in his protectorship , levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers ' pay in france , and never sent it ?
by means whereof the towns each day revolted .
tut , these are petty faults to faults unknown .
which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey .
my lords , at once the care you have of us , to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot , is worthy praise but , shall i speak my conscience , our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous , mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall .
ah , what more dangerous than this fond affiance !
seems he a dove ?
his feathers are but borrowed , for he disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb ?
his skin is surely lent him , for he inclined as is the ravenous wolf .
who can not steal a shape that means deceit ?
take heed , my lord , the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man .
enter somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign !
welcome , lord somerset .
what news from france ?
that all your interest in those territories is utterly bereft you , all is lost .
cold news , lord somerset but god will be done !
aside cold news for me , for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england .
thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away , but i will remedy this gear ere long , or sell my title for a glorious grave .
enter gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king !
pardon , my liege , that i have stay so long .
nay , gloucester , know that thou art come too soon , unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here .
well , suffolk , thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted .
the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me ?
wherein am i guilty ?
is thought , my lord , that you took bribes of france , and , being protector , stayed the soldiers ' pay , by means whereof his highness hath lost france .
is it but thought so ?
what are they that think it ?
i never robb the soldiers of their pay , nor ever had one penny bribe from france .
so help me god , as i have watch the night , ay , night by night , in studying good for england , that doit that i wrested from the king , or any groat i hoarded to my use , be brought against me at my !
no , many a pound of mine own proper store , because i would not tax the needy commons , have i disbursed to the garrisons , and never ask for restitution .
it serves you well , my lord , to say so much .
i say no more than truth , so help me god !
in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of , that england was defamed by tyranny .
why , is well known that , whiles i was protector , pity was all the fault that was in me , for i should melt at an offender tears , and lowly words were ransom for their fault .
unless it were a bloody murderer , or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers , i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed , that bloody sin , i tortured above the felon or what trespass else .
my lord , these faults are easy , quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge , whereof you can not easily purge yourself .
i do arrest you in his highness ' name , and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep , until your further time of trial .
my lord of gloucester , is my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspect my conscience tells me you are innocent .
ah , gracious lord , these days are dangerous virtue is choked with foul ambition and charity chased hence by rancour hand , foul subornation is predominant and equity exiled your highness ' land .
i know their complot is to have my life , and if my death might make this island happy , and prove the period of their tyranny , i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play , for thousands more , that yet suspect no peril , will not conclude their plotted tragedy .
beaufort red sparkling eyes blab his heart malice , and suffolk cloudy brow his stormy hate , sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart , and dogged york , that reaches at the moon , whose overweening arm i have pluck back , by false accuse doth level at my life and you , my sovereign lady , with the rest , causeless have laid disgraces on my head , and with your best endeavour have stirr up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay , all you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicles and all to make away my guiltless life .
i shall not want false witness to condemn me , nor store of treasons to augment my guilt , the ancient proverb will be well effected ' a staff is quickly found to beat a dog . '
my liege , his railing is intolerable if those that care to keep your royal person from treason secret knife and traitors ' rage be thus upbraided , chid and rated at , and the offender granted scope of speech , make them cool in zeal unto your grace .
hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words , though clerkly couch , as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to his state ?
but i can give the loser leave to chide .
far truer spoke than meant i lose , indeed , beshrew the winners , for they play me false !
and well such losers may have leave to speak .
he wrest the sense and hold us here all day lord cardinal , he is your prisoner .
sirs , take away the duke , and guard him sure .
ah !
thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body .
thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side , and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first .
ah , that my fear were false !
ah , that it were !
for , good king henry , thy decay i fear .
exit , guarded my lords , what to your wisdoms seemeth best , do or undo , as if ourself were here .
what , will your highness leave the parliament ?
ay , margaret , my heart is drown with grief , whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes , my body round engirt with misery , for what more miserable than discontent ?
ah , uncle humphrey !
in thy face i see the map of honour , truth and loyalty and yet , good humphrey , is the hour to come that i proved thee false or fear thy faith .
what louring star now envies thy estate , that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life ?
thou never didst them wrong , nor no man wrong , and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch , and beats it when it strays , bearing it to the bloody , even so remorseless have they borne him hence , and as the dam runs lowing up and down , looking the way her harmless young one went , and can do nought but wail her darling loss , even so myself bewails good gloucester case with sad unhelpful tears , and with dimm eyes look after him and can not do him good , so mighty are his vowed enemies .
his fortunes i will weep , and , each groan say a traitor ?
gloucester he is none . '
exeunt all but queen margaret , cardinal , suffolk , and york , somerset remains apart free lords , cold snow melts with the sun hot beams .
henry my lord is cold in great affairs , too full of foolish pity , and gloucester show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers , or as the snake roll in a flowering bank , with shining chequer slough , doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent .
believe me , lords , were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world , to rid us of the fear we have of him .
that he should die is worthy policy , but yet we want a colour for his death is meet he be condemn by course of law .
but , in my mind , that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life , the commons haply rise , to save his life , and yet we have but trivial argument , more than mistrust , that shows him worthy death .
so that , by this , you would not have him die .
ah , york , no man alive so fain as i !
is york that hath more reason for his death .
but , my lord cardinal , and you , my lord of suffolk , say as you think , and speak it from your souls , not all one , an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite , as place duke humphrey for the king protector ?
so the poor chicken should be sure of death .
madam , is true , and not madness , then , to make the fox surveyor of the fold ?
who being accused a crafty murderer , his guilt should be but idly posted over , because his purpose is not executed .
no , let him die , in that he is a fox , by nature proved an enemy to the flock , before his chaps be stain with crimson blood , as humphrey , proved by reasons , to my liege .
and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins , by snares , by subtlety , sleeping or waking , is no matter how , so he be dead , for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit .
suffolk , is resolutely spoke .
not resolute , except so much were done , for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue , seeing the deed is meritorious , and to preserve my sovereign from his foe , say but the word , and i will be his priest .
but i would have him dead , my lord of suffolk , ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed , and i provide his executioner , i tender so the safety of my liege .
here is my hand , the deed is worthy doing .
and so say i .
and i and now we three have spoke it , it skills not greatly who impugns our doom .
enter a post great lords , from ireland am i come amain , to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword send succors , lords , and stop the rage betime , before the wound do grow uncurable , for , being green , there is great hope of help .
a breach that craves a quick expedient stop !
what counsel give you in this weighty cause ?
that somerset be sent as regent thither is meet that lucky ruler be employ , witness the fortune he hath had in france .
if york , with all his policy , had been the regent there instead of me , he never would have stay in france so long .
no , not to lose it all , as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burthen of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost .
show me one scar character on thy skin men flesh preserved so whole do seldom win .
nay , then , this spark will prove a raging fire , if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more , good york , sweet somerset , be still thy fortune , york , hadst thou been regent there , might happily have proved far worse than his .
what , worse than nought ?
nay , then , a shame take all !
and , in the number , thee that wishest shame !
my lord of york , try what your fortune is .
the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men , collected choicely , from each county some , and try your hap against the irishmen ?
i will , my lord , so please his majesty .
why , our authority is his consent , and what we do establish he confirms then , noble york , take thou this task in hand .
i am content provide me soldiers , lords , whiles i take order for mine own affairs .
a charge , lord york , that i will see perform .
but now return we to the false duke humphrey .
no more of him , for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more .
and so break off , the day is almost spent lord suffolk , you and i must talk of that event .
my lord of suffolk , within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers , for there i ship them all for ireland .
i see it truly done , my lord of york .
exeunt all but york now , york , or never , steel thy fearful thoughts , and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hopest to be , or what thou art resign to death , it is not worth the enjoying let fear keep with the man , and find no harbour in a royal heart .
faster than showers comes thought on thought , and not a thought but thinks on dignity .
my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies .
well , nobles , well , is politicly done , to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starved snake , who , cherish in your breasts , will sting your hearts .
was men i lack and you will give them me i take it kindly , and yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madman hands .
whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band , i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell , and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head , like to the glorious sun transparent beams , do calm the fury of this flaw .
and , for a minister of my intent , i have seduced a headstrong kentishman , john cade of ashford , to make commotion , as full well he can , under the title of john mortimer .
in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns , and fought so long , till that his thighs with darts were almost like a porpentine , and , in the end being rescued , i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco , shaking the bloody darts as he his bells .
full often , like a crafty kern , hath he conversed with the enemy , and undiscover come to me again and given me notice of their villanies .
this devil here shall be my substitute , for that john mortimer , which now is dead , in face , in gait , in speech , he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons ' mind , how they affect the house and claim of york .
say he be taken , rack and tortured , i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i moved him to those arms .
say that he thrive , as is great like he will , why , then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sow , for humphrey being dead , as he shall be , and henry put apart , the next for me .

gracious henry , comfort !
what , doth my lord of suffolk comfort me ?
came he right now to sing a raven note , whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers , and thinks he that the chirping of a wren , by crying comfort from a hollow breast , can chase away the sound ?
hide not thy poison with such sugar words , lay not thy hands on me , forbear , i say , their touch affrights me as a serpent sting .
thou baleful messenger , out of my sight !
upon thy murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty , to fright the world .
look not upon me , for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come , basilisk , and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight , for in the shade of death i shall find joy , in life but double death , now gloucester dead .
why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus ?
although the duke was enemy to him , yet he most laments his death and for myself , foe as he was to me , might liquid tears or groans or sighs recall his life , i would be blind with weeping , sick with groans , look pale as primrose with sighs , and all to have the noble duke alive .
what know i how the world may deem of me ?
for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away , so shall my name with slander tongue be wounded , and princes ' courts be fill with my reproach .
this get i by his death ay me , unhappy !
to be a queen , and crown with infamy !
ah , woe is me for gloucester , wretched man !
be woe for me , more wretched than he is .
what , dost thou turn away and hide thy face ?
i am no loathsome leper , look on me .
what !
art thou , like the adder , waxen deaf ?
be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen .
is all thy comfort shut in gloucester tomb ?
why , then , dame margaret was thy joy .
erect his statue and worship it , and make my image but an alehouse sign .
was i for this nigh wreck upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from england bank drove back again unto my native clime ?
what boded this , but well forewarning wind did seem to say not a scorpion nest , nor set no footing on this unkind shore ' ?
what did i then , but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards england blessed shore , or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer , but left that hateful office unto thee the sea refused to drown me , knowing that thou wouldst have me drown on shore , with tears as salt as sea , through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cower in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides , because thy flinty heart , more hard than they , might in thy palace perish margaret .
as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs , when from thy shore the tempest beat us back , i stood upon the hatches in the storm , and when the dusky sky began to rob my sight of thy land view , i took a costly jewel from my neck , a heart it was , bound in with diamonds , and threw it towards thy land the sea received it , and so i wish thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair england view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and call them blind and dusky spectacles , for losing ken of albion wished coast .
how often have i tempted suffolk tongue , the agent of thy foul inconstancy , to sit and witch me , as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his father acts commenced in burning troy !
am i not witch like her ?
or thou not false like him ?
ay me , i can no more !
die , margaret !
for henry weeps that thou dost live so long .
noise within .
enter warwick , salisbury , and many commons it is reported , mighty sovereign , that good duke humphrey traitorously is murder by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort means .
the commons , like an angry hive of bees that want their leader , scatter up and down and care not who they sting in his revenge .
myself have calm their spleenful mutiny , until they hear the order of his death .
that he is dead , good warwick , is too true , but how he died god knows , not henry enter his chamber , view his breathless corpse , and comment then upon his sudden death .
that shall i do , my liege .
stay , salisbury , with the rude multitude till i return .
exit o thou that judgest all things , stay my thoughts , my thoughts , that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphrey life !
if my suspect be false , forgive me , god , for judgment only doth belong to thee .
fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses , and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears , to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk , and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies , and to survey his dead and earthly image , what were it but to make my sorrow greater ?
warwick and others , bearing gloucester body on a bed come hither , gracious sovereign , view this body .
that is to see how deep my grave is made , for with his soul fled all my worldly solace , for seeing him i see my life in death .
as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his father wrathful curse , i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this duke .
a dreadful oath , sworn with a solemn tongue !
what instance gives lord warwick for his vow ?
see how the blood is settled in his face .
oft have i seen a ghost , of ashy semblance , meagre , pale and bloodless , being all descended to the labouring heart , who , in the conflict that it holds with death , attracts the same for aidance the enemy , which with the heart there cools and returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again .
but see , his face is black and full of blood , his further out than when he lived , staring full ghastly like a strangled man , his hair uprear , his nostrils stretched with struggling , his hands abroad display , as one that grasp and tugg for life and was by strength subdued look , on the sheets his hair you see , is sticking , his beard made rough and rugged , like to the summer corn by tempest lodged .
it can not be but he was murder here , the least of all these signs were probable .
why , warwick , who should do the duke to death ?
myself and beaufort had him in protection , and we , i hope , sir , are no murderers .
but both of you were vow duke humphrey foes , and you , forsooth , had the good duke to keep is like you would not feast him like a friend , and is well seen he found an enemy .
then you , belike , suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphrey timeless death .
who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe , but will suspect was he that made the slaughter ?
who finds the partridge in the puttock nest , but may imagine how the bird was dead , although the kite soar with unbloodied beak ?
even so suspicious is this tragedy .
are you the butcher , suffolk ?
where your knife ?
is beaufort term a kite ?
where are his talons ?
i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men , but here a vengeful sword , rusted with ease , that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murder crimson badge .
say , if thou darest , proud lord of , that i am faulty in duke humphrey death .
exeunt cardinal , somerset , and others what dares not warwick , if false suffolk dare him ?
he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller , though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times .
madam , be still , with reverence may i say , for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity .
lord , ignoble in demeanor !
if ever lady wrong her lord so much , thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutor churl , and noble stock was graft with slip , whose fruit thou art , and never of the nevils ' noble race .
but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee , quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames , and that my sovereign presence makes me mild , i would , false murderous coward , on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech , and say it was thy mother that thou that thou thyself was born in bastardy , and after all this fearful homage done , give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell , pernicious of sleeping men !
thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood , if from this presence thou darest go with me .
away even now , or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art , i cope with thee and do some service to duke humphrey ghost .
exeunt suffolk and warwick what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted !
thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just , and he but naked , though lock up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted .
a noise within what noise is this ?
suffolk and warwick , with their weapons drawn why , how now , lords !
your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence !
dare you be so bold ?
why , what tumultuous clamour have we here ?
the traitorous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me , mighty sovereign .
to the commons , entering sirs , stand apart , the king shall know your mind .
dread lord , the commons send you word by me , unless lord suffolk straight be done to death , or banished fair england territories , they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous lingering death .
they say , by him the good duke humphrey died , they say , in him they fear your highness ' death , and mere instinct of love and loyalty , free from a stubborn opposite intent , as being thought to contradict your liking , makes them thus forward in his banishment .
they say , in care of your most royal person , that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death , yet , notwithstanding such a strait edict , were there a serpent seen , with forked tongue , that slily glided towards your majesty , it were but necessary you were waked , lest , being suffer in that harmful slumber , the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal , and therefore do they cry , though you forbid , that they will guard you , whether you will or no , from such fell serpents as false suffolk is , with whose envenomed and fatal sting , your loving uncle , twenty times his worth , they say , is shamefully bereft of life .
within an answer from the king , my lord of salisbury !
is like the commons , rude unpolish hinds , could send such message to their sovereign but you , my lord , were glad to be employ , to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is , that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king .
within an answer from the king , or we will all break in !
go , salisbury , and tell them all from me .
i thank them for their tender loving care , and had i not been cited so by them , yet did i purpose as they do entreat , for , sure , my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolk means and therefore , by his majesty i swear , whose far unworthy deputy i am , he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer , on the pain of death .
exit salisbury o henry , let me plead for gentle suffolk !
ungentle queen , to call him gentle suffolk !
no more , i say if thou dost plead for him , thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath .
had i but said , i would have kept my word , but when i swear , it is irrevocable .
if , after three days ' space , thou here found on any ground that i am ruler of , the world shall not be ransom for thy life .
come , warwick , come , good warwick , go with me , i have great matters to impart to thee .
exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk mischance and sorrow go along with you !
heart discontent and sour affliction be playfellows to keep you company !
there two of you , the devil make a third !
and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps !
cease , gentle queen , these execrations , and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave .
fie , coward woman and wretch !
hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy ?
a plague upon them !
wherefore should i curse them ?
would curses kill , as doth the mandrake groan , i would invent as terms , as curst , as harsh and horrible to hear , deliver strongly through my fixed teeth , with full as many signs of deadly hate , as envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words , mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint , mine hair be fixed on end , as one distract , ay , every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burthen heart would break , should i not curse them .
poison be their drink !
gall , worse than gall , the daintiest that they taste !
their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees !
their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks !
their softest touch as smart as lizards ' sting !
their music frightful as the serpent hiss , and boding make the concert full !
all the foul terrors in hell enough , sweet suffolk , thou thyself , and these dread curses , like the sun glass , or like an overcharged gun , recoil , and turn the force of them upon thyself .
you bade me ban , and will you bid me leave ?
now , by the ground that i am banish from , well could i curse away a winter night , though standing naked on a mountain top , where biting cold would never let grass grow , and think it but a minute spent in sport .
o , let me entreat thee cease .
give me thy hand , that i may dew it with my mournful tears , nor let the rain of heaven wet this place , to wash away my woful monuments .
o , could this kiss be printed in thy hand , that thou mightst think upon these by the seal , through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee !
so , get thee gone , that i may know my grief , is but surmised whiles thou art standing by , as one that surfeits thinking on a want .
i will repeal thee , or , be well assured , adventure to be banished myself and banished i am , if but from thee .
go , speak not to me , even now be gone .
o , go not yet !
even thus two friends condemn embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves , loather a hundred times to part than die .
yet now farewell , and farewell life with thee !
thus is poor suffolk ten times banished , once by the king , and three times thrice by thee .
is not the land i care for , wert thou thence , a wilderness is populous enough , so suffolk had thy heavenly company for where thou art , there is the world itself , with every several pleasure in the world , and where thou art not , desolation .
i can no more live thou to joy thy life , myself no joy in nought but that thou livest .
enter vaux wither goes vaux so fast ?
what news , i prithee ?
to signify unto his majesty that cardinal beaufort is at point of death , for suddenly a grievous sickness took him , that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air , blaspheming god and cursing men on earth .
sometimes he talks as if duke humphrey ghost were by his side , sometime he calls the king , and whispers to his pillow , as to him , the secrets of his overcharged soul , and i am sent to tell his majesty that even now he cries aloud for him .
go tell this heavy message to the king .
exit vaux ay me !
what is this world !
what news are these !
but wherefore grieve i at an hour poor loss , omitting suffolk exile , my soul treasure ?
why only , suffolk , mourn i not for thee , and with the southern clouds contend in tears , theirs for the earth increase , mine for my sorrows ?
now get thee hence the king , thou , is coming , if thou be found by me , thou art but dead .
if i depart from thee , i can not live , and in thy sight to die , what were it else but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap ?
here could i breathe my soul into the air , as mild and gentle as the dying with mother dug between its lips where , from thy sight , i should be raging mad , and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes , to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth , so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul , or i should breathe it so into thy body , and then it lived in sweet elysium .
to die by thee were but to die in jest , from thee to die were torture more than death o , let me stay , befall what may befall !
away !
though parting be a fretful corrosive , it is applied to a deathful wound .
to france , sweet suffolk let me hear from thee , for thou art in this world globe , i have an iris that shall find thee out .
i go .
and take my heart with thee .
a jewel , lock into the cask that ever did contain a thing of worth .
even as a splitted bark , so sunder we this way fall i to death .
this way for me .
exeunt severally scene iii .
a bedchamber .
enter the king , salisbury , warwick , to the cardinal in bed how fares my lord ?
speak , beaufort , to thy sovereign .
if thou death , i give thee england treasure , enough to purchase such another island , so thou wilt let me live , and feel no pain .
ah , what a sign it is of evil life , where death approach is seen so terrible !
beaufort , it is thy sovereign speaks to thee .
bring me unto my trial when you will .
died he not in his bed ?
where should he die ?
can i make men live , whether they will or no ?
o , torture me no more !
i will confess .
alive again ?
then show me where he is i give a thousand pound to look upon him .
he hath no eyes , the dust hath blinded them .
comb down his hair , look , look !
it stands upright , like set to catch my winged soul .
give me some drink , and bid the apothecary bring the strong poison that i bought of him .
o thou eternal mover of the heavens .
look with a gentle eye upon this wretch !
o , beat away the busy meddling fiend that lays strong siege unto this wretch soul .
and from his bosom purge this black despair !
see , how the pangs of death do make him grin !
disturb him not , let him pass peaceably .
peace to his soul , if god good pleasure be !
lord cardinal , if thou on heaven bliss , hold up thy hand , make signal of thy hope .
he dies , and makes no sign .
o god , forgive him !
so bad a death argues a monstrous life .
forbear to judge , for we are sinners all .
close up his eyes and draw the curtain close , and let us all to meditation .
exeunt act iv scene i .
the coast of kent .
alarum .
fight at sea .
ordnance goes off .
enter a captain , a master , a , walter whitmore , and others , with them suffolk , and others , prisoners the gaudy , blabbing and remorseful day is crept into the bosom of the sea , and now wolves arouse the jades that drag the tragic melancholy night , who , with their drowsy , slow and flagging wings , clip dead men graves and from their misty jaws breathe foul contagious darkness in the air .
therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize , for , whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs , here shall they make their ransom on the sand , or with their blood stain this discolour shore .
master , this prisoner freely give i thee , and thou that art his mate , make boot of this , the other , walter whitmore , is thy share .
what is my ransom , master ?
let me know .
a thousand crowns , or else lay down your head .
and so much shall you give , or off goes yours .
what , think you much to pay two thousand crowns , and bear the name and port of gentlemen ?
cut both the villains ' throats , for die you shall the lives of those which we have lost in fight be counterpoised with such a petty sum !
i give it , sir , and therefore spare my life .
and so will i and write home for it straight .
i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard , and therefore to revenge it , shalt thou die , to suffolk and so should these , if i might have my will .
be not so rash , take ransom , let him live .
look on my george , i am a gentleman rate me at what thou wilt , thou shalt be paid .
and so am i , my name is walter whitmore .
how now !
why thou ?
what , doth death affright ?
thy name affrights me , in whose sound is death .
a cunning man did calculate my birth and told me that by water i should die yet let not this make thee be , thy name is gaultier , being rightly sounded .
gaultier or walter , which it is , i care not never yet did base dishonour blur our name , but with our sword we wiped away the blot , therefore , when i sell revenge , broke be my sword , my arms torn and defaced , and i proclaim a coward through the world !
stay , whitmore , for thy prisoner is a prince , the duke of suffolk , william de la pole .
the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags !
ay , but these rags are no part of the duke jove sometimes went disguised , and why not i ?
but jove was never slain , as thou shalt be .
obscure and lowly swain , king henry blood , the honourable blood of lancaster , must not be shed by such a jaded groom .
hast thou not kiss thy hand and held my stirrup ?
plodded by my mule and thought thee happy when i shook my head ?
how often hast thou waited at my cup , fed from my trencher , kneel down at the board .
when i have feasted with queen margaret ?
remember it and let it make thee , ay , and allay this thy abortive pride , how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood and duly waited for my coming forth ?
this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf , and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue .
speak , captain , shall i stab the forlorn swain ?
first let my words stab him , as he hath me .
base slave , thy words are blunt and so art thou .
convey him hence and on our longboat side strike off his head .
thou darest not , for thy own .
yes , pole .
pole !
pool !
sir pool !
lord !
ay , kennel , puddle , sink , whose filth and dirt troubles the silver spring where england drinks .
now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth for swallowing the treasure of the realm thy lips that kiss the queen shall sweep the ground , and thou that smiledst at good duke humphrey death , against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain , who in contempt shall hiss at thee again and wedded be thou to the hags of hell , for daring to affy a mighty lord unto the daughter of a worthless king , having neither subject , wealth , nor diadem .
by devilish policy art thou grown great , and , like ambitious sylla , overgorged with gobbets of thy mother bleeding heart .
by thee anjou and maine were sold to france , the false revolting normans thorough thee disdain to call us lord , and picardy hath slain their governors , surprised our forts , and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home .
the princely warwick , and the nevils all , whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain , as hating thee , are rising up in arms and now the house of york , thrust from the crown by shameful murder of a guiltless king and lofty proud encroaching tyranny , burns with revenging fire , whose hopeful colours advance our sun , striving to shine , under the which is writ nubibus . '
the commons here in kent are up in arms and , to conclude , reproach and beggary is crept into the palace of our king .
and all by thee .
away !
convey him hence .
o that i were a god , to shoot forth thunder upon these paltry , servile , abject drudges !
small things make base men proud this villain here , being captain of a pinnace , threatens more than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate .
drones suck not eagles ' blood but rob beehives it is impossible that i should die by such a lowly vassal as thyself .
thy words move rage and not remorse in me i go of message from the queen to france , i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel .
walter , come , suffolk , i must waft thee to thy death .
gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear .
thou shalt have cause to fear before i leave thee .
what , are ye daunted now ?
now will ye stoop ?
my gracious lord , entreat him , speak him fair .
suffolk imperial tongue is stern and rough , used to command , untaught to plead for favour .
far be it we should honour such as these with humble suit no , rather let my head stoop to the block than these knees bow to any save to the god of heaven and to my king , and sooner dance upon a bloody pole than stand uncover to the vulgar groom .
true nobility is exempt from fear more can i bear than you dare execute .
hale him away , and let him talk no more .
come , soldiers , show what cruelty ye can , that this my death may never be forgot !
great men oft die by vile bezonians a roman sworder and banditto slave murder sweet tully , brutus ' bastard hand stabb julius caesar , savage islanders pompey the great , and suffolk dies by pirates .
exeunt whitmore and others with suffolk and as for these whose ransom we have set , it is our pleasure one of them depart , therefore come you with us and let him go .
exeunt all but the first gentleman whitmore with suffolk body there let his head and lifeless body lie , until the queen his mistress bury it .

nay , is too true , therefore he shall be king .
sir , he made a chimney in my father house , and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it , therefore deny it not .

and furthermore , well have the lord say head for selling the dukedom of maine .
and good reason , for thereby is england mained , and fain to go with a staff , but that my puissance holds it up .
fellow kings , i tell you that that lord say hath gelded the commonwealth , and made it an eunuch and more than that , he can speak french , and therefore he is a traitor .
o gross and miserable ignorance !
nay , answer , if you can the frenchmen are our enemies , go to , then , i ask but this can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor , or no ?
no , no , and therefore we have his head .
well , seeing gentle words will not prevail , assail them with the army of the king .

be it known unto thee by these presence , even the presence of lord mortimer , that i am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art .
thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school , and whereas , before , our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally , thou hast caused printing to be used , and , contrary to the king , his crown and dignity , thou hast built a .
it will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb , and such abominable words as no christian ear can endure to hear .
thou hast appointed justices of peace , to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer .
moreover , thou hast put them in prison , and because they could not read , thou hast hanged them , when , indeed , only for that cause they have been most worthy to live .
thou dost ride in a , dost thou not ?
what of that ?

justice with favour have i always done , prayers and tears have moved me , gifts could never .
when have i aught exacted at your hands , but to maintain the king , the realm and you ?
large gifts have i bestow on learned clerks , because my book preferr me to the king , and seeing ignorance is the curse of god , knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven , unless you be possess with devilish spirits , you can not but forbear to murder me this tongue hath parley unto foreign kings for your behoof , tut , when thou one blow in the field ?

alas , he hath no home , no place to fly to , nor knows he how to live but by the spoil , unless by robbing of your friends and us .
not a shame , that whilst you live at jar , the fearful french , whom you late vanquished , should make a start seas and vanquish you ?
methinks already in this civil broil i see them lording it in london streets , crying ! '

enter cade fie on ambition !
fie on myself , that have a sword , and yet am ready to famish !
these five days have i hid me in these woods and durst not peep out , for all the country is laid for me , but now am i so hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a thousand years i could stay no longer .
wherefore , on a brick wall have i climbed into this garden , to see if i can eat grass , or pick a sallet another while , which is not amiss to cool a man stomach this hot weather .
and i think this word ' was born to do me good for many a time , but for a sallet , my brainpan had been cleft with a brown bill , and many a time , when i have been dry and bravely marching , it hath served me instead of a quart pot to drink in , and now the word ' must serve me to feed on .
enter iden lord , who would live turmoiled in the court , and may enjoy such quiet walks as these ?
this small inheritance my father left me contenteth me , and worth a monarchy .
i seek not to wax great by others ' waning , or gather wealth , i care not , with what envy sufficeth that i have maintains my state and sends the poor well pleased from my gate .
here the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray , for entering his without leave .
ah , villain , thou wilt betray me , and get a thousand crowns of the king carrying my head to him but i make thee eat iron like an ostrich , and swallow my sword like a great pin , ere thou and i part .
why , rude companion , thou be , i know thee not , why , then , should i betray thee ?
not enough to break into my garden , and , like a thief , to come to rob my grounds , climbing my walls in spite of me the owner , but thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms ?
brave thee !
ay , by the best blood that ever was broached , and beard thee too .
look on me well i have eat no meat these five days , yet , come thou and thy five men , and if i do not leave you all as dead as a doornail , i pray god i may never eat grass more .
nay , it shall be said , while england stands , that alexander iden , an esquire of kent , took odds to combat a poor famish man .
oppose thy eyes to mine , see if thou canst outface me with thy looks set limb to limb , and thou art far the lesser , thy hand is but a finger to my fist , thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon , my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast , and if mine arm be heaved in the air , thy grave is digg already in the earth .
as for words , whose greatness answers words , let this my sword report what speech forbears .
by my valour , the most complete champion that ever i heard !
steel , if thou turn the edge , or cut not out the clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath , i beseech god on my knees thou mayst be turned to hobnails .
here they fight .
cade falls o , i am slain !
famine and no other hath slain me let ten thousand devils come against me , and give me but the ten meals i have lost , and i defy them all .
wither , garden , and be henceforth a to all that do dwell in this house , because the unconquered soul of cade is fled .
cade that i have slain , that monstrous traitor ?
sword , i will hollow thee for this thy deed , and hang thee my tomb when i am dead shall this blood be wiped from thy point , but thou shalt wear it as a herald coat , to emblaze the honour that thy master got .
iden , farewell , and be proud of thy victory .
tell kent from me , she hath lost her best man , and exhort all the world to be cowards , for i , that never feared any , am vanquished by famine , not by valour .
dies how much thou me , heaven be my judge .
die , damned wretch , the curse of her that bare thee , and as i thrust thy body in with my sword , so wish i , i might thrust thy soul to hell .
hence will i drag thee headlong by the heels unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave , and there cut off thy most ungracious head , which i will bear in triumph to the king , leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon .

ah !
sancta majestas , who would not buy thee dear ?

enter buckingham whom have we here ?
buckingham , to disturb me ?
the king hath sent him , sure i must dissemble .
york , if thou meanest well , i greet thee well .
humphrey of buckingham , i accept thy greeting .
art thou a messenger , or come of pleasure ?
a messenger from henry , our dread liege , to know the reason of these arms in peace , or why thou , being a subject as i am , against thy oath and true allegiance sworn , should raise so great a power without his leave , or dare to bring thy force so near the court .
aside scarce can i speak , my choler is so great o , i could hew up rocks and fight with flint , i am so angry at these abject terms , and now , like ajax telamonius , on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury .
i am far better born than is the king , more like a king , more kingly in my thoughts but i must make fair weather yet a while , till henry be more weak and i more strong , buckingham , i prithee , pardon me , that i have given no answer all this while , my mind was troubled with deep melancholy .
the cause why i have brought this army hither is to remove proud somerset from the king , seditious to his grace and to the state .
that is too much presumption on thy part but if thy arms be to no other end , the king hath yielded unto thy demand the duke of somerset is in the tower .
upon thine honour , is he prisoner ?
upon mine honour , he is prisoner .
then , buckingham , i do dismiss my powers .
soldiers , i thank you all , disperse yourselves , meet me in george field , you shall have pay and every thing you wish .
and let my sovereign , virtuous henry , command my eldest son , nay , all my sons , as pledges of my fealty and love , i send them all as willing as i live lands , goods , horse , armour , any thing i have , is his to use , so somerset may die .

enter king henry vi and attendants buckingham , doth york intend no harm to us , that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm ?
in all submission and humility york doth present himself unto your highness .
then what intends these forces thou dost bring ?
to heave the traitor somerset from hence , and fight against that monstrous rebel cade , who since i heard to be discomfited .
enter iden , with cade head if one so rude and of so mean condition may pass into the presence of a king , lo , i present your grace a traitor head , the head of cade , whom i in combat slew .
the head of cade !
great god , how just art thou !
o , let me view his visage , being dead , that living wrought me such exceeding trouble .
tell me , my friend , art thou the man that slew him ?
i was , a like your majesty .
how art thou call ?
and what is thy degree ?
alexander iden , that my name , a poor esquire of kent , that loves his king .
so please it you , my lord , not amiss he were created knight for his good service .
iden , kneel down .

we give thee for reward a thousand marks , and will that thou henceforth attend on us .
may iden live to merit such a bounty .
and never live but true unto his liege !

for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head , but boldly stand and front him to his face .
how now !
is somerset at liberty ?
then , york , unloose thy thoughts , and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart .
shall i endure the sight of somerset ?
false king !
why hast thou broken faith with me , knowing how hardly i can brook abuse ?
king did i call thee ?
no , thou art not king , not fit to govern and rule multitudes , which darest not , no , nor canst not rule a traitor .
that head of thine doth not become a crown , thy hand is made to grasp a palmer staff , and not to grace an awful princely sceptre .
that gold must round engirt these brows of mine , whose smile and frown , like to achilles ' spear , is able with the change to kill and cure .
here is a hand to hold a sceptre up and with the same to act controlling laws .
give place by heaven , thou shalt rule no more him whom heaven created for thy ruler .
o monstrous traitor !
i arrest thee , york , of capital treason the king and crown , obey , audacious traitor , kneel for grace .
wouldst have me kneel ?
first let me ask of these , if they can brook i bow a knee to man .
sirrah , call in my sons to be my bail , exit attendant i know , ere they will have me go to ward , they pawn their swords for my enfranchisement .
call hither clifford !
bid him come amain , to say if that the bastard boys of york shall be the surety for their traitor father .
exit buckingham o neapolitan , outcast of naples , england bloody scourge !
the sons of york , thy betters in their birth , shall be their father bail , and bane to those that for my surety will refuse the boys !

enter clifford and young clifford and here comes clifford to deny their bail .
health and all happiness to my lord the king !
kneels i thank thee , clifford say , what news with thee ?
nay , do not fright us with an angry look , we are thy sovereign , clifford , kneel again , for thy mistaking so , we pardon thee .
this is my king , york , i do not mistake , but thou mistakest me much to think i do to bedlam with him !
is the man grown mad ?
ay , clifford , a bedlam and ambitious humour makes him oppose himself against his king .
he is a traitor , let him to the tower , and chop away that factious pate of his .
he is arrested , but will not obey , his sons , he says , shall give their words for him .
will you not , sons ?
ay , noble father , if our words will serve .
and if words will not , then our weapons shall .
why , what a brood of traitors have we here !
look in a glass , and call thy image so i am thy king , and thou a traitor .
call hither to the stake my two brave bears , that with the very shaking of their chains they may astonish these curs bid salisbury and warwick come to me .
enter the warwick and salisbury are these thy bears ?
we bait thy bears to death .
and manacle the in their chains , if thou darest bring them to the baiting place .
oft have i seen a hot cur run back and bite , because he was withheld , who , being suffer with the bear fell paw , hath clapp his tail between his legs and cried and such a piece of service will you do , if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick .
hence , heap of wrath , foul indigested lump , as crooked in thy manners as thy shape !
nay , we shall heat you thoroughly anon .
take heed , lest by your heat you burn yourselves .
why , warwick , hath thy knee forgot to bow ?
old salisbury , shame to thy silver hair , thou mad misleader of thy son !
what , wilt thou on thy play the ruffian , and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles ?
o , where is faith ?
o , where is loyalty ?
if it be banish from the frosty head , where shall it find a harbour in the earth ?
wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war , and shame thine honourable age with blood ?
why art thou old , and experience ?
or wherefore dost abuse it , if thou hast it ?
for shame !
in duty bend thy knee to me that bows unto the grave with mickle age .
my lord , i have consider with myself the title of this most renowned duke , and in my conscience do repute his grace the rightful heir to england royal seat .
hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me ?
i have .
canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath ?
it is great sin to swear unto a sin , but greater sin to keep a sinful oath .
who can be bound by any solemn vow to do a murderous deed , to rob a man , to force a spotless virgin chastity , to reave the orphan of his patrimony , to wring the widow from her custom right , and have no other reason for this wrong but that he was bound by a solemn oath ?
a subtle traitor needs no sophister .
call buckingham , and bid him arm himself .
call buckingham , and all the friends thou hast , i am resolved for death or dignity .
the first i warrant thee , if dreams prove true .
you were best to go to bed and dream again , to keep thee from the tempest of the field .
i am resolved to bear a greater storm than any thou canst conjure up , and that i write upon thy burgonet , might i but know thee by thy household badge .
now , by my father badge , old nevil crest , the rampant bear chain to the ragged staff , this day i wear aloft my burgonet , as on a mountain top the cedar shows that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm , even to affright thee with the view thereof .
and from thy burgonet i rend thy bear and tread it under foot with all contempt , despite the that protects the bear .
and so to arms , victorious father , to quell the rebels and their complices .
fie !
charity , for shame !
speak not in spite , for you shall sup with jesu christ .
foul stigmatic , that more than thou canst tell .
if not in heaven , you surely sup in hell .

seeing his dead father o , let the vile world end , and the premised flames of the last day knit earth and heaven together !
now let the general trumpet blow his blast , particularities and petty sounds to cease !
wast thou ordain , dear father , to lose thy youth in peace , and to achieve the silver livery of advised age , and , in thy reverence and thy , thus to die in ruffian battle ?
even at this sight my heart is turn to stone and while is mine , it shall be stony .
york not our old men spares , no more will i their babes tears virginal shall be to me even as the dew to fire , and beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax .
henceforth i will not have to do with pity meet i an infant of the house of york , into as many gobbets will i cut it as wild medea young absyrtus did in cruelty will i seek out my fame .
come , thou new ruin of old clifford house as did aeneas old anchises bear , so bear i thee upon my manly shoulders , but then aeneas bare a living load , nothing so heavy as these woes of mine .
exit , bearing off his father enter richard and somerset to fight .
somerset is killed so , lie thou there , for underneath an alehouse ' paltry sign , the castle in saint alban , somerset hath made the wizard famous in his death .

you are slow , for shame , away !
can we outrun the heavens ?
good margaret , stay .
what are you made of ?
you nor fight nor fly now is it manhood , wisdom and defence , to give the enemy way , and to secure us by what we can , which can no more but fly .
alarum afar off if you be , we then should see the bottom of all our fortunes but if we haply scape , as well we may , if not through your neglect , we shall to london get , where you are loved and where this breach now in our fortunes made may readily be stopp .
young clifford but that my heart on future mischief set , i would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly but fly you must , uncurable discomfit reigns in the hearts of all our present parts .
away , for your relief !
and we will live to see their day and them our fortune give away , my lord , away !

enter york , richard , warwick , and soldiers , with drum and colours of salisbury , who can report of him , that winter lion , who in rage forgets aged contusions and all brush of time , and , like a gallant in the brow of youth , repairs him with occasion ?
this happy day is not itself , nor have we won one foot , if salisbury be lost .
my noble father , three times i holp him to his horse , three times bestrid him , thrice i led him off , persuaded him from any further act but still , where danger was , still there i met him , and like rich hangings in a homely house , so was his will in his old feeble body .
but , noble as he is , look where he comes .
enter salisbury now , by my sword , well hast thou fought , by the mass , so did we all .
i thank you , richard god knows how long it is i have to live , and it hath pleased him that three times you have defended me from imminent death .
well , lords , we have not got that which we have is not enough our foes are this time fled , being opposites of such repairing nature .
i know our safety is to follow them , for , as i hear , the king is fled to london , to call a present court of parliament .
let us pursue him ere the writs go forth .
what says lord warwick ?
shall we after them ?
after them !
nay , before them , if we can .
now , by my faith , lords , was a glorious day saint alban battle won by famous york shall be eternized in all age to come .

enter york , edward , richard , norfolk , montague , warwick , and soldiers i wonder how the king escaped our hands .
while we pursued the horsemen of the north , he slily stole away and left his men whereat the great lord of northumberland , whose warlike ears could never brook retreat , cheer up the drooping army , and himself , lord clifford and lord stafford , all abreast , charged our main battle front , and breaking in were by the swords of common soldiers slain .
lord stafford father , duke of buckingham , is either slain or wounded dangerously , i cleft his beaver with a downright blow that this is true , father , behold his blood .
and , brother , here the earl of wiltshire blood , whom i encounter as the battles join .
speak thou for me and tell them what i did .
throwing down somerset head richard hath best deserved of all my sons .
but is your grace dead , my lord of somerset ?
such hope have all the line of john of gaunt !
thus do i hope to shake king henry head .
and so do victorious prince of york , before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps , i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close .
this is the palace of the fearful king , and this the regal seat possess it , york , for this is thine and not king henry heirs ' assist me , then , sweet warwick , and i will , for hither we have broken in by force .
we all assist you , he that flies shall die .
thanks , gentle norfolk stay by me , my lords , and , soldiers , stay and lodge by me this night .
they go up and when the king comes , offer no violence , unless he seek to thrust you out perforce .
the queen this day here holds her parliament , but little thinks we shall be of her council by words or blows here let us win our right .
arm as we are , let stay within this house .
the bloody parliament shall this be call , unless plantagenet , duke of york , be king , and bashful henry deposed , whose cowardice hath made us to our enemies .
then leave me not , my lords , be resolute , i mean to take possession of my right .
neither the king , nor he that loves him best , the proudest he that holds up lancaster , dares stir a wing , if warwick shake his bells .
i plant plantagenet , root him up who dares resolve thee , richard , claim the english crown .

enter king henry vi , clifford , northumberland , westmoreland , exeter , and the rest my lords , look where the sturdy rebel sits , even in the chair of state belike he means , back by the power of warwick , that false peer , to aspire unto the crown and reign as king .
earl of northumberland , he slew thy father .
and thine , lord clifford , and you both have vow revenge on him , his sons , his favourites and his friends .
if i be not , heavens be revenged on me !
the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel .
what , shall we suffer this ?
let pluck him down my heart for anger burns , i can not brook it .
be patient , gentle earl of westmoreland .
patience is for poltroons , such as he he durst not sit there , had your father lived .
my gracious lord , here in the parliament let us assail the family of york .
well hast thou spoken , cousin be it so .
ah , know you not the city favours them , and they have troops of soldiers at their beck ?
but when the duke is slain , they quickly fly .
far be the thought of this from henry heart , to make a shambles of the !
cousin of exeter , frowns , words and threats shall be the war that henry means to use .
thou factious duke of york , descend my throne , and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet , i am thy sovereign .
i am thine .
for shame , come down he made thee duke of york .
was my inheritance , as the earldom was .
thy father was a traitor to the crown .
exeter , thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry .
whom should he follow but his natural king ?
true , clifford , and that richard duke of york .
and shall i stand , and thou sit in my throne ?
it must and shall be so content thyself .
be duke of lancaster , let him be king .
he is both king and duke of lancaster , and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain .
and warwick shall disprove it .
you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers , and with colours spread march through the city to the palace gates .
yes , warwick , i remember it to my grief , and , by his soul , thou and thy house shall rue it .
plantagenet , of thee and these thy sons , thy kinsman and thy friends , i have more lives than drops of blood were in my father veins .
urge it no more , lest that , instead of words , i send thee , warwick , such a messenger as shall revenge his death before i stir .
poor clifford !
how i scorn his worthless threats !
will you we show our title to the crown ?
if not , our swords shall plead it in the field .
what title hast thou , traitor , to the crown ?
thy father was , as thou art , duke of york , thy grandfather , roger mortimer , earl of march i am the son of henry the fifth , who made the dauphin and the french to stoop and seized upon their towns and provinces .
talk not of france , sith thou hast lost it all .
the lord protector lost it , and not i when i was crown i was but nine months old .
you are old enough now , and yet , methinks , you lose .
father , tear the crown from the usurper head .
sweet father , do so , set it on your head .
good brother , as thou lovest and honourest arms , let fight it out and not stand cavilling thus .
sound drums and trumpets , and the king will fly .
sons , peace !
peace , thou !
and give king henry leave to speak .
plantagenet shall speak first hear him , lords , and be you silent and attentive too , for he that interrupts him shall not live .
thou that i will leave my kingly throne , wherein my grandsire and my father sat ?
no first shall war unpeople this my realm , ay , and their colours , often borne in france , and now in england to our heart great sorrow , shall be my .
why faint you , lords ?
my title good , and better far than his .
prove it , henry , and thou shalt be king .
henry the fourth by conquest got the crown .
was by rebellion against his king .
aside i know not what to say , my title tell me , may not a king adopt an heir ?
what then ?
an if he may , then am i lawful king , for richard , in the view of many lords , resign the crown to henry the fourth , whose heir my father was , and i am his .
he rose against him , being his sovereign , and made him to resign his crown perforce .
suppose , my lords , he did it unconstrain , think you prejudicial to his crown ?
no , for he could not so resign his crown but that the next heir should succeed and reign .
art thou against us , duke of exeter ?
his is the right , and therefore pardon me .
why whisper you , my lords , and answer not ?
my conscience tells me he is lawful king .
aside all will revolt from me , and turn to him .
plantagenet , for all the claim thou , think not that henry shall be so deposed .
deposed he shall be , in despite of all .
thou art deceived is not thy southern power , of essex , norfolk , suffolk , nor of kent , which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud , can set the duke up in despite of me .
king henry , be thy title right or wrong , lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence may that ground gape and swallow me alive , where i shall kneel to him that slew my father !
o clifford , how thy words revive my heart !
henry of lancaster , resign thy crown .
what mutter you , or what conspire you , lords ?
do right unto this princely duke of york , or i will fill the house with armed men , and over the chair of state , where now he sits , write up his title with usurping blood .
he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves my lord of warwick , hear me but one word let me for this my reign as king .
confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs , and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest .
i am content richard plantagenet , enjoy the kingdom after my decease .
what wrong is this unto the prince your son !
what good is this to england and himself !
base , fearful and despairing henry !
how hast thou injured both thyself and us !
i can not stay to hear these articles .
nor i .
come , cousin , let us tell the queen these news .
farewell , and degenerate king , in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides .
be thou a prey unto the house of york , and die in bands for this unmanly deed !
in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome , or live in peace abandon and despised !
exeunt northumberland , clifford , and westmoreland turn this way , henry , and regard them not .
they seek revenge and therefore will not yield .
ah , exeter !
why should you sigh , my lord ?
not for myself , lord warwick , but my son , whom i unnaturally shall disinherit .
but be it as it may i here entail the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever , conditionally , that here thou take an oath to cease this civil war , and , whilst i live , to honour me as thy king and sovereign , and neither by treason nor hostility to seek to put me down and reign thyself .
this oath i willingly take and will perform .
long live king henry !
plantagenet embrace him .
and long live thou and these thy forward sons !
now york and lancaster are reconciled .
accursed be he that seeks to make them foes !

enter queen margaret and prince edward here comes the queen , whose looks bewray her anger i steal away .
exeter , so will i .
nay , go not from me , i will follow thee .
be patient , gentle queen , and i will stay .
who can be patient in such extremes ?
ah , wretched man !
would i had died a maid and never seen thee , never borne thee son , seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus ?
hadst thou but loved him half so well as i , or felt that pain which i did for him once , or nourish him as i did with my blood , thou wouldst have left thy dearest there , rather than have that savage duke thine heir and disinherited thine only son .
father , you can not disinherit me if you be king , why should not i succeed ?
pardon me , margaret , pardon me , sweet son the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me .
enforced thee !
art thou king , and wilt be forced ?
i shame to hear thee speak .
ah , timorous wretch !
thou hast undone thyself , thy son and me , and given unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance .
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown , what is it , but to make thy sepulchre and creep into it far before thy time ?
warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais , stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas , the duke is made protector of the realm , and yet shalt thou be safe ?
such safety finds the trembling lamb environed with wolves .
had i been there , which am a silly woman , the soldiers should have toss me on their pikes before i would have granted to that act .
but thou thy life before thine honour and seeing thou dost , i here divorce myself both from thy table , henry , and thy bed , until that act of parliament be repeal whereby my son is disinherited .
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours will follow mine , if once they see them spread , and spread they shall be , to thy foul disgrace and utter ruin of the house of york .
thus do i leave thee .
come , son , let away , our army is ready , come , we after them .
stay , gentle margaret , and hear me speak .
thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone .
gentle son edward , thou wilt stay with me ?
ay , to be murder by his enemies .
when i return with victory from the field i see your grace till then i follow her .
come , son , away , we may not linger thus .
exeunt queen margaret and prince edward poor queen !
how love to me and to her son hath made her break out into terms of rage !
revenged may she be on that hateful duke , whose haughty spirit , winged with desire , will cost my crown , and like an empty eagle tire on the flesh of me and of my son !
the loss of those three lords torments my heart i write unto them and entreat them fair .
come , cousin you shall be the messenger .
and i , i hope , shall reconcile them all .
exeunt scene ii .
sandal castle .
enter richard , edward , and montague brother , though i be youngest , give me leave .
no , i can better play the orator .
but i have reasons strong and forcible .
enter york why , how now , sons and brother !
at a strife ?
what is your quarrel ?
how began it first ?
no quarrel , but a slight contention .
about what ?
about that which concerns your grace and us , the crown of england , father , which is yours .
mine boy ?
not till king henry be dead .
your right depends not on his life or death .
now you are heir , therefore enjoy it now by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe , it will outrun you , father , in the end .
i took an oath that he should quietly reign .
but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year .
no , god forbid your grace should be forsworn .
i shall be , if i claim by open war .
i prove the contrary , if you hear me speak .
thou canst not , son , it is impossible .
an oath is of no moment , being not took before a true and lawful magistrate , that hath authority over him that swears henry had none , but did usurp the place , then , seeing was he that made you to depose , your oath , my lord , is vain and frivolous .
therefore , to arms !
and , father , do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown , within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy .
why do we finger thus ?
i can not rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henry heart .
richard , enough , i will be king , or die .
brother , thou shalt to london presently , and whet on warwick to this enterprise .
thou , richard , shalt to the duke of norfolk , and tell him privily of our intent .
you edward , shall unto my lord cobham , with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise in them i trust , for they are soldiers , witty , courteous , liberal , full of spirit .
while you are thus employ , what resteth more , but that i seek occasion how to rise , and yet the king not privy to my drift , nor any of the house of lancaster ?
enter a messenger but , stay what news ?
why comest thou in such post ?
the queen with all the northern earls and lords intend here to besiege you in your castle she is hard by with twenty thousand men , and therefore fortify your hold , my lord .
ay , with my sword .
what !
thou that we fear them ?
edward and richard , you shall stay with me , my brother montague shall post to london let noble warwick , cobham , and the rest , whom we have left protectors of the king , with powerful policy strengthen themselves , and trust not simple henry nor his oaths .
brother , i go , i win them , fear it not and thus most humbly i do take my leave .
exit enter john mortimer and hugh mortimer sir john and sir hugh mortimer , mine uncles , you are come to sandal in a happy hour , the army of the queen mean to besiege us .
she shall not need , we meet her in the field .
what , with five thousand men ?
ay , with five hundred , father , for a need a woman general , what should we fear ?
a march afar off i hear their drums let set our men in order , and issue forth and bid them battle straight .
five men to twenty !
though the odds be great , i doubt not , uncle , of our victory .
many a battle have i won in france , when as the enemy hath been ten to one why should i not now have the like success ?

and i , my lord , will bear him company .
soldiers , away with him !
ah , clifford , murder not this innocent child , lest thou be hated both of god and man !
exit , dragged off by soldiers how now !
is he dead already ?
or is it fear that makes him close his eyes ?
i open them .
so looks the lion the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws , and so he walks , insulting his prey , and so he comes , to rend his limbs asunder .
ah , gentle clifford , kill me with thy sword , and not with such a cruel threatening look .
sweet clifford , hear me speak before i die .
i am too mean a subject for thy wrath be thou revenged on men , and let me live .
in vain thou , poor boy , my father blood hath stopp the passage where thy words should enter .
then let my father blood open it again he is a man , and , clifford , cope with him .
had thy brethren here , their lives and thine were not revenge sufficient for me , no , if i digg up thy forefathers ' graves and hung their rotten coffins up in chains , it could not slake mine ire , nor ease my heart .
the sight of any of the house of york is as a fury to torment my soul , and till i root out their accursed line and leave not one alive , i live in hell .
therefore lifting his hand o , let me pray before i take my death !
to thee i pray , sweet clifford , pity me !
such pity as my rapier point affords .
i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me ?
thy father hath .
but was ere i was born .
thou hast one son , for his sake pity me , lest in revenge thereof , sith god is just , he be as miserably slain as i .
ah , let me live in prison all my days , and when i give occasion of offence , then let me die , for now thou hast no cause .
no cause !
thy father slew my father , therefore , die .
stabs him di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae !
dies plantagenet !
i come , plantagenet !
and this thy son blood cleaving to my blade shall rust upon my weapon , till thy blood , congeal with this , do make me wipe off both .

my sons , god knows what hath bechanced them but this i know , they have demean themselves like men born to renown by life or death .
three times did richard make a lane to me .
and thrice cried , father !
fight it out ! '
and full as oft came edward to my side , with purple falchion , painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encounter him and when the hardiest warriors did retire , richard cried !
and give no foot of ground ! '
and cried ' a crown , or else a glorious tomb !
a sceptre , or an earthly sepulchre ! '
with this , we charged again but , out , alas !
we bodged again , as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with waves .
a short alarum within ah , hark !
the fatal followers do pursue , and i am faint and can not fly their fury and were i strong , i would not shun their fury the sands are number that make up my life , here must i stay , and here my life must end .
enter queen margaret , clifford , northumberland , prince edward , and soldiers come , bloody clifford , rough northumberland , i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt , and i abide your shot .
yield to our mercy , proud plantagenet .
ay , to such mercy as his ruthless arm , with downright payment , show unto my father .
now phaethon hath tumbled from his car , and made an evening at the noontide prick .
my ashes , as the phoenix , may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven , scorning you can afflict me with .
why come you not ?
what !
multitudes , and fear ?
so cowards fight when they can fly no further , so doves do peck the falcon piercing talons , so desperate thieves , all hopeless of their lives , breathe out invectives the officers .
o clifford , but bethink thee once again , and in thy thought my former time , and , if though canst for blushing , view this face , and bite thy tongue , that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this !
i will not bandy with thee word for word , but buckle with thee blows , twice two for one .
hold , valiant clifford !
for a thousand causes i would prolong awhile the traitor life .
wrath makes him deaf speak thou , northumberland .
hold , clifford !
do not honour him so much to prick thy finger , though to wound his heart what valour were it , when a cur doth grin , for one to thrust his hand between his teeth , when he might spurn him with his foot away ?
it is war prize to take all vantages , and ten to one is no impeach of valour .
they lay hands on york , who struggles ay , ay , so strives the woodcock with the gin .
so doth the cony struggle in the net .
so triumph thieves upon their conquer booty , so true men yield , with robbers so .
what would your grace have done unto him now ?
brave warriors , clifford and northumberland , come , make him stand upon this molehill here , that raught at mountains with outstretched arms , yet parted but the shadow with his hand .
what !
was it you that would be england king ?
you that revell in our parliament , and made a preachment of your high descent ?
where are your mess of sons to back you now ?
the wanton edward , and the lusty george ?
and where that valiant prodigy , dicky your boy , that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies ?
or , with the rest , where is your darling rutland ?
look , york i stain this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford , with his rapier point , made issue from the bosom of the boy , and if thine eyes can water for his death , i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal .
alas poor york !
but that i hate thee deadly , i should lament thy miserable state .
i prithee , grieve , to make me merry , york .
what , hath thy fiery heart so parch thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutland death ?
why art thou patient , man ?
thou shouldst be mad , and i , to make thee mad , do mock thee thus .
stamp , rave , and fret , that i may sing and dance .
thou wouldst be fee , i see , to make me sport york can not speak , unless he wear a crown .
a crown for york !
and , lords , bow low to him hold you his hands , whilst i do set it on .
putting a paper crown on his head ay , marry , sir , now looks he like a king !
ay , this is he that took king henry chair , and this is he was his adopted heir .
but how is it that great plantagenet is crown so soon , and broke his solemn oath ?
as i bethink me , you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death .
and will you pale your head in henry glory , and rob his temples of the diadem , now in his life , against your holy oath ?
o , is a fault too too unpardonable !
off with the crown , and with the crown his head , and , whilst we breathe , take time to do him dead .
that is my office , for my father sake .
nay , stay , lets hear the orisons he makes .
of france , but worse than wolves of france , whose tongue more poisons than the adder tooth !
how is it in thy sex to triumph , like an amazonian trull , upon their woes whom fortune captivates !
but that thy face is , , unchanging , made impudent with use of evil deeds , i would assay , proud queen , to make thee blush .
to tell thee whence thou camest , of whom derived , were shame enough to shame thee , wert thou not shameless .
thy father bears the type of king of naples , of both the sicils and jerusalem , yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman .
hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult ?
it needs not , nor it boots thee not , proud queen , unless the adage must be verified , that beggars mounted run their horse to death .
is beauty that doth oft make women proud , but , god he knows , thy share thereof is small is virtue that doth make them most admired , the contrary doth make thee wonder at is government that makes them seem divine , the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us , or as the south to the septentrion .
o tiger heart wrapt in a woman hide !
how couldst thou drain the of the child , to bid the father wipe his eyes withal , and yet be seen to bear a woman face ?
women are soft , mild , pitiful and flexible , thou stern , obdurate , flinty , rough , remorseless .
thou me rage ?
why , now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep ?
why , now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers , and when the rage allays , the rain begins .
these tears are my sweet rutland obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death , thee , fell clifford , and thee , false frenchwoman .
beshrew me , but his passion moves me so that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears .
that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touch , would not have stain with blood but you are more inhuman , more inexorable , o , ten times more , than tigers of hyrcania .
see , ruthless queen , a hapless father tears this cloth thou in blood of my sweet boy , and i with tears do wash the blood away .
keep thou the napkin , and go boast of this and if thou the heavy story right , upon my soul , the hearers will shed tears , yea even my foes will shed tears , and say , it was a piteous deed ! '
there , take the crown , and , with the crown , my curse , and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand !
clifford , take me from the world my soul to heaven , my blood upon your heads !
had he been to all my kin , i should not for my life but weep with him .
to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul .
what , , my lord northumberland ?
think but upon the wrong he did us all , and that will quickly dry thy melting tears .
here for my oath , here for my father death .
stabbing him and here to right our king .
stabbing him open thy gate of mercy , gracious god !
my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee .
dies off with his head , and set it on york gates , so york may overlook the town of york .

enter edward , richard , and their power i wonder how our princely father , or whether he be away or no from clifford and northumberland pursuit had he been , we should have heard the news , had he been slain , we should have heard the news , or had he , methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape .
how fares my brother ?
why is he so sad ?
i can not joy , until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become .
i saw him in the battle range about , and watch him how he singled clifford forth .
methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat , or as a bear , encompass round with dogs , who having pinch a few and made them cry , the rest stand all aloof , and bark at him .
so fared our father with his enemies , so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks , is prize enough to be his son .
see how the morning opes her golden gates , and takes her farewell of the glorious sun !
how well resembles it the prime of youth , trimm like a younker prancing to his love !

three glorious suns , each one a perfect sun , not separated with the racking clouds , but sever in a pale sky .
see , see !
they join , embrace , and seem to kiss , as if they vow some league inviolable now are they but one lamp , one light , one sun .
in this the heaven figures some event .
is wondrous strange , the like yet never heard of .
i think it cites us , brother , to the field , that we , the sons of brave plantagenet , each one already blazing by our meeds , should notwithstanding join our lights together and the earth as this the world .
it bodes , henceforward will i bear upon my target three suns .
nay , bear three daughters by your leave i speak it , you love the breeder better than the male .
enter a messenger but what art thou , whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue ?
ah , one that was a woful when as the noble duke of york was slain , your princely father and my loving lord !
o , speak no more , for i have heard too much .
say how he died , for i will hear it all .
environed he was with many foes , and stood against them , as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enter troy .
but hercules himself must yield to odds , and many strokes , though with a little axe , hew down and fell the oak .
by many hands your father was subdued , but only slaughter by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen , who crown the gracious duke in high despite , laugh in his face , and when with grief he wept , the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland , by rough clifford slain and after many scorns , many foul taunts , they took his head , and on the gates of york they set the same , and there it doth remain , the saddest spectacle that i view .
sweet duke of york , our prop to lean upon , now thou art gone , we have no staff , no stay .
o clifford , boisterous clifford !
thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry , and treacherously hast thou vanquish him , for hand to hand he would have vanquish thee .
now my soul palace is become a prison ah , would she break from hence , that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest !
for never henceforth shall i joy again , never , o never shall i see more joy !
i can not weep , for all my body moisture scarce serves to quench my heart nor can my tongue unload my heart great burthen , for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast , and burns me up with flames that tears would quench .
to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes , blows and revenge for me richard , i bear thy name , i venge thy death , or die renowned by attempting it .
his name that valiant duke hath left with thee , his dukedom and his chair with me is left .
nay , if thou be that princely eagle bird , show thy descent by gazing the sun for chair and dukedom , throne and kingdom say , either that is thine , or else thou wert not his .
march .
enter warwick , montague , and their army how now , fair lords !
what fare ?
what news abroad ?
great lord of warwick , if we should recount our baleful news , and at each word deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told , the words would add more anguish than the wounds .
o valiant lord , the duke of york is slain !
o warwick , warwick !
that plantagenet , which held three dearly as his soul redemption , is by the stern lord clifford done to death .
ten days ago i drown these news in tears , and now , to add more measure to your woes , i come to tell you things sith then .
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought , where your brave father breathed his latest gasp , tidings , as swiftly as the posts could run , were brought me of your loss and his depart .
i , then in london keeper of the king , muster my soldiers , gather flocks of friends , and very well appointed , as i thought , march toward saint alban to intercept the queen , bearing the king in my behalf along , for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry oath and your succession .
short tale to make , we at saint alban met our battles join , and both sides fiercely fought but whether was the coldness of the king , who look full gently on his warlike queen , that robb my soldiers of their heated spleen , or whether was report of her success , or more than common fear of clifford rigour , who thunders to his captives blood and death , i can not judge but to conclude with truth , their weapons like to lightning came and went , our soldiers ' , like the lazy flight , or like an idle thresher with a flail , fell gently down , as if they struck their friends .
i cheer them up with justice of our cause , with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain , they had no heart to fight , and we in them no hope to win the day , so that we fled , the king unto the queen , lord george your brother , norfolk and myself , in haste , , are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were , making another head to fight again .
where is the duke of norfolk , gentle warwick ?
and when came george from burgundy to england ?
some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers , and for your brother , he was lately sent from your kind aunt , duchess of burgundy , with aid of soldiers to this needful war .
was odds , belike , when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit , but till now his scandal of retire .
nor now my scandal , richard , dost thou hear , for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry head , and wring the awful sceptre from his fist , were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness , peace , and prayer .
i know it well , lord warwick , blame me not is love i bear thy glories makes me speak .
but in this troublous time what to be done ?
shall we go throw away our coats of steel , and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns , numbering our with our beads ?
or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms ?
if for the last , say ay , and to it , lords .
why , therefore warwick came to seek you out , and therefore comes my brother montague .
attend me , lords .
the proud insulting queen , with clifford and the haught northumberland , and of their feather many more proud birds , have wrought the king like wax .
he swore consent to your succession , his oath enrolled in the parliament , and now to london all the crew are gone , to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster .
their power , i think , is thirty thousand strong now , if the help of norfolk and myself , with all the friends that thou , brave earl of march , amongst the loving welshmen canst procure , will but amount to five and twenty thousand , why , via !
to london will we march amain , and once again bestride our foaming steeds , and once again cry upon our foes ! '
but never once again turn back and fly .
ay , now methinks i hear great warwick speak may he live to see a sunshine day , that cries , ' if warwick bid him stay .
lord warwick , on thy shoulder will i lean , and when thou as god forbid the hour ! must edward fall , which peril heaven forfend !
no longer earl of march , but duke of york the next degree is england royal throne , for king of england shalt thou be proclaim in every borough as we pass along , and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head .
king edward , valiant richard , montague , stay we no longer , dreaming of renown , but sound the trumpets , and about our task .
then , clifford , were thy heart as hard as steel , as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds , i come to pierce it , or to give thee mine .
then strike up drums god and saint george for us !
enter a messenger how now !
what news ?
the duke of norfolk sends you word by me , the queen is coming with a puissant host , and craves your company for speedy counsel .
why then it sorts , brave warriors , let away .
exeunt scene ii .
before york .
flourish .
enter king henry vi , queen margaret , prince edward , clifford , and northumberland , with drum and trumpets welcome , my lord , to this brave town of york .
yonder the head of that that sought to be encompass with your crown doth not the object cheer your heart , my lord ?
ay , as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck to see this sight , it irks my very soul .
withhold revenge , dear god !
is not my fault , nor wittingly have i infringed my vow .
my gracious liege , this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside .
to whom do lions cast their gentle looks ?
not to the beast that would usurp their den .
whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick ?
not his that spoils her young before her face .
who the lurking serpent mortal sting ?
not he that sets his foot upon her back .
the smallest worm will turn being trodden on , and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood .
ambitious york doth level at thy crown , thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he , but a duke , would have his son a king , and raise his issue , like a loving sire , thou , being a king , blest with a goodly son , didst yield consent to disinherit him , which argued thee a most unloving father .
unreasonable creatures feed their young , and though man face be fearful to their eyes , yet , in protection of their tender ones , who hath not seen them , even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight , make war with him that climb unto their nest , offer their own lives in their young defence ?
for shame , my liege , make them your precedent !
were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his father fault , and long hereafter say unto his child , my and his grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away ' ?
ah , what a shame were this !
look on the boy , and let his manly face , which promiseth successful fortune , steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him .
full well hath clifford play the orator , inferring arguments of mighty force .
but , clifford , tell me , didst thou never hear that things had ever bad success ?
and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell ?
i leave my son my virtuous deeds behind , and would my father had left me no more !
for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a more care to keep than in possession and jot of pleasure .
ah , cousin york !
would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here !
my lord , cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh , and this soft courage makes your followers faint .
you promised knighthood to our forward son unsheathe your sword , and dub him presently .
edward , kneel down .
edward plantagenet , arise a knight , and learn this lesson , draw thy sword in right .
my gracious father , by your kingly leave , i draw it as apparent to the crown , and in that quarrel use it to the death .
why , that is spoken like a toward prince .
enter a messenger royal commanders , be in readiness for with a band of thirty thousand men comes warwick , backing of the duke of york , and in the towns , as they do march along , proclaims him king , and many fly to him darraign your battle , for they are at hand .
i would your highness would depart the field the queen hath best success when you are absent .
ay , good my lord , and leave us to our fortune .
why , that my fortune too , therefore i stay .
be it with resolution then to fight .
my royal father , cheer these noble lords and hearten those that fight in your defence unsheathe your sword , good father , cry george ! '
march .
enter edward , george , richard , warwick , norfolk , montague , and soldiers now , perjured henry !
wilt thou kneel for grace , and set thy diadem upon my head , or bide the mortal fortune of the field ?
go , rate thy minions , proud insulting boy !
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king ?
i am his king , and he should bow his knee , i was adopted heir by his consent since when , his oath is broke , for , as i hear , you , that are king , though he do wear the crown , have caused him , by new act of parliament , to blot out me , and put his own son in .
and reason too who should succeed the father but the son ?
are you there , butcher ?
o , i can not speak !
ay , , here i stand to answer thee , or any he the proudest of thy sort .
was you that kill young rutland , was it not ?
ay , and old york , and yet not satisfied .
for god sake , lords , give signal to the fight .
what thou , henry , wilt thou yield the crown ?
why , how now , warwick !
dare you speak ?
when you and i met at saint alban last , your legs did better service than your hands .
then was my turn to fly , and now is thine .
you said so much before , and yet you fled .
was not your valour , clifford , drove me thence .
no , nor your manhood that durst make you stay .
northumberland , i hold thee reverently .
break off the parley , for scarce i can refrain the execution of my heart upon that clifford , that cruel .
i slew thy father , thou him a child ?
ay , like a dastard and a treacherous coward , as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland , but ere sunset i make thee curse the deed .
have done with words , my lords , and hear me speak .
defy them then , or else hold close thy lips .
i prithee , give no limits to my tongue i am a king , and privileged to speak .
my liege , the wound that bred this meeting here can not be cured by words , therefore be still .
then , executioner , unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all , i am resolved that clifford manhood lies upon his tongue .
say , henry , shall i have my right , or no ?
a thousand men have broke their fasts , that shall dine unless thou yield the crown .
if thou deny , their blood upon thy head , for york in justice puts his armour on .
if that be right which warwick says is right , there is no wrong , but every thing is right .
whoever got thee , there thy mother stands , for , well i wot , thou hast thy mother tongue .
but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam , but like a foul stigmatic , mark by the destinies to be avoided , as venom toads , or lizards ' dreadful stings .
iron of naples hid with english gilt , whose father bears the title of a king , as if a channel should be call the sea , shamest thou not , knowing whence thou art extraught , to let thy tongue detect thy heart ?
a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns , to make this shameless callet know herself .
helen of greece was fairer far than thou , although thy husband may be menelaus , and was agamemnon brother wrong by that false woman , as this king by thee .
his father revell in the heart of france , and tamed the king , and made the dauphin stoop , and had he match according to his state , he might have kept that glory to this day , but when he took a beggar to his bed , and graced thy poor sire with his , even then that sunshine brew a shower for him , that wash his father fortunes forth of france , and heap sedition on his crown at home .
for what hath broach this tumult but thy pride ?
hadst thou been meek , our title still had slept , and we , in pity of the gentle king , had slipp our claim until another age .
but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring , and that thy summer bred us no increase , we set the axe to thy usurping root , and though the edge hath something hit ourselves , yet , know thou , since we have begun to strike , we never leave till we have hewn thee down , or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods .
and , in this resolution , i defy thee , not willing any longer conference , since thou deniest the gentle king to speak .
sound trumpets !
let our bloody colours wave !
and either victory , or else a grave .
stay , edward .
no , wrangling woman , we no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day .

or strike , ungentle death !
for this world frowns , and edward sun is clouded .
how now , my lord !
what hap ?
what hope of good ?
enter george our hap is loss , our hope but sad despair , our ranks are broke , and ruin follows us what counsel give you ?
whither shall we fly ?
bootless is flight , they follow us with wings , and weak we are and can not shun pursuit .
enter richard ah , warwick , why hast thou withdrawn thyself ?
thy brother blood the thirsty earth hath drunk , broach with the steely point of clifford lance , and in the very pangs of death he cried , like to a dismal clangour heard from far , , revenge !
brother , revenge my death ! '
so , underneath the belly of their steeds , that stain their fetlocks in his smoking blood , the noble gentleman gave up the ghost .
then let the earth be drunken with our blood i kill my horse , because i will not fly .
why stand we like women here , wailing our losses , whiles the foe doth rage , and look upon , as if the tragedy were play in jest by counterfeiting actors ?
here on my knee i vow to god above , i never pause again , never stand still , till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge .
o warwick , i do bend my knee with thine , and in this vow do chain my soul to thine !
and , ere my knee rise from the earth cold face , i throw my hands , mine eyes , my heart to thee , thou setter up and plucker down of kings , beseeching thee , if with they will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey , yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope , and give sweet passage to my sinful soul !
now , lords , take leave until we meet again , it be , in heaven or in earth .
brother , give me thy hand , and , gentle warwick , let me embrace thee in my weary arms i , that did never weep , now melt with woe that winter should cut off our so .
away , away !
once more , sweet lords farewell .
yet let us all together to our troops , and give them leave to fly that will not stay , and call them pillars that will stand to us , and , if we thrive , promise them such rewards as victors wear at the olympian games this may plant courage in their quailing breasts , for yet is hope of life and victory .
forslow no longer , make we hence amain .

exeunt scene another part of the field .
alarum .
enter king henry vi alone this battle fares like to the morning war , when dying clouds contend with growing light , what time the shepherd , blowing of his nails , can neither call it perfect day nor night .
now sways it this way , like a mighty sea forced by the tide to combat with the wind , now sways it that way , like the selfsame sea forced to retire by fury of the wind sometime the flood prevails , and then the wind , now one the better , then another best , both tugging to be victors , breast to breast , yet neither conqueror nor conquered so is the equal of this fell war .
here on this molehill will i sit me down .
to whom god will , there be the victory !
for margaret my queen , and clifford too , have chid me from the battle , swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence .
would i were dead !
if god good will were so , for what is in this world but grief and woe ?
o god !
methinks it were a happy life , to be no better than a homely swain , to sit upon a hill , as i do now , to carve out dials quaintly , point by point , thereby to see the minutes how they run , how many make the hour full complete , how many hours bring about the day , how many days will finish up the year , how many years a mortal man may live .
when this is known , then to divide the times so many hours must i tend my flock , so many hours must i take my rest , so many hours must i contemplate , so many hours must i sport myself , so many days my ewes have been with young , so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean so many years ere i shall shear the fleece so minutes , hours , days , months , and years , pass over to the end they were created , would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave .
ah , what a life were this !
how sweet !
how lovely !
gives not the a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep , than doth a rich embroider canopy to kings that fear their subjects ' treachery ?
o , yes , it doth , a it doth .
and to conclude , the shepherd homely curds , his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle .
his wonted sleep under a fresh tree shade , all which secure and sweetly he enjoys , is far beyond a prince delicates , his viands sparkling in a golden cup , his body couched in a curious bed , when care , mistrust , and treason waits on him .

this man , whom hand to hand i slew in fight , may be possessed with some store of crowns , and i , that haply take them from him now , may yet ere night yield both my life and them to some man else , as this dead man doth me .
who this ?
o god !
it is my father face , whom in this conflict i unwares have kill .
o heavy times , begetting such events !
from london by the king was i press forth , my father , being the earl of warwick man , came on the part of york , press by his master , and i , who at his hands received my life , him have by my hands of life bereaved him .
pardon me , god , i knew not what i did !
and pardon , father , for i knew not thee !
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks , and no more words till they have flow their fill .
o piteous spectacle !
o bloody times !
whiles lions war and battle for their dens , poor harmless lambs abide their enmity .
weep , wretched man , i aid thee tear for tear , and let our hearts and eyes , like civil war , be blind with tears , and break with grief .
enter a father that has killed his son , bringing in the body thou that so stoutly hast resisted me , give me thy gold , if thou hast any gold for i have bought it with an hundred blows .
but let me see is this our foeman face ?
ah , no , no , no , it is mine only son !
ah , boy , if any life be left in thee , throw up thine eye !
see , see what showers arise , blown with the windy tempest of my heart , upon thy words , that kill mine eye and heart !
o , pity , god , this miserable age !
what stratagems , how fell , how butcherly , erroneous , mutinous and unnatural , this deadly quarrel daily doth beget !
o boy , thy father gave thee life too soon , and hath bereft thee of thy life too late !
woe above woe !
grief more than common grief !
o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds !
o pity , pity , gentle heaven , pity !
the red rose and the white are on his face , the fatal colours of our striving houses the one his purple blood right well resembles , the other his pale cheeks , methinks , presenteth wither one rose , and let the other flourish , if you contend , a thousand lives must wither .
how will my mother for a father death take on with me and be satisfied !
how will my wife for slaughter of my son shed seas of tears and be satisfied !
how will the country for these woful chances misthink the king and not be satisfied !
was ever son so rued a father death ?
was ever father so bemoan his son ?
was ever king so grieved for subjects ' woe ?
much is your sorrow , mine ten times so much .
i bear thee hence , where i may weep my fill .
exit with the body these arms of mine shall be thy , my heart , sweet boy , shall be thy sepulchre , for from my heart thine image shall go , my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell , and so obsequious will thy father be , even for the loss of thee , having no more , as priam was for all his valiant sons .
i bear thee hence , and let them fight that will , for i have murdered where i should not kill .

o lancaster , i fear thy overthrow more than my body parting with my soul !
my love and fear glued many friends to thee , and , now i fall , thy tough commixture melts .
impairing henry , strengthening misproud york , the common people swarm like summer flies , and whither fly the gnats but to the sun ?
and who shines now but henry enemies ?
o phoebus , hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds , thy burning car never had scorch the earth !
and , henry , hadst thou sway as kings should do , or as thy father and his father did , giving no ground unto the house of york , they never then had sprung like summer flies , i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death , and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace .
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air ?
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity ?
bootless are plaints , and cureless are my wounds , no way to fly , nor strength to hold out flight the foe is merciless , and will not pity , for at their hands i have deserved no pity .
the air hath got into my deadly wounds , and much effuse of blood doth make me faint .
come , york and richard , warwick and the rest , i stabb your fathers ' bosoms , split my breast .

enter edward , george , richard , montague , warwick , and soldiers now breathe we , lords good fortune bids us pause , and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks .
some troops pursue the queen , that led calm henry , though he were a king , as doth a sail , fill with a fretting gust , command an argosy to stem the waves .
but think you , lords , that clifford fled with them ?
no , is impossible he should escape , for , though before his face i speak the words your brother richard mark him for the grave and he is , he surely dead .
clifford groans , and dies whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave ?
a deadly groan , like life and death departing .
see who it is and , now the battle ended , if friend or foe , let him be gently used .
revoke that doom of mercy , for is clifford , who not contented that he lopp the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth , but set his murdering knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring , i mean our princely father , duke of york .
from off the gates of york fetch down the head , your father head , which clifford placed there , instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answered .
bring forth that fatal to our house , that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound , and his tongue no more shall speak .
i think his understanding is bereft .
speak , clifford , dost thou know who speaks to thee ?
dark cloudy death his beams of life , and he nor sees nor hears us what we say .
o , would he did !
and so perhaps he doth is but his policy to counterfeit , because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father .
if so thou , vex him with eager words .
clifford , ask mercy and obtain no grace .
clifford , repent in bootless penitence .
clifford , devise excuses for thy faults .
while we devise fell tortures for thy faults .
thou didst love york , and i am son to york .
thou rutland , i will pity thee .
where captain margaret , to fence you now ?
they mock thee , clifford swear as thou wast wont .
what , not an oath ?
nay , then the world goes hard when clifford can not spare his friends an oath .
i know by that he dead , and , by my soul , if this right hand would buy two hour life , that i in all despite might rail at him , this hand should chop it off , and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy .
ay , but he dead off with the traitor head , and rear it in the place your father stands .
and now to london with triumphant march , there to be crowned england royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france , and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together , and , having france thy friend , thou shalt not dread the scatter foe that hopes to rise again , for though they can not greatly sting to hurt , yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears .
first will i see the coronation , and then to brittany i cross the sea , to effect this marriage , so it please my lord .
even as thou wilt , sweet warwick , let it be , for in thy shoulder do i build my seat , and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting .
richard , i will create thee duke of gloucester , and george , of clarence warwick , as ourself , shall do and undo as him pleaseth best .
let me be duke of clarence , george of gloucester , for gloucester dukedom is too ominous .

that can not be , the noise of thy will scare the herd , and so my shoot is lost .
here stand we both , and aim we at the best and , for the time shall not seem tedious , i tell thee what befell me on a day in this where now we mean to stand .
here comes a man , let stay till he be past .
enter king henry vi , disguised , with a prayerbook from scotland am i , even of pure love , to greet mine own land with my wishful sight .
no , harry , harry , is no land of thine , thy place is fill , thy sceptre wrung from thee , thy balm wash off wherewith thou wast anointed no bending knee will call thee caesar now , no humble suitors press to speak for right , no , not a man comes for redress of thee , for how can i help them , and not myself ?
ay , here a deer whose skin a keeper fee this is the quondam king , let seize upon him .
let me embrace thee , sour adversity , for wise men say it is the wisest course .
why linger we ?
let us lay hands upon him .
forbear awhile , we hear a little more .
my queen and son are gone to france for aid , and , as i hear , the great commanding warwick is thither gone , to crave the french king sister to wife for edward if this news be true , poor queen and son , your labour is but lost , for warwick is a subtle orator , and lewis a prince soon won with moving words .
by this account then margaret may win him , for she a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a battery in his breast , her tears will pierce into a marble heart , the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn , and nero will be tainted with remorse , to hear and see her plaints , her brinish tears .
ay , but she come to beg , warwick to give , she , on his left side , craving aid for henry , he , on his right , asking a wife for edward .
she weeps , and says her henry is deposed , he smiles , and says his edward is install , that she , poor wretch , for grief can speak no more , whiles warwick tells his title , smooths the wrong , inferreth arguments of mighty strength , and in conclusion wins the king from her , with promise of his sister , and what else , to strengthen and support king edward place .
o margaret , thus be , and thou , poor soul , art then forsaken , as thou forlorn !
say , what art thou that of kings and queens ?
more than i seem , and less than i was born to a man at least , for less i should not be , and men may talk of kings , and why not i ?
ay , but thou as if thou wert a king .
why , so i am , in mind , and that enough .
but , if thou be a king , where is thy crown ?
my crown is in my heart , not on my head , not decked with diamonds and indian stones , nor to be seen my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy .
well , if you be a king crown with content , your crown content and you must be contented to go along with us , for as we think , you are the king king edward hath deposed , and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance will apprehend you as his enemy .
but did you never swear , and break an oath ?
no , never such an oath , nor will not now .
where did you dwell when i was king of england ?
here in this country , where we now remain .
i was anointed king at nine months old , my father and my grandfather were kings , and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me , then , have you not broke your oaths ?
no , for we were subjects but while you were king .
why , am i dead ?
do i not breathe a man ?
ah , simple men , you know not what you swear !
look , as i blow this feather from my face , and as the air blows it to me again , obeying with my wind when i do blow , and yielding to another when it blows , commanded always by the greater gust , such is the lightness of you common men .
but do not break your oaths , for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty .
go where you will , the king shall be commanded , and be you kings , command , and i obey .
we are true subjects to the king , king edward .
so would you be again to henry , if he were seated as king edward is .
we charge you , in god name , and the king , to go with us unto the officers .
in god name , lead , your king name be obey and what god will , that let your king perform , and what he will , i humbly yield unto .
exeunt scene ii .
london .
the palace .
enter king edward iv , gloucester , clarence , and lady grey brother of gloucester , at saint alban field this lady husband , sir richard grey , was slain , his lands then seized on by the conqueror her suit is now to repossess those lands , which we in justice can not well deny , because in quarrel of the house of york the worthy gentleman did lose his life .
your highness shall do well to grant her suit , it were dishonour to deny it her .
it were no less , but yet i make a pause .
aside to clarence yea , is it so ?
i see the lady hath a thing to grant , before the king will grant her humble suit .
aside to gloucester he knows the game how true he keeps the wind !
aside to clarence silence !
widow , we will consider of your suit , and come some other time to know our mind .
right gracious lord , i can not brook delay may it please your highness to resolve me now , and what your pleasure is , shall satisfy me .
aside to clarence ay , widow ?
then i warrant you all your lands , an if what pleases him shall pleasure you .
fight closer , or , good faith , you catch a blow .
aside to gloucester i fear her not , unless she chance to fall .
aside to clarence god forbid that !
for he take vantages .
how many children hast thou , widow ?
tell me .
aside to gloucester i think he means to beg a child of her .
aside to clarence nay , whip me then he rather give her two .
three , my most gracious lord .
aside to clarence you shall have four , if you be ruled by him .
pity they should lose their father lands .
be pitiful , dread lord , and grant it then .
lords , give us leave i try this widow wit .
aside to clarence ay , good leave have you , for you will have leave , till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch .
gloucester and clarence retire now tell me , madam , do you love your children ?
ay , full as dearly as i love myself .
and would you not do much to do them good ?
to do them good , i would sustain some harm .
then get your husband lands , to do them good .
therefore i came unto your majesty .
i tell you how these lands are to be got .
so shall you bind me to your highness ' service .
what service wilt thou do me , if i give them ?
what you command , that rests in me to do .
but you will take exceptions to my boon .
no , gracious lord , except i can not do it .
ay , but thou canst do what i mean to ask .
why , then i will do what your grace commands .
aside to clarence he plies her hard , and much rain wears the marble .
aside to gloucester as red as fire !
nay , then her wax must melt .
why stops my lord , shall i not hear my task ?
an easy task , is but to love a king .
that soon perform , because i am a subject .
why , then , thy husband lands i freely give thee .
i take my leave with many thousand thanks .
aside to clarence the match is made , she seals it with a curtsy .
but stay thee , is the fruits of love i mean .
the fruits of love i mean , my loving liege .
ay , but , i fear me , in another sense .
what love , thou , i sue so much to get ?
my love till death , my humble thanks , my prayers , that love which virtue begs and virtue grants .
no , by my troth , i did not mean such love .
why , then you mean not as i thought you did .
but now you partly may perceive my mind .
my mind will never grant what i perceive your highness aims at , if i aim aright .
to tell thee plain , i aim to lie with thee .
to tell you plain , i had rather lie in prison .
why , then thou shalt not have thy husband lands .
why , then mine honesty shall be my dower , for by that loss i will not purchase them .
therein thou thy children mightily .
herein your highness wrongs both them and me .
but , mighty lord , this merry inclination accords not with the sadness of my suit please you dismiss me either with ' or . '
ay , if thou wilt say ' to my request , no if thou dost say ' to my demand .
then , no , my lord .
my suit is at an end .
aside to clarence the widow likes him not , she knits her brows .
aside to gloucester he is the bluntest wooer in christendom .
aside her looks do argue her replete with modesty , her words do show her wit incomparable , all her perfections challenge sovereignty one way or other , she is for a king , and she shall be my love , or else my say that king edward take thee for his queen ?
is better said than done , my gracious lord i am a subject fit to jest withal , but far unfit to be a sovereign .
sweet widow , by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends , and that is , to enjoy thee for my love .
and that is more than i will yield unto i know i am too mean to be your queen , and yet too good to be your concubine .
you cavil , widow i did mean , my queen .
grieve your grace my sons should call you father .
no more than when my daughters call thee mother .
thou art a widow , and thou hast some children , and , by god mother , i , being but a bachelor , have other some why , is a happy thing to be the father unto many sons .
answer no more , for thou shalt be my queen .
aside to clarence the ghostly father now hath done his shrift .
aside to gloucester when he was made a shriver , was for shift .
brothers , you muse what chat we two have had .
the widow likes it not , for she looks very sad .
you think it strange if i should marry her .
to whom , my lord ?
why , clarence , to myself .
that would be ten days ' wonder at the least .
that a day longer than a wonder lasts .
by so much is the wonder in extremes .
well , jest on , brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband lands .
enter a nobleman my gracious lord , henry your foe is taken , and brought your prisoner to your palace gate .
see that he be convey unto the tower and go we , brothers , to the man that took him , to question of his apprehension .
widow , go you along .
lords , use her honourably .
exeunt all but gloucester ay , edward will use women honourably .
would he were wasted , marrow , bones and all , that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring , to cross me from the golden time i look for !
and yet , between my soul desire and me the lustful edward title buried is clarence , henry , and his son young edward , and all the unlook for issue of their bodies , to take their rooms , ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose !
why , then , i do but dream on sovereignty , like one that stands upon a promontory , and spies a shore where he would tread , wishing his foot were equal with his eye , and chides the sea that sunders him from thence , saying , he lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown , being so far off , and so i chide the means that keeps me from it , and so i say , i cut the causes off , flattering me with impossibilities .
my eye too quick , my heart too much , unless my hand and strength could equal them .
well , say there is no kingdom then for richard , what other pleasure can the world afford ?
i make my heaven in a lady lap , and deck my body in gay ornaments , and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks .
o miserable thought !
and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns !
why , love forswore me in my mother womb and , for i should not deal in her soft laws , she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe , to shrink mine arm up like a wither shrub , to make an envious mountain on my back , where sits deformity to mock my body , to shape my legs of an unequal size , to disproportion me in every part , like to a chaos , or an unlick that carries no impression like the dam .
and am i then a man to be beloved ?
o monstrous fault , to harbour such a thought !
then , since this earth affords no joy to me , but to command , to cheque , to such as are of better person than myself , i make my heaven to dream upon the crown , and , whiles i live , to account this world but hell , until my trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown .
and yet i know not how to get the crown , for many lives stand between me and home and i , like one lost in a thorny wood , that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns , seeking a way and straying from the way , not knowing how to find the open air , but toiling desperately to find it out , torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself , or hew my way out with a bloody axe .
why , i can smile , and murder whiles i smile , and cry ' to that which grieves my heart , and wet my cheeks with artificial tears , and frame my face to all occasions .
i drown more sailors than the mermaid shall , i slay more gazers than the basilisk , i play the orator as well as nestor , deceive more slily than ulysses could , and , like a sinon , take another troy .
i can add colours to the chameleon , change shapes with proteus for advantages , and set the murderous machiavel to school .
can i do this , and can not get a crown ?
tut , were it farther off , i pluck it down .
exit scene iii .
france .
king lewis xi palace .
flourish .
enter king lewis xi , his sister bona , his admiral , called bourbon , prince edward , queen margaret , and oxford .
king lewis xi sits , and riseth up again fair queen of england , worthy margaret , sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth , that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit .
no , mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command .
i was , i must confess , great albion queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down , and with dishonour laid me on the ground , where i must take like seat unto my fortune , and to my humble seat conform myself .
why , say , fair queen , whence springs this deep despair ?
from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue , while heart is drown in cares .
it be , be thou still like thyself , and sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck to fortune yoke , but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance .
be plain , queen margaret , and tell thy grief , it shall be eased , if france can yield relief .
those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my sorrows leave to speak .
now , therefore , be it known to noble lewis , that henry , sole possessor of my love , is of a king become a banish man , and forced to live in scotland a forlorn , while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england lawful king .
this is the cause that i , poor margaret , with this my son , prince edward , henry heir , am come to crave thy just and lawful aid , and if thou fail us , all our hope is done scotland hath will to help , but can not help , our people and our peers are both misled , our treasures seized , our soldiers put to flight , and , as thou seest , ourselves in heavy plight .
renowned queen , with patience calm the storm , while we bethink a means to break it off .
the more we stay , the stronger grows our foe .
the more i stay , the more i succor thee .
o , but impatience waiteth on true sorrow .
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow !
enter warwick what he approacheth boldly to our presence ?
our earl of warwick , edward greatest friend .
welcome , brave warwick !
what brings thee to france ?
he descends .
she ariseth ay , now begins a second storm to rise , for this is he that moves both wind and tide .
from worthy edward , king of albion , my lord and sovereign , and thy vowed friend , i come , in kindness and unfeigned love , first , to do greetings to thy royal person , and then to crave a league of amity , and lastly , to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot , if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona , thy fair sister , to england king in lawful marriage .
aside if that go forward , henry hope is done .
to bona and , gracious madam , in our king behalf , i am commanded , with your leave and favour , humbly to kiss your hand , and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign heart , where fame , late entering at his heedful ears , hath placed thy beauty image and thy virtue .
king lewis and lady bona , hear me speak , before you answer warwick .
his demand springs not from edward honest love , but from deceit bred by necessity , for how can tyrants safely govern home , unless abroad they purchase great alliance ?
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice , that henry liveth still but were he dead , yet here prince edward stands , king henry son .
look , therefore , lewis , that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour , for though usurpers sway the rule awhile , yet heavens are just , and time suppresseth wrongs .
injurious margaret !
and why not queen ?
because thy father henry did usurp , and thou no more are prince than she is queen .
then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt , which did subdue the greatest part of spain , and , after john of gaunt , henry the fourth , whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest , and , after that wise prince , henry the fifth , who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends .
oxford , how haps it , in this smooth discourse , you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten ?
methinks these peers of france should smile at that .
but for the rest , you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years , a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom worth .
why , warwick , canst thou speak against thy liege , whom thou thirty and six years , and not bewray thy treason with a blush ?
can oxford , that did ever fence the right , now buckler falsehood with a pedigree ?
for shame !
leave henry , and call edward king .
call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother , the lord aubrey vere , was done to death ?
and more than so , my father , even in the downfall of his mellow years , when nature brought him to the door of death ?
no , warwick , no , while life upholds this arm , this arm upholds the house of lancaster .
and i the house of york .
queen margaret , prince edward , and oxford , vouchsafe , at our request , to stand aside , while i use further conference with warwick .
they stand aloof heavens grant that warwick words bewitch him not !
now warwick , tell me , even upon thy conscience , is edward your true king ?
for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen .
thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour .
but is he gracious in the people eye ?
the more that henry was unfortunate .
then further , all dissembling set aside , tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona .
such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself .
myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant , whereof the root was fix in virtue ground , the leaves and fruit maintain with beauty sun , exempt from envy , but not from disdain , unless the lady bona quit his pain .
now , sister , let us hear your firm resolve .
your grant , or your denial , shall be mine to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day , when i have heard your king desert recounted , mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire .
then , warwick , thus our sister shall be edward , and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make , which with her dowry shall be counterpoised .
draw near , queen margaret , and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king .
to edward , but not to the english king .
deceitful warwick !
it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry friend .
and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak , as may appear by edward good success , then is but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised .
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield .
henry now lives in scotland at his ease , where having nothing , nothing can he lose .
and as for you yourself , our quondam queen , you have a father able to maintain you , and better you troubled him than france .
peace , impudent and shameless warwick , peace , proud setter up and puller down of kings !
i will not hence , till , with my talk and tears , both full of truth , i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord false love , for both of you are birds of selfsame feather .
post blows a horn within warwick , this is some post to us or thee .
enter a post to warwick my lord ambassador , these letters are for you , sent from your brother , marquess montague to king lewis xi these from our king unto your majesty to queen margaret and , madam , these for you , from whom i know not .
they all read their letters i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news , while warwick frowns at his .
nay , mark how lewis stamps , as he were nettled i hope all for the best .
warwick , what are thy news ?
and yours , fair queen ?
mine , such as fill my heart with unhoped joys .
mine , full of sorrow and heart discontent .
what !
has your king married the lady grey !
and now , to soothe your forgery and his , sends me a paper to persuade me patience ?
is this the alliance that he seeks with france ?
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner ?
i told your majesty as much before this proveth edward love and warwick honesty .
king lewis , i here protest , in sight of heaven , and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss , that i am clear from this misdeed of edward , no more my king , for he dishonours me , but most himself , if he could see his shame .
did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death ?
did i let pass the abuse done to my niece ?
did i impale him with the regal crown ?
did i put henry from his native right ?
and am i guerdon at the last with shame ?
shame on himself !
for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him , i here renounce him and return to henry .
my noble queen , let former grudges pass , and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona , and replant henry in his former state .
warwick , these words have turn my hate to love , and i forgive and quite forget old faults , and joy that thou becomest king henry friend .
so much his friend , ay , his unfeigned friend , that , if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers , i undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war .
is not his bride shall succor him and as for clarence , as my letters tell me , he very likely now to fall from him , for matching more for wanton lust than honour , or than for strength and safety of our country .
dear brother , how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen ?
renowned prince , how shall poor henry live , unless thou rescue him from foul despair ?
my quarrel and this english queen are one .
and mine , fair lady bona , joins with yours .
and mine with hers , and thine , and margaret .
therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid .
let me give humble thanks for all at once .
then , england messenger , return in post , and tell false edward , thy supposed king , that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest what past , go fear thy king withal .
tell him , in hope he prove a widower shortly , i wear the willow garland for his sake .
tell him , my mourning weeds are laid aside , and i am ready to put armour on .
tell him from me that he hath done me wrong , and therefore i uncrown him be long .
there thy reward be gone .
exit post but , warwick , thou and oxford , with five thousand men , shall cross the seas , and bid false edward battle , and , as occasion serves , this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply .
yet , ere thou go , but answer me one doubt , what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty ?
this shall assure my constant loyalty , that if our queen and this young prince agree , i join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands .
yes , i agree , and thank you for your motion .
son edward , she is fair and virtuous , therefore delay not , give thy hand to warwick , and , with thy hand , thy faith irrevocable , that only warwick daughter shall be thine .
yes , i accept her , for she well deserves it , and here , to pledge my vow , i give my hand .
he gives his hand to warwick why stay we now ?
these soldiers shall be levied , and thou , lord bourbon , our high admiral , shalt waft them over with our royal fleet .
i long till edward fall by war mischance , for mocking marriage with a dame of france .
exeunt all but warwick i came from edward as ambassador , but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me , but dreadful war shall answer his demand .
had he none else to make a stale but me ?
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow .
i was the chief that raised him to the crown , and i be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry misery , but seek revenge on edward mockery .
exit act iv scene london .
the palace .
enter gloucester , clarence , somerset , and montague now tell me , brother clarence , what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey ?
hath not our brother made a worthy choice ?
alas , you know , is far from hence to france , how could he stay till warwick made return ?
my lords , forbear this talk , here comes the king .
and his bride .
i mind to tell him plainly what i think .
flourish .
enter king edward iv , attended , queen elizabeth , pembroke , stafford , hastings , and others now , brother of clarence , how like you our choice , that you stand pensive , as half malcontent ?
as well as lewis of france , or the earl of warwick , which are so weak of courage and in judgment that they take no offence at our abuse .
suppose they take offence without a cause , they are but lewis and warwick i am edward , your king and warwick , and must have my will .
and shall have your will , because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well .
yea , brother richard , are you offended too ?
not i no , god forbid that i should wish them sever whom god hath join together , ay , and pity to sunder them that yoke so well together .
setting your scorns and your mislike aside , tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england queen .
and you too , somerset and montague , speak freely what you think .
then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy , for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona .
and warwick , doing what you gave in charge , is now dishonoured by this new marriage .
what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise ?
yet , to have join with france in such alliance would more have strengthen this our commonwealth foreign storms than any marriage .
why , knows not montague that of itself england is safe , if true within itself ?
but the safer when is back with france .
is better using france than trusting france let us be back with god and with the seas which he hath given for fence impregnable , and with their helps only defend ourselves , in them and in ourselves our safety lies .
for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford .
ay , what of that ?
it was my will and grant , and for this once my will shall stand for law .
and yet methinks your grace hath not done well , to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride , she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood .
or else you would not have bestow the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife son , and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere .
alas , poor clarence !
is it for a wife that thou art malcontent ?
i will provide thee .
in choosing for yourself , you show your judgment , which being shallow , you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf , and to that end i shortly mind to leave you .
leave me , or tarry , edward will be king , and not be tied unto his brother will .
my lords , before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen , do me but right , and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent , and meaner than myself have had like fortune .
but as this title honours me and mine , so your dislike , to whom i would be pleasing , doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow .
my love , forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee , so long as edward is thy constant friend , and their true sovereign , whom they must obey ?
nay , whom they shall obey , and love thee too , unless they seek for hatred at my hands , which if they do , yet will i keep thee safe , and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath .
aside i hear , yet say not much , but think the more .
enter a post now , messenger , what letters or what news from france ?
my sovereign liege , no letters , and few words , but such as i , without your special pardon , dare not relate .
go to , we pardon thee therefore , in brief , tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them .
what answer makes king lewis unto our letters ?
at my depart , these were his very words tell false edward , thy supposed king , that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride . '
is lewis so brave ?
belike he thinks me henry .
but what said lady bona to my marriage ?
these were her words , utter with mad disdain him , in hope he prove a widower shortly , i wear the willow garland for his sake . '
i blame not her , she could say little less , she had the wrong .
but what said henry queen ?
for i have heard that she was there in place .
him , ' quoth she , mourning weeds are done , and i am ready to put armour on . '
belike she minds to play the amazon .
but what said warwick to these injuries ?
he , more incensed against your majesty than all the rest , discharged me with these words him from me that he hath done me wrong , and therefore i uncrown him be long . '
ha !
durst the traitor breathe out so proud words ?
well i will arm me , being thus forewarn they shall have wars and pay for their presumption .
but say , is warwick friends with margaret ?
ay , gracious sovereign , they are so link in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick daughter .
belike the elder , clarence will have the younger .
now , brother king , farewell , and sit you fast , for i will hence to warwick other daughter , that , though i want a kingdom , yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself .
you that love me and warwick , follow me .
exit clarence , and somerset follows aside not i my thoughts aim at a further matter , i stay not for the love of edward , but the crown .
clarence and somerset both gone to warwick !
yet am i arm against the worst can happen , and haste is needful in this desperate case .
pembroke and stafford , you in our behalf go levy men , and make prepare for war , they are already , or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you .
exeunt pembroke and stafford but , ere i go , hastings and montague , resolve my doubt .
you twain , of all the rest , are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me ?
if it be so , then both depart to him , i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience , give me assurance with some friendly vow , that i may never have you in suspect .
so god help montague as he proves true !
and hastings as he favours edward cause !
now , brother richard , will you stand by us ?
ay , in despite of all that shall withstand you .
why , so !
then am i sure of victory .
now therefore let us hence , and lose no hour , till we meet warwick with his foreign power .
exeunt scene ii .
a plain in warwickshire .
enter warwick and oxford , with french soldiers trust me , my lord , all hitherto goes well , the common people by numbers swarm to us .
enter clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence come !
speak suddenly , my lords , are we all friends ?
fear not that , my lord .
then , gentle clarence , welcome unto warwick , and welcome , somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawn an open hand in sign of love , else might i think that clarence , edward brother , were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome , sweet clarence , my daughter shall be thine .
and now what rests but , in night coverture , thy brother being carelessly encamp , his soldiers lurking in the towns about , and but attended by a simple guard , we may surprise and take him at our pleasure ?
our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus ' tents , and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds , so we , well cover with the night black mantle , at unawares may beat down edward guard and seize himself , i say not , slaughter him , for i intend but only to surprise him .
you that will follow me to this attempt , applaud the name of henry with your leader .
they all cry , ! '
why , then , let on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends , god and saint george !
exeunt scene iii .
edward camp , near warwick .
enter three watchmen , to guard king edward iv tent come on , my masters , each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep .
what , will he not to bed ?
why , no , for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppress .
then belike shall be the day , if warwick be so near as men report .
but say , i pray , what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent ?
is the lord hastings , the king chiefest friend .
o , is it so ?
but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him , while he himself keeps in the cold field ?
is the more honour , because more dangerous .
ay , but give me worship and quietness , i like it better than a dangerous honour .
if warwick knew in what estate he stands , is to be doubted he would waken him .
unless our halberds did shut up his passage .
ay , wherefore else guard we his royal tent , but to defend his person from ?
enter warwick , clarence , oxford , somerset , and french soldiers , silent all this is his tent , and see where stand his guard .
courage , my masters !
honour now or never !
but follow me , and edward shall be ours .
who goes there ?
stay , or thou diest !
warwick and the rest cry all , !
warwick ! '
and set upon the guard , who fly , crying , !
arm ! '
warwick and the rest following them the drum playing and trumpet sounding , reenter warwick , somerset , and the rest , bringing king edward iv out in his gown , sitting in a chair .
richard and hastings fly over the stage what are they that fly there ?
richard and hastings let them go , here is the duke .
the duke !
why , warwick , when we parted , thou me king .
ay , but the case is alter when you disgraced me in my embassade , then i degraded you from being king , and come now to create you duke of york .
alas !
how should you govern any kingdom , that know not how to use ambassadors , nor how to be contented with one wife , nor how to use your brothers brotherly , nor how to study for the people welfare , nor how to shroud yourself from enemies ?
yea , brother of clarence , are thou here too ?
nay , then i see that edward needs must down .
yet , warwick , in despite of all mischance , of thee thyself and all thy complices , edward will always bear himself as king though fortune malice overthrow my state , my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel .
then , for his mind , be edward england king takes off his crown but henry now shall wear the english crown , and be true king indeed , thou but the shadow .
my lord of somerset , at my request , see that forthwith duke edward be convey unto my brother , archbishop of york .
when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows , i follow you , and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him .

enter queen elizabeth and rivers madam , what makes you in this sudden change ?
why brother rivers , are you yet to learn what late misfortune is king edward ?
what !
loss of some pitch battle against warwick ?
no , but the loss of his own royal person .
then is my sovereign slain ?
ay , almost slain , for he is taken prisoner , either betray by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surprised at unawares and , as i further have to understand , is new committed to the bishop of york , fell warwick brother and by that our foe .
these news i must confess are full of grief , yet , gracious madam , bear it as you may warwick may lose , that now hath won the day .
till then fair hope must hinder life decay .
and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edward offspring in my womb this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortune cross , ay , ay , for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of sighs , lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edward fruit , true heir to the english crown .
but , madam , where is warwick then become ?
i am inform that he comes towards london , to set the crown once more on henry head guess thou the rest , king edward friends must down , but , to prevent the tyrant violence , for trust not him that hath once broken faith , i hence forthwith unto the sanctuary , to save at least the heir of edward right there shall i rest secure from force and fraud .
come , therefore , let us fly while we may fly if warwick take us we are sure to die .
exeunt scene a park near middleham castle in yorkshire .
enter gloucester , hastings , and stanley now , my lord hastings and sir william stanley , leave off to wonder why i drew you hither , into this chiefest thicket of the park .
thus stands the case you know our king , my brother , is prisoner to the bishop here , at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty , and , often but attended with weak guard , comes hunting this way to disport himself .
i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game , he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity .
enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him this way , my lord , for this way lies the game .
nay , this way , man see where the huntsmen stand .
now , brother of gloucester , lord hastings , and the rest , stand you thus close , to steal the bishop deer ?
brother , the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the .
but whither shall we then ?
to lynn , my lord , and ship from thence to flanders .
well guess , believe me , for that was my meaning .
stanley , i will requite thy forwardness .
but wherefore stay we ?
is no time to talk .
huntsman , what thou ?
wilt thou go along ?
better do so than tarry and be hang .

subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns , but if an humble prayer may prevail , i then crave pardon of your majesty .
for what , lieutenant ?
for well using me ?
nay , be thou sure i well requite thy kindness , for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure , ay , such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty .
but , warwick , after god , thou me free , and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee , he was the author , thou the instrument .
therefore , that i may conquer fortune spite by living low , where fortune can not hurt me , and that the people of this blessed land may not be punish with my thwarting stars , warwick , although my head still wear the crown , i here resign my government to thee , for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds .
your grace hath still been famed for virtuous , and now may seem as wise as virtuous , by spying and avoiding fortune malice , for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace , for choosing me when clarence is in place .
no , warwick , thou art worthy of the sway , to whom the heavens in thy nativity adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown , as likely to be blest in peace and war , and therefore i yield thee my free consent .
and i choose clarence only for protector .
warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands , and with your hands your hearts , that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land , while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days , to sin rebuke and my creator praise .
what answers clarence to his sovereign will ?
that he consents , if warwick yield consent , for on thy fortune i repose myself .
why , then , though loath , yet must i be content we yoke together , like a double shadow to henry body , and supply his place , i mean , in bearing weight of government , while he enjoys the honour and his ease .
and , clarence , now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor , and all his lands and goods be confiscate .
what else ?
and that succession be determined .
ay , therein clarence shall not want his part .
but , with the first of all your chief affairs , let me entreat , for i command no more , that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for , to return from france with speed , for , till i see them here , by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed .
it shall be done , my sovereign , with all speed .
my lord of somerset , what youth is that , of whom you seem to have so tender care ?
my liege , it is young henry , earl of richmond .
come hither , england hope .
lays his hand on his head if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts , this pretty lad will prove our country bliss .
his looks are full of peaceful majesty , his head by nature framed to wear a crown , his hand to wield a sceptre , and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne .
make much of him , my lords , for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me .
enter a post what news , my friend ?
that edward is escaped from your brother , and fled , as he hears since , to burgundy .
unsavoury news !
but how made he escape ?
he was convey by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings , who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishop huntsmen rescued him , for hunting was his daily exercise .
my brother was too careless of his charge .
but let us hence , my sovereign , to provide a salve for any sore that may betide .
exeunt all but somerset , henry of richmond , and oxford my lord , i like not of this flight of edward , for doubtless burgundy will yield him help , and we shall have more wars before be long .
as henry late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond , so doth my heart misgive me , in these conflicts what may befall him , to his harm and ours therefore , lord oxford , to prevent the worst , forthwith we send him hence to brittany , till storms be past of civil enmity .
ay , for if edward repossess the crown , is like that richmond with the rest shall down .
it shall be so , he shall to brittany .
come , therefore , let about it speedily .

well have we pass and now repass the seas and brought desired help from burgundy what then remains , we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york , but that we enter , as into our dukedom ?
the gates made fast !
brother , i like not this , for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within .
tush , man , abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in , for hither will our friends repair to us .
my liege , i knock once more to summon them .
enter , on the walls , the mayor of york , and his brethren my lords , we were forewarned of your coming , and shut the gates for safety of ourselves , for now we owe allegiance unto henry .
but , master mayor , if henry be your king , yet edward at the least is duke of york .
true , my good lord , i know you for no less .
why , and i challenge nothing but my dukedom , as being well content with that alone .
aside but when the fox hath once got in his nose , he soon find means to make the body follow .
why , master mayor , why stand you in a doubt ?
open the gates , we are king henry friends .
ay , say you so ?
the gates shall then be open .
they descend a wise stout captain , and soon persuaded !
the good old man would fain that all were well , so not of him , but being enter , i doubt not , i , but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason .

welcome , sir john !
but why come you in arms ?
to help king edward in his time of storm , as every loyal subject ought to do .
thanks , good montgomery , but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest .
then fare you well , for i will hence again i came to serve a king and not a duke .
drummer , strike up , and let us march away .
the drum begins to march nay , stay , sir john , awhi le , and we debate by what safe means the crown may be recover .
what talk you of debating ?
in few words , if you not here proclaim yourself our king , i leave you to your fortune and be gone to keep them back that come to succor you why shall we fight , if you pretend no title ?
why , brother , wherefore stand you on nice points ?
when we grow stronger , then we make our claim till then , is wisdom to conceal our meaning .
away with scrupulous wit !
now arms must rule .
and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns .
brother , we will proclaim you out of hand the bruit thereof will bring you many friends .
then be it as you will , for is my right , and henry but usurps the diadem .
ay , now my sovereign speaketh like himself , and now will i be edward champion .

now , for this night , let harbour here in york , and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon , we forward towards warwick and his mates , for well i wot that henry is no soldier .
ah , froward clarence !

let levy men , and beat him back again .
a little fire is quickly trodden out , which , being suffer , rivers can not quench .
in warwickshire i have friends , not mutinous in peace , yet bold in war , those will i muster up and thou , son clarence , shalt stir up in suffolk , norfolk , and in kent , the knights and gentlemen to come with thee thou , brother montague , in buckingham , northampton and in leicestershire , shalt find men well inclined to hear what thou and thou , brave oxford , wondrous well beloved , in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends .
my sovereign , with the loving citizens , like to his island girt in with the ocean , or modest dian circled with her nymphs , shall rest in london till we come to him .
fair lords , take leave and stand not to reply .
farewell , my sovereign .
farewell , my hector , and my troy true hope .
in sign of truth , i kiss your highness ' hand .

farewell , sweet lords let meet at coventry .
exeunt all but king henry vi and exeter here at the palace i will rest awhile .
cousin of exeter , what thinks your lordship ?
methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine .
the doubt is that he will seduce the rest .
that not my fear , my meed hath got me fame i have not stopp mine ears to their demands , nor posted off their suits with slow delays , my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds , my mildness hath allay their swelling griefs , my mercy dried their tears , i have not been desirous of their wealth , nor much oppress them with great subsidies .
nor forward of revenge , though they much err then why should they love edward more than me ?
no , exeter , these graces challenge grace and when the lion fawns upon the lamb , the lamb will never cease to follow him .

see how the surly warwick mans the wall !
o unbid spite !
is sportful edward come ?
where slept our scouts , or how are they seduced , that we could hear no news of his repair ?
now , warwick , wilt thou ope the city gates , speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee , call edward king and at his hands beg mercy ?
and he shall pardon thee these outrages .
nay , rather , wilt thou draw thy forces hence , confess who set thee up and pluck thee own , call warwick patron and be penitent ?
and thou shalt still remain the duke of york .
i thought , at least , he would have said the king , or did he make the jest against his will ?
is not a dukedom , sir , a goodly gift ?
ay , by my faith , for a poor earl to give i do thee service for so good a gift .
was i that gave the kingdom to thy brother .
why then is mine , if but by warwick gift .
thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling , warwick takes his gift again , and henry is my king , warwick his subject .
but warwick king is edward prisoner and , gallant warwick , do but answer this what is the body when the head is off ?
alas , that warwick had no more forecast , but , whiles he thought to steal the single ten , the king was slily finger from the deck !
you left poor henry at the bishop palace , and , ten to one , you meet him in the tower .
is even so , yet you are warwick still .
come , warwick , take the time , kneel down , kneel down nay , when ?
strike now , or else the iron cools .
i had rather chop this hand off at a blow , and with the other fling it at thy face , than bear so low a sail , to strike to thee .
sail how thou canst , have wind and tide thy friend , this hand , fast wound about thy hair shall , whiles thy head is warm and new cut off , write in the dust this sentence with thy blood , warwick now can change no more . '

come , clarence , come , thou wilt , if warwick call .
father of warwick , know you what this means ?
taking his red rose out of his hat look here , i throw my infamy at thee i will not ruinate my father house , who gave his blood to lime the stones together , and set up lancaster .
why , thou , warwick , that clarence is so harsh , so blunt , unnatural , to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king ?
perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath to keep that oath were more impiety than jephthah , when he sacrificed his daughter .
i am so sorry for my trespass made that , to deserve well at my brother hands , i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe , with resolution , i meet thee as i will meet thee , if thou stir abroad to plague thee for thy foul misleading me .
and so , warwick , i defy thee , and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks .
pardon me , edward , i will make amends and , richard , do not frown upon my faults , for i will henceforth be no more unconstant .
now welcome more , and ten times more beloved , than if thou never hadst deserved our hate .
welcome , good clarence , this is brotherlike .
o passing traitor , perjured and unjust !
what , warwick , wilt thou leave the town and fight ?
or shall we beat the stones about thine ears ?
alas , i am not coop here for defence !

exit ah , who is nigh ?
come to me , friend or foe , and tell me who is victor , york or warwick ?
why ask i that ?
my mangled body shows , my blood , my want of strength , my sick heart shows .
that i must yield my body to the earth and , by my fall , the conquest to my foe .
thus yields the cedar to the axe edge , whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle , under whose shade the ramping lion slept , whose overpeer jove spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter powerful wind .
these eyes , that now are dimm with death black veil , have been as piercing as the sun , to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows , now filled with blood , were liken oft to kingly sepulchres , for who lived king , but i could dig his grave ?
and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow ?
lo , now my glory smear in dust and blood !
my parks , my walks , my manors that i had .
even now forsake me , and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body length .
why , what is pomp , rule , reign , but earth and dust ?

why , then i would not fly .
ah , montague , if thou be there , sweet brother , take my hand .
and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile !
thou lovest me not , for , brother , if thou didst , thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak .
come quickly , montague , or i am dead .
ah , warwick !
montague hath breathed his last , and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick , and said me to my valiant brother . '
and more he would have said , and more he spoke , which sounded like a clamour in a vault , that mought not be distinguished , but at last i well might hear , delivered with a groan , ' o , farewell , warwick ! '
sweet rest his soul !
fly , lords , and save yourselves , for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven .

a little gale will soon disperse that cloud and blow it to the source from whence it came the very beams will dry those vapours up , for every cloud engenders not a storm .

tread on the sand , why , there you quickly sink bestride the rock , the tide will wash you off , or else you famish , that a threefold death .
this speak i , lords , to let you understand , if case some one of you would fly from us , that there no mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves , with sands and rocks .
why , courage then !
what can not be avoided childish weakness to lament or fear .
methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should , if a coward heard her speak these words , infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him , naked , foil a man at arms .
i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes , lest in our need he might infect another and make him of like spirit to himself .
if any such be here as god forbid ! let him depart before we need his help .
women and children of so high a courage , and warriors faint !
why , perpetual shame .

thy famous grandfather doth live again in thee long mayst thou live to bear his image and renew his glories !

good clarence , do , sweet clarence , do thou do it .
didst thou not hear me swear i would not do it ?
ay , but thou usest to forswear thyself was sin before , but now is charity .

what scene of death hath roscius now to act ?
suspicion always haunts the guilty mind , the thief doth fear each bush an officer .
the bird that hath been limed in a bush , with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush , and i , the hapless male to one sweet bird , have now the fatal object in my eye where my poor young was limed , was caught and kill .
why , what a peevish fool was that of crete , that taught his son the office of a fowl !
an yet , for all his wings , the fool was drown .
i , daedalus , my poor boy , icarus , thy father , minos , that denied our course , the sun that sear the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward , and thyself the sea whose envious gulf did swallow up his life .
ah , kill me with thy weapon , not with words !
my breast can better brook thy dagger point than can my ears that tragic history .
but wherefore dost thou come ?
for my life ?
thou i am an executioner ?
a persecutor , i am sure , thou art if murdering innocents be executing , why , then thou art an executioner .
thy son i kill for his presumption .
hadst thou been kill when first thou didst presume , thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine .
and thus i prophesy , that many a thousand , which now mistrust no parcel of my fear , and many an old man sigh and many a widow , and many an orphan eye men for their sons , wives for their husbands , and orphans for their parents timeless death shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born .
the owl shriek at thy birth , an evil sign , the cried , aboding luckless time , dogs howl , and hideous tempest shook down trees , the raven rook her on the chimney top , and chattering pies in dismal discords sung .
thy mother felt more than a mother pain , and , yet brought forth less than a mother hope , to wit , an indigested and deformed lump , not like the fruit of such a goodly tree .
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born , to signify thou camest to bite the world and , if the rest be true which i have heard , thou camest i hear no more die , prophet in thy speech stabs him for this amongst the rest , was i ordain .
ay , and for much more slaughter after this .
god forgive my sins , and pardon thee !
dies what , will the aspiring blood of lancaster sink in the ground ?
i thought it would have mounted .
see how my sword weeps for the poor king death !
o , may such purple tears be alway shed from those that wish the downfall of our house !
if any spark of life be yet remaining , down , down to hell , and say i sent thee thither stabs him again i , that have neither pity , love , nor fear .
indeed , is true that henry told me of , for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward had i not reason , think ye , to make haste , and seek their ruin that usurp our right ?
the midwife wonder and the women cried ' o , jesus bless us , he is born with teeth ! '
and so i was , which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog .
then , since the heavens have shaped my body so , let hell make crook my mind to answer it .
i have no brother , i am like no brother , and this word , ' which graybeards call divine , be resident in men like one another and not in me i am myself alone .
clarence , beware , thou me from the light but i will sort a pitchy day for thee , for i will buz abroad such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life , and then , to purge his fear , i be thy death .
king henry and the prince his son are gone clarence , thy turn is next , and then the rest , counting myself but bad till i be best .
i throw thy body in another room and triumph , henry , in thy day of doom .

exeunt act i scene rousillon .
the count palace .
enter bertram , the countess of rousillon , helena , and lafeu , all in black in delivering my son from me , i bury a second husband .
and i in going , madam , weep my father death anew but i must attend his majesty command , to whom i am now in ward , evermore in subjection .
you shall find of the king a husband , madam , you , sir , a father he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you , whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance .
what hope is there of his majesty amendment ?
he hath abandoned his physicians , madam , under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope , and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time .
this young gentlewoman had a father , o , that ' !
how sad a passage is ! whose skill was almost as great as his honesty , had it stretched so far , would have made nature immortal , and death should have play for lack of work .
would , for the king sake , he were living !
i think it would be the death of the king disease .
how called you the man you speak of , madam ?
he was famous , sir , in his profession , and it was his great right to be so gerard de narbon .
he was excellent indeed , madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have lived still , if knowledge could be set up against mortality .
what is it , my good lord , the king languishes of ?
a fistula , my lord .
i heard not of it before .
i would it were not notorious .
was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon ?
his sole child , my lord , and bequeathed to my overlooking .
i have those hopes of her good that her education promises , her dispositions she inherits , which makes fair gifts fairer , for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities , there commendations go with pity , they are virtues and traitors too , in her they are the better for their simpleness , she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness .
your commendations , madam , get from her tears .
is the best brine a maiden can season her praise in .
the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek .
no more of this , helena , go to , no more , lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it .
i do affect a sorrow indeed , but i have it too .
moderate lamentation is the right of the dead , excessive grief the enemy to the living .
if the living be enemy to the grief , the excess makes it soon mortal .
madam , i desire your holy wishes .
how understand we that ?
be thou blest , bertram , and succeed thy father in manners , as in shape !
thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee , and thy goodness share with thy birthright !
love all , trust a few , do wrong to none be able for thine enemy rather in power than use , and keep thy friend under thy own life key be cheque for silence , but never tax for speech .
what heaven more will , that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down , fall on thy head !
farewell , my lord , is an unseason courtier , good my lord , advise him .
he can not want the best that shall attend his love .
heaven bless him !
farewell , bertram .
exit to helena the best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you !
be comfortable to my mother , your mistress , and make much of her .
farewell , pretty lady you must hold the credit of your father .
exeunt bertram and lafeu o , were that all !
i think not on my father , and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him .
what was he like ?
i have forgot him my imagination carries no favour i but bertram .
i am undone there is no living , none , if bertram be away .
all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it , he is so above me in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted , not in his sphere .
the ambition in my love thus plagues itself the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love .
was pretty , though plague , to see him every hour , to sit and draw his arched brows , his hawking eye , his curls , in our heart table , heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour but now he gone , and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques .
who comes here ?
enter parolles aside one that goes with him i love him for his sake , and yet i know him a notorious liar , think him a great way fool , solely a coward , yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him , that they take place , when virtue steely bones look bleak i ' the cold wind withal , full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly .
save you , fair queen !
and you , monarch !
no .
and no .
are you meditating on virginity ?
ay .
you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question .
man is enemy to virginity , how may we barricado it against him ?
keep him out .
but he assails , and our virginity , though valiant , in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some warlike resistance .
there is none man , sitting down before you , will undermine you and blow you up .
bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up !
is there no military policy , how virgins might blow up men ?
virginity being blown down , man will quicklier be blown up marry , in blowing him down again , with the breach yourselves made , you lose your city .
it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity .
loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost .
that you were made of is metal to make virgins .
virginity by being once lost may be ten times found , by being ever kept , it is ever lost is too cold a companion , away with !
i will stand for a little , though therefore i die a virgin .
there little can be said in , is against the rule of nature .
to speak on the part of virginity , is to accuse your mothers , which is most infallible disobedience .
he that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit , as a desperate offendress against nature .
virginity breeds mites , much like a cheese , consumes itself to the very paring , and so dies with feeding his own stomach .
besides , virginity is peevish , proud , idle , made of , which is the most inhibited sin in the canon .
keep it not , you can not choose but loose out with !
within ten year it will make itself ten , which is a goodly increase , and the principal itself not much the worse away with !
how might one do , sir , to lose it to her own liking ?
let me see marry , ill , to like him that it likes .
is a commodity will lose the gloss with lying , the longer kept , the less worth off with while is vendible , answer the time of request .
virginity , like an old courtier , wears her cap out of fashion richly suited , but unsuitable just like the brooch and the , which wear not now .
your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek , and your virginity , your old virginity , is like one of our french withered pears , it looks ill , it eats drily , marry , is a withered pear , it was formerly better , marry , yet is a withered pear will you anything with it ?
not my virginity yet there shall your master have a thousand loves , a mother and a mistress and a friend , a phoenix , captain and an enemy , a guide , a goddess , and a sovereign , a counsellor , a traitress , and a dear , his humble ambition , proud humility , his jarring concord , and his discord dulcet , his faith , his sweet disaster , with a world of pretty , fond , adoptious christendoms , that blinking cupid gossips .
now shall he i know not what he shall .
god send him well !
the court a learning place , and he is one what one , i ' faith ?
that i wish well .
is pity what pity ?
that wishing well had not a body i , which might be felt , that we , the poorer born , whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes , might with effects of them follow our friends , and show what we alone must think , which never return us thanks .
enter page monsieur parolles , my lord calls for you .
exit little helen , farewell , if i can remember thee , i will think of thee at court .
monsieur parolles , you were born under a charitable star .
under mars , i .
i especially think , under mars .
why under mars ?
the wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars .
when he was predominant .
when he was retrograde , i think , rather .
why think you so ?
you go so much backward when you fight .
that for advantage .
so is running away , when fear proposes the safety , but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing , and i like the wear well .
i am so full of businesses , i can not answer thee acutely .
i will return perfect courtier , in the which , my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee , so thou wilt be capable of a courtier counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee , else thou diest in thine unthankfulness , and thine ignorance makes thee away farewell .
when thou hast leisure , say thy prayers , when thou hast none , remember thy friends , get thee a good husband , and use him as he uses thee , so , farewell .
exit our remedies oft in ourselves do lie , which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky gives us free scope , only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull .
what power is it which mounts my love so high , that makes me see , and can not feed mine eye ?
the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things .
impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been can not be who ever strove so show her merit , that did miss her love ?
the king disease my project may deceive me , but my intents are fix and will not leave me .

so is reported , sir .
nay , is most credible , we here received it a certainty , vouch from our cousin austria , with caution that the florentine will move us for speedy aid , wherein our dearest friend prejudicates the business and would seem to have us make denial .
his love and wisdom , approved so to your majesty , may plead for amplest credence .
he hath arm our answer , and florence is denied before he comes yet , for our gentlemen that mean to see the tuscan service , freely have they leave to stand on either part .
it well may serve a nursery to our gentry , who are sick for breathing and exploit .
what he comes here ?
enter bertram , lafeu , and parolles it is the count rousillon , my good lord , young bertram .
youth , thou thy father face , frank nature , rather curious than in haste , hath well composed thee .
thy father moral parts mayst thou inherit too !
welcome to paris .
my thanks and duty are your majesty .
i would i had that corporal soundness now , as when thy father and myself in friendship first tried our soldiership !
he did look far into the service of the time and was discipled of the bravest he lasted long , but on us both did haggish age steal on and wore us out of act .
it much repairs me to talk of your good father .
in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe in our young lords , but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour , so like a courtier , contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness , if they were , his equal had awaked them , and his honour , clock to itself , knew the true minute when exception bid him speak , and at this time his tongue obey his hand who were below him he used as creatures of another place and bow his eminent top to their low ranks , making them proud of his humility , in their poor praise he humbled .
such a man might be a copy to these younger times , which , follow well , would demonstrate them now but goers backward .
his good remembrance , sir , lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb , so in approof lives not his epitaph as in your royal speech .
would i were with him !
he would always say methinks i hear him now , his plausive words he scatter not in ears , but grafted them , to grow there and to bear , me not live , ' this his good melancholy oft began , on the catastrophe and heel of pastime , when it was out , me not live , ' quoth he , my flame lacks oil , to be the snuff of younger spirits , whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain , whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments , whose constancies expire before their fashions . '
this he wish , i after him do after him wish too , since i nor wax nor honey can bring home , i quickly were dissolved from my hive , to give some labourers room .
you are loved , sir they that least lend it you shall lack you first .
i fill a place , i .
how long , count , since the physician at your father died ?
he was much famed .
some six months since , my lord .
if he were living , i would try him yet .
lend me an arm , the rest have worn me out with several applications , nature and sickness debate it at their leisure .
welcome , count , my son no dearer .
thank your majesty .

madam , the care i have had to even your content , i wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours , for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings , when of ourselves we publish them .
what does this knave here ?
get you gone , sirrah the complaints i have heard of you i do not all believe is my slowness that i do not , for i know you lack not folly to commit them , and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours .
is not unknown to you , madam , i am a poor fellow .
well , sir .
no , madam , is not so well that i am poor , though many of the rich are damned but , if i may have your ladyship good will to go to the world , isbel the woman and i will do as we may .
wilt thou needs be a beggar ?
i do beg your good will in this case .
in what case ?
in isbel case and mine own .
service is no heritage and i think i shall never have the blessing of god till i have issue o ' my body , for they say barnes are blessings .
tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry .
my poor body , madam , requires it i am driven on by the flesh , and he must needs go that the devil drives .
is this all your worship reason ?
faith , madam , i have other holy reasons such as they are .
may the world know them ?
i have been , madam , a wicked creature , as you and all flesh and blood are , and , indeed , i do marry that i may repent .
thy marriage , sooner than thy wickedness .
i am out o ' friends , madam , and i hope to have friends for my wife sake .
such friends are thine enemies , knave .
you shallow , madam , in great friends , for the knaves come to do that for me which i am aweary of .
he that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop , if i be his cuckold , he my drudge he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood , he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood , he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend ergo , he that kisses my wife is my friend .
if men could be contented to be what they are , there were no fear in marriage , for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the papist , their hearts are severed in religion , their heads are both one , they may jowl horns together , like any deer i ' the herd .
wilt thou ever be a and calumnious knave ?
a prophet i , madam , and i speak the truth the next way for i the ballad will repeat , which men full true shall find , your marriage comes by destiny , your cuckoo sings by kind .
get you gone , sir , i talk with you more anon .
may it please you , madam , that he bid helen come to you of her i am to speak .
sirrah , tell my gentlewoman i would speak with her , helen , i mean .
was this fair face the cause , quoth she , why the grecians sacked troy ?
fond done , done fond , was this king priam joy ?
with that she sighed as she stood , with that she sighed as she stood , and gave this sentence then , among nine bad if one be good , among nine bad if one be good , there yet one good in ten .
what , one good in ten ?
you corrupt the song , sirrah .
one good woman in ten , madam , which is a purifying o ' the song would god would serve the world so all the year !
find no fault with the , if i were the parson .
one in ten , quoth a ' !
an we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star , or at an earthquake , mend the lottery well a man may draw his heart out , ere a ' pluck one .
you be gone , sir knave , and do as i command you .
that man should be at woman command , and yet no hurt done !
though honesty be no puritan , yet it will do no hurt , it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart .
i am going , forsooth the business is for helen to come hither .
exit well , now .
i know , madam , you love your gentlewoman entirely .
faith , i do her father bequeathed her to me , and she herself , without other advantage , may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds there is more owing her than is paid , and more shall be paid her than she demand .
madam , i was very late more near her than i think she wished me alone she was , and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears , she thought , i dare vow for her , they touched not any stranger sense .
her matter was , she loved your son fortune , she said , was no goddess , that had put such difference betwixt their two estates , love no god , that would not extend his might , only where qualities were level , dian no queen of virgins , that would suffer her poor knight surprised , without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward .
this she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that i heard virgin exclaim in which i held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal , sithence , in the loss that may happen , it concerns you something to know it .
you have discharged this honestly , keep it to yourself many likelihoods informed me of this before , which hung so tottering in the balance that i could neither believe nor misdoubt .
pray you , leave me stall this in your bosom , and i thank you for your honest care i will speak with you further anon .
exit steward enter helena even so it was with me when i was young if ever we are nature , these are ours , this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong , our blood to us , this to our blood is born , it is the show and seal of nature truth , where love strong passion is impress in youth by our remembrances of days foregone , such were our faults , or then we thought them none .
her eye is sick o i observe her now .
what is your pleasure , madam ?
you know , helen , i am a mother to you .
mine honourable mistress .
nay , a mother why not a mother ?
when i said ' a mother , ' methought you saw a serpent what in , ' that you start at it ?
i say , i am your mother , and put you in the catalogue of those that were enwombed mine is often seen adoption strives with nature and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds you oppress me with a mother groan , yet i express to you a mother care god mercy , maiden !
does it curd thy blood to say i am thy mother ?
what the matter , that this distemper messenger of wet , the iris , rounds thine eye ?
why ?
that you are my daughter ?
that i am not .
i say , i am your mother .
pardon , madam , the count rousillon can not be my brother i am from humble , he from honour name , no note upon my parents , his all noble my master , my dear lord he is , and i his servant live , and will his vassal die he must not be my brother .
nor i your mother ?
you are my mother , madam , would you were , so that my lord your son were not my brother , indeed my mother !
or were you both our mothers , i care no more for than i do for heaven , so i were not his sister .
ca no other , but , i your daughter , he must be my brother ?
yes , helen , you might be my god shield you mean it not !
daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse .
what , pale again ?
my fear hath catch your fondness now i see the mystery of your loneliness , and find your salt tears ' head now to all sense is gross you love my son , invention is ashamed , against the proclamation of thy passion , to say thou dost not therefore tell me true , but tell me then , is so , for , look thy cheeks confess it , th ' one to th ' other , and thine eyes see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors that in their kind they speak it only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue , that truth should be suspected .
speak , so ?
if it be so , you have wound a goodly clew , if it be not , , i charge thee , as heaven shall work in me for thine avail , tell me truly .
good madam , pardon me !
do you love my son ?
your pardon , noble mistress !
love you my son ?
do not you love him , madam ?
go not about , my love hath i a bond , whereof the world takes note come , come , disclose the state of your affection , for your passions have to the full appeach .
then , i confess , here on my knee , before high heaven and you , that before you , and next unto high heaven , i love your son .
my friends were poor , but honest , so my love be not offended , for it hurts not him that he is loved of me i follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit , nor would i have him till i do deserve him , yet never know how that desert should be .
i know i love in vain , strive against hope , yet in this captious and intenible sieve i still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still thus , , religious in mine error , i adore the sun , that looks upon his worshipper , but knows of him no more .
my dearest madam , let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do but if yourself , whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth , did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly , that your dian was both herself and love o , then , give pity to her , whose state is such that can not choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose , that seeks not to find that her search implies , but lives sweetly where she dies !
had you not lately an intent , speak truly , to go to paris ?
madam , i had .
wherefore ?
tell true .
i will tell truth , by grace itself i swear .
you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and proved effects , such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty , and that he will me in reservation to bestow them , as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note amongst the rest , there is a remedy , approved , set down , to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is render lost .
this was your motive for paris , was it ?
speak .
my lord your son made me to think of this , else paris and the medicine and the king had from the conversation of my thoughts haply been absent then .
but think you , helen , if you should tender your supposed aid , he would receive it ?
he and his physicians are of a mind , he , that they can not help him , they , that they can not help how shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin , when the schools , embowell of their doctrine , have left off the danger to itself ?
there something i , more than my father skill , which was the greatest of his profession , that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by the luckiest stars in heaven and , would your honour but give me leave to try success , venture the life of mine on his grace cure by such a day and hour .
dost thou ?
ay , madam , knowingly .
why , helen , thou shalt have my leave and love , means and attendants and my loving greetings to those of mine in court i stay at home and pray god blessing into thy attempt be gone , and be sure of this , what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss .

commit it , count .
i am your accessary , and so , farewell .
i grow to you , and our parting is a tortured body .
farewell , captain .
sweet monsieur parolles !
noble heroes , my sword and yours are kin .
good sparks and lustrous , a word , good metals you shall find in the regiment of the spinii one captain spurio , with his cicatrice , an emblem of war , here on his sinister cheek , it was this very sword entrenched it say to him , i live , and observe his reports for me .
we shall , noble captain .
exeunt lords mars dote on you for his novices !
what will ye do ?
stay the king .
king .
bertram and parolles retire to bertram use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords , you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu be more expressive to them for they wear themselves in the cap of the time , there do muster true gait , eat , speak , and move under the influence of the most received star , and though the devil lead the measure , such are to be followed after them , and take a more dilated farewell .
and i will do so .
worthy fellows , and like to prove most sinewy .
exeunt bertram and parolles enter lafeu kneeling pardon , my lord , for me and for my tidings .
i fee thee to stand up .
then here a man stands , that has brought his pardon .
i would you had kneel , my lord , to ask me mercy , and that at my bidding you could so stand up .
i would i had , so i had broke thy pate , and ask thee mercy .
good faith , across but , my good lord is thus , will you be cured of your infirmity ?
no .
o , will you eat no grapes , my royal fox ?
yes , but you will my noble grapes , an if my royal fox could reach them i have seen a medicine that able to breathe life into a stone , quicken a rock , and make you dance canary with spritely fire and motion , whose simple touch , is powerful to araise king pepin , nay , to give great charlemain a pen in hand , and write to her a .
what ' is this ?
why , doctor she my lord , there one arrived , if you will see her now , by my faith and honour , if seriously i may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance , i have spoke with one that , in her sex , her years , profession , wisdom and constancy , hath amazed me more than i dare blame my weakness will you see her for that is her demand , and know her business ?
that done , laugh well at me .
now , good lafeu , bring in the admiration , that we with thee may spend our wonder too , or take off thine by wondering how thou it .
nay , i fit you , and not be all day neither .
exit thus he his special nothing ever prologues .
lafeu , with helena nay , come your ways .
this haste hath wings indeed .
nay , come your ways this is his majesty , say your mind to him a traitor you do look like , but such traitors his majesty seldom fears i am cressid uncle , that dare leave two together , fare you well .
exit now , fair one , does your business follow us ?
ay , my good lord .
gerard de narbon was my father , in what he did profess , well found .
i knew him .
the rather will i spare my praises towards him knowing him is enough .
on bed of death many receipts he gave me chiefly one .
which , as the dearest issue of his practise , and of his old experience the oily darling , he bade me store up , as a triple eye , safer than mine own two , more dear , i have so , and hearing your high majesty is touch with that malignant cause wherein the honour of my dear father gift stands chief in power , i come to tender it and my appliance with all bound humbleness .
we thank you , maiden , but may not be so credulous of cure , when our most learned doctors leave us and the congregated college have concluded that labouring art can never ransom nature from her inaidible estate , i say we must not so stain our judgment , or corrupt our hope , to prostitute our malady to empirics , or to dissever so our great self and our credit , to esteem a senseless help when help past sense we deem .
my duty then shall pay me for my pains i will no more enforce mine office on you .
humbly entreating from your royal thoughts a modest one , to bear me back again .
i can not give thee less , to be call grateful thou to help me , and such thanks i give as one near death to those that wish him live but what at full i know , thou no part , i knowing all my peril , thou no art .
what i can do can do no hurt to try , since you set up your rest remedy .
he that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown , when judges have been babes , great floods have flown from simple sources , and great seas have dried when miracles have by the greatest been denied .
oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises , and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits .
i must not hear thee , fare thee well , kind maid , thy pains not used must by thyself be paid proffers not took reap thanks for their reward .
inspired merit so by breath is barr it is not so with him that all things knows as is with us that square our guess by shows , but most it is presumption in us when the help of heaven we count the act of men .
dear sir , to my endeavours give consent , of heaven , not me , make an experiment .
i am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim , but know i think and think i know most sure my art is not past power nor you past cure .
are thou so confident ?
within what space hopest thou my cure ?
the grace lending grace ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring their fiery torcher his diurnal ring , ere twice in murk and occidental damp moist hesperus hath quench his sleepy lamp , or four and twenty times the pilot glass hath told the thievish minutes how they pass , what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly , health shall live free and sickness freely die .
upon thy certainty and confidence what darest thou venture ?
tax of impudence , a strumpet boldness , a divulged shame traduced by odious ballads my maiden name sear otherwise , nay , worse if worse extended with vilest torture let my life be ended .
methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak his powerful sound within an organ weak and what impossibility would slay in common sense , sense saves another way .
thy life is dear , for all that life can rate worth name of life in thee hath estimate , youth , beauty , wisdom , courage , all that happiness and prime can happy call thou this to hazard needs must intimate skill infinite or monstrous desperate .
sweet practiser , thy physic i will try , that ministers thine own death if i die .
if i break time , or flinch in property of what i spoke , unpitied let me die , and well deserved not helping , death my fee , but , if i help , what do you promise me ?
make thy demand .
but will you make it even ?
ay , by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven .
then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand what husband in thy power i will command exempted be from me the arrogance to choose from forth the royal blood of france , my low and humble name to propagate with any branch or image of thy state , but such a one , thy vassal , whom i know is free for me to ask , thee to bestow .
here is my hand , the premises observed , thy will by my performance shall be served so make the choice of thy own time , for i , thy resolved patient , on thee still rely .
more should i question thee , and more i must , though more to know could not be more to trust , from whence thou camest , how tended on but rest unquestion welcome and undoubted blest .
give me some help here , ho !
if thou proceed as high as word , my deed shall match thy meed .

rousillon .
the count palace .
enter countess and clown come on , sir , i shall now put you to the height of your breeding .
i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught i know my business is but to the court .
to the court !
why , what place make you special , when you put off that with such contempt ?
but to the court !
truly , madam , if god have lent a man any manners , he may easily put it off at court he that can not make a leg , put off cap , kiss his hand and say nothing , has neither leg , hands , lip , nor cap , and indeed such a fellow , to say precisely , were not for the court , but for me , i have an answer will serve all men .
marry , that a bountiful answer that fits all questions .
it is like a barber chair that fits all buttocks , the , the , the brawn buttock , or any buttock .
will your answer serve fit to all questions ?
as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney , as your french crown for your taffeta punk , as tib rush for tom forefinger , as a pancake for shrove tuesday , a morris for , as the nail to his hole , the cuckold to his horn , as a scolding queen to a wrangling knave , as the nun lip to the friar mouth , nay , as the pudding to his skin .
have you , i say , an answer of such fitness for all questions ?
from below your duke to beneath your constable , it will fit any question .
it must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands .
but a trifle neither , in good faith , if the learned should speak truth of it here it is , and all that belongs .
ask me if i am a courtier it shall do you no harm to learn .
to be young again , if we could i will be a fool in question , hoping to be the wiser by your answer .
i pray you , sir , are you a courtier ?
o lord , sir !
there a simple putting off .
more , more , a hundred of them .
sir , i am a poor friend of yours , that loves you .
o lord , sir !
thick , thick , spare not me .
i think , sir , you can eat none of this homely meat .
o lord , sir !
nay , put me , i warrant you .
you were lately whipped , sir , as i think .
o lord , sir !
spare not me .
do you cry , ' o lord , sir ! '
at your whipping , and not me ? '
indeed your ' o lord , sir ! '
is very sequent to your whipping you would answer very well to a whipping , if you were but bound .
i had worse luck in my life in my ' o lord , sir ! '
i see things may serve long , but not serve ever .
i play the noble housewife with the time to entertai so merrily with a fool .
o lord , sir !
why , serves well again .
an end , sir , to your business .
give helen this , and urge her to a present answer back commend me to my kinsmen and my son this is not much .
not much commendation to them .
not much employment for you you understand me ?
most fruitfully i am there before my legs .
haste you again .
exeunt severally scene iii .
paris .
the king palace .
enter bertram , lafeu , and parolles they say miracles are past , and we have our philosophical persons , to make modern and familiar , things supernatural and causeless .
hence is it that we make trifles of terrors , ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge , when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear .
why , is the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times .
and so is .
to be relinquish of the artists , so i say .
both of galen and paracelsus .
so i say .
of all the learned and authentic fellows , right , so i say .
that gave him out incurable , why , there is , so say i too .
not to be helped , right , as , a man assured of a uncertain life , and sure death .
just , you say well , so would i have said .
i may truly say , it is a novelty to the world .
it is , indeed if you will have it in showing , you shall read it in what do you call there ?
a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor .
that it , i would have said the very same .
why , your dolphin is not lustier me , i speak in respect nay , is strange , is very strange , that is the brief and the tedious of it , and he of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the very hand of heaven .
ay , so i say .
in a most weak pausing and debile minister , great power , great transcendence which should , indeed , give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king , as to be pausing generally thankful .
i would have said it , you say well .
here comes the king .
enter king , helena , and attendants .
lafeu and parolles retire lustig , as the dutchman says i like a maid the better , whilst i have a tooth in my head why , he able to lead her a coranto .
mort du vinaigre !
is not this helen ?
god , i think so .
go , call before me all the lords in court .
sit , my preserver , by thy patient side , and with this healthful hand , whose banish sense thou hast repeal , a second time receive the confirmation of my promised gift , which but attends thy naming .
enter three or four lords fair maid , send forth thine eye this youthful parcel of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing , whom both sovereign power and father voice i have to use thy frank election make , thou hast power to choose , and they none to forsake .
to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress fall , when love please !
marry , to each , but one !
give bay curtal and his furniture , my mouth no more were broken than these boys ' , and writ as little beard .
peruse them well not one of those but had a noble father .
gentlemen , heaven hath through me restored the king to health .
we understand it , and thank heaven for you .
i am a simple maid , and therein wealthiest , that i protest i simply am a maid .
please it your majesty , i have done already the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me , blush that thou shouldst choose , but , be refused , let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever , we come there again . '
make choice , and , see , who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me .
now , dian , from thy altar do i fly , and to imperial love , that god most high , do my sighs stream .
sir , will you hear my suit ?
and grant it .
thanks , sir , all the rest is mute .
i had rather be in this choice than throw for my life .
the honour , sir , that flames in your fair eyes , before i speak , too threateningly replies love make your fortunes twenty times above her that so wishes and her humble love !
no better , if you please .
my wish receive , which great love grant !
and so , i take my leave .
do all they deny her ?
an they were sons of mine , i have them whipped , or i would send them to the turk , to make eunuchs of .
be not afraid that i your hand should take , i never do you wrong for your own sake blessing upon your vows !
and in your bed find fairer fortune , if you ever wed !
these boys are boys of ice , they none have her sure , they are bastards to the english , the french got .
you are too young , too happy , and too good , to make yourself a son out of my blood .
fair one , i think not so .
there one grape yet , i am sure thy father drunk wine but if thou not an ass , i am a youth of fourteen , i have known thee already .
to bertram i dare not say i take you , but i give me and my service , ever whilst i live , into your guiding power .
this is the man .
why , then , young bertram , take her , she thy wife .
my wife , my liege !
i shall beseech your highness , in such a business give me leave to use the help of mine own eyes .
thou not , bertram , what she has done for me ?
yes , my good lord , but never hope to know why i should marry her .
thou she has raised me from my sickly bed .
but follows it , my lord , to bring me down must answer for your raising ?
i know her well she had her breeding at my father charge .
a poor physician daughter my wife !
disdain rather corrupt me ever !
is only title thou in her , the which i can build up .
strange is it that our bloods , of colour , weight , and heat , pour all together , would quite confound distinction , yet stand off in differences so mighty .
if she be all that is virtuous , save what thou dislikest , a poor physician daughter , thou dislikest of virtue for the name but do not so from lowest place when virtuous things proceed , the place is dignified by the doer deed where great additions swell , and virtue none , it is a dropsied honour .
good alone is good without a name .
vileness is so the property by what it is should go , not by the title .
she is young , wise , fair , in these to nature she immediate heir , and these breed honour that is honour scorn , which challenges itself as honour born and is not like the sire honours thrive , when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers the mere word a slave debosh on every tomb , on every grave a lying trophy , and as oft is dumb where dust and damn oblivion is the tomb of honour bones indeed .
what should be said ?
if thou canst like this creature as a maid , i can create the rest virtue and she is her own dower , honour and wealth from me .
i can not love her , nor will strive to .
thou thyself , if thou shouldst strive to choose .
that you are well restored , my lord , i glad let the rest go .
my honour at the stake , which to defeat , i must produce my power .
here , take her hand , proud scornful boy , unworthy this good gift , that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert , that canst not dream , we , poising us in her defective scale , shall weigh thee to the beam , that wilt not know , it is in us to plant thine honour where we please to have it grow .
cheque thy contempt obey our will , which travails in thy good believe not thy disdain , but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims , or i will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance , both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee , in the name of justice , without all terms of pity .
speak , thine answer .
pardon , my gracious lord , for i submit my fancy to your eyes when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it , i find that she , which late was in my nobler thoughts most base , is now the praised of the king , who , so ennobled , is as born so .
take her by the hand , and tell her she is thine to whom i promise a counterpoise , if not to thy estate a balance more replete .
i take her hand .
good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract , whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the brief , and be perform the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space , expecting absent friends .
as thou lovest her , thy love to me religious , else , does err .
exeunt all but lafeu and parolles advancing do you hear , monsieur ?
a word with you .
your pleasure , sir ?
your lord and master did well to make his recantation .
recantation !
my lord !
my master !
ay , is it not a language i speak ?
a most harsh one , and not to be understood without bloody succeeding .
my master !
are you companion to the count rousillon ?
to any count , to all counts , to what is man .
to what is count man count master is of another style .
you are too old , sir , let it satisfy you , you are too old .
i must tell thee , sirrah , i write man , to which title age can not bring thee .
what i dare too well do , i dare not do .
i did think thee , for two ordinaries , to be a pretty wise fellow , thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel , it might pass yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen .
i have now found thee , when i lose thee again , i care not yet art thou good for nothing but taking up , and that scarce worth .
hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee , do not plunge thyself too far in anger , lest thou hasten thy trial , which if lord have mercy on thee for a hen !
so , my good window of lattice , fare thee well thy casement i need not open , for i look through thee .
give me thy hand .
my lord , you give me most egregious indignity .
ay , with all my heart , and thou art worthy of it .
i have not , my lord , deserved it .
yes , good faith , every dram of it , and i will not bate thee a scruple .
well , i shall be wiser .
even as soon as thou canst , for thou hast to pull at a smack o ' the contrary .
if ever thou bound in thy scarf and beaten , thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage .
i have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee , or rather my knowledge , that i may say in the default , he is a man i know .
my lord , you do me most insupportable vexation .
i would it were for thy sake , and my poor doing eternal for doing i am past as i will by thee , in what motion age will give me leave .
exit well , thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me , scurvy , old , filthy , scurvy lord !
well , i must be patient , there is no fettering of authority .
i beat him , by my life , if i can meet him with any convenience , an he were double and double a lord .
i have no more pity of his age than i would of i beat him , an if i could but meet him again .
lafeu sirrah , your lord and master married , there news for you you have a new mistress .
i most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs he is my good lord whom i serve above is my master .
who ?
god ?
ay , sir .
the devil it is that thy master .
why dost thou garter up thy arms o ' this fashion ?
dost make hose of sleeves ?
do other servants so ?
thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands .
by mine honour , if i were but two hours younger , beat thee methinks , thou art a general offence , and every man should beat thee i think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee .
this is hard and undeserved measure , my lord .
go to , sir , you were beaten in italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate , you are a vagabond and no true traveller you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry .
you are not worth another word , else call you knave .
i leave you .
exit good , very good , it is so then good , very good , let it be concealed awhile .
bertram undone , and forfeited to cares for ever !
what the matter , ?
although before the solemn priest i have sworn , i will not bed her .
what , what , ?
o my parolles , they have married me !
i to the tuscan wars , and never bed her .
france is a , and it no more merits the tread of a man foot to the wars !
there letters from my mother what the import is , i know not yet .
ay , that would be known .
to the wars , my boy , to the wars !
he wears his honour in a box unseen , that hugs his here at home , spending his manly marrow in her arms , which should sustain the bound and high curvet of mars fiery steed .
to other regions france is a stable , we that dwell i jades , therefore , to the war !
it shall be so i send her to my house , acquaint my mother with my hate to her , and wherefore i am fled , write to the king that which i durst not speak , his present gift shall furnish me to those italian fields , where noble fellows strike war is no strife to the dark house and the detested wife .
will this capriccio hold in thee ?
art sure ?
go with me to my chamber , and advise me .
i send her straight away i to the wars , she to her single sorrow .
why , these balls bound , there noise in it .
is hard a young man married is a man that marr therefore away , and leave her bravely , go the king has done you wrong but , hush , is so .

she is not well , but yet she has her health she very merry , but yet she is not well but thanks be given , she very well and wants nothing i ' , the world , but yet she is not well .
if she be very well , what does she ail , that she not very well ?
truly , she very well indeed , but for two things .
what two things ?
one , that she not in heaven , whither god send her quickly !
the other that she in earth , from whence god send her quickly !
enter parolles bless you , my fortunate lady !
i hope , sir , i have your good will to have mine own good fortunes .
you had my prayers to lead them on , and to keep them on , have them still .
o , my knave , how does my old lady ?
so that you had her wrinkles and i her money , i would she did as you say .
why , i say nothing .
marry , you are the wiser man , for many a man tongue shakes out his master undoing to say nothing , to do nothing , to know nothing , and to have nothing , is to be a great part of your title , which is within a very little of nothing .
away !
a knave .
you should have said , sir , before a knave a knave , that , before me a knave this had been truth , sir .
go to , thou art a witty fool , i have found thee .
did you find me in yourself , sir ?
or were you taught to find me ?
the search , sir , was profitable , and much fool may you find in you , even to the world pleasure and the increase of laughter .
a good knave , i ' faith , and well fed .
madam , my lord will go away , a very serious business calls on him .
the great prerogative and rite of love , which , as your due , time claims , he does acknowledge , but puts it off to a compell restraint , whose want , and whose delay , is strew with sweets , which they distil now in the curbed time , to make the coming hour with joy and pleasure drown the brim .
what his will else ?
that you will take your instant leave o ' the king and make this haste as your own good proceeding , strengthen with what apology you think may make it probable need .
what more commands he ?
that , having this obtain , you presently attend his further pleasure .
in every thing i wait upon his will .
i shall report it so .

and by other warranted testimony .
then my dial goes not true i took this lark for a bunting .
i do assure you , my lord , he is very great in knowledge and accordingly valiant .
i have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour , and my state that way is dangerous , since i can not yet find in my heart to repent .
here he comes i pray you , make us friends , i will pursue the amity .
enter parolles to bertram these things shall be done , sir .
pray you , sir , who his tailor ?
sir ?
o , i know him well , i , sir , he , sir , a good workman , a very good tailor .
aside to parolles is she gone to the king ?
she is .
will she away ?
as you have her .
i have writ my letters , casketed my treasure , given order for our horses , and , when i should take possession of the bride , end ere i do begin .
a good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner , but one that lies three thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with , should be once heard and thrice beaten .
god save you , captain .
is there any unkindness between my lord and you , monsieur ?
i know not how i have deserved to run into my lord displeasure .
you have made shift to run into , boots and spurs and all , like him that leaped into the custard , and out of it you run again , rather than suffer question for your residence .
it may be you have mistaken him , my lord .
and shall do so ever , though i took him at prayers .
fare you well , my lord , and believe this of me , there can be no kernel in this light nut , the soul of this man is his clothes .
trust him not in matter of heavy consequence , i have kept of them tame , and know their natures .
farewell , monsieur i have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand , but we must do good against evil .
exit an idle lord .
i swear .
i think so .
why , do you not know him ?
yes , i do know him well , and common speech gives him a worthy pass .
here comes my clog .
enter helena i have , sir , as i was commanded from you , spoke with the king and have procured his leave for present parting , only he desires some private speech with you .
i shall obey his will .
you must not marvel , helen , at my course , which holds not colour with the time , nor does the ministration and required office on my particular .
prepared i was not for such a business , therefore am i found so much unsettled this drives me to entreat you that presently you take our way for home , and rather muse than ask why i entreat you , for my respects are better than they seem and my appointments have in them a need greater than shows itself at the first view to you that know them not .
this to my mother giving a letter be two days ere i shall see you , so i leave you to your wisdom .
sir , i can nothing say , but that i am your most obedient servant .
come , come , no more of that .
and ever shall with true observance seek to eke out that wherein toward me my homely stars have fail to equal my great fortune .
let that go my haste is very great farewell , hie home .
pray , sir , your pardon .
well , what would you say ?
i am not worthy of the wealth i owe , nor dare i say is mine , and yet it is , but , like a timorous thief , most fain would steal what law does vouch mine own .
what would you have ?
something , and scarce so much nothing , indeed .
i would not tell you what i would , my lord faith yes , strangers and foes do sunder , and not kiss .
i pray you , stay not , but in haste to horse .
i shall not break your bidding , good my lord .
where are my other men , monsieur ?
farewell .
exit helena go thou toward home , where i will never come whilst i can shake my sword or hear the drum .
away , and for our flight .

so that from point to point now have you heard the fundamental reasons of this war , whose great decision hath much blood let forth and more thirsts after .
holy seems the quarrel upon your grace part , black and fearful on the opposer .
therefore we marvel much our cousin france would in so just a business shut his bosom against our borrowing prayers .
good my lord , the reasons of our state i can not yield , but like a common and an outward man , that the great figure of a council frames by motion therefore dare not say what i think of it , since i have found myself in my incertain grounds to fail as often as i guess .
be it his pleasure .
but i am sure the younger of our nature , that surfeit on their ease , will day by day come here for physic .
welcome shall they be , and all the honours that can fly from us shall on them settle .

to fly the favours of so good a king , to pluck his indignation on thy head by the misprising of a maid too virtuous for the contempt of empire .
clown o madam , yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady !
what is the matter ?
nay , there is some comfort in the news , some comfort , your son will not be killed so soon as i thought he would .
why should he be killed ?
so say i , madam , if he run away , as i hear he does the danger is in standing , that the loss of men , though it be the getting of children .
here they come will tell you more for my part , i only hear your son was run away .
exit enter helena , and two gentlemen save you , good madam .
madam , my lord is gone , for ever gone .
do not say so .
think upon patience .
pray you , gentlemen , i have felt so many quirks of joy and grief , that the first face of neither , on the start , can woman me where is my son , i pray you ?
madam , he gone to serve the duke of florence we met him thitherward , for thence we came , and , after some dispatch in hand at court , thither we bend again .
look on his letter , madam , here my passport .
reads when thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off , and show me a child begotten of thy body that i am father to , then call me husband but in such a ' i write a . '
this is a dreadful sentence .
brought you this letter , gentlemen ?
ay , madam , and for the contents ' sake are sorry for our pain .
i prithee , lady , have a better cheer , if thou engrossest all the griefs are thine , thou me of a moiety he was my son , but i do wash his name out of my blood , and thou art all my child .
towards florence is he ?
ay , madam .
and to be a soldier ?
such is his noble purpose , and believe , the duke will lay upon him all the honour that good convenience claims .
return you thither ?
ay , madam , with the swiftest wing of speed .
reads till i have no wife i have nothing in france .
is bitter .
find you that there ?
ay , madam .
is but the boldness of his hand , haply , which his heart was not consenting to .
nothing in france , until he have no wife !
there nothing here that is too good for him but only she , and she deserves a lord that twenty such rude boys might tend upon and call her hourly mistress .
who was with him ?
a servant only , and a gentleman which i have sometime known .
parolles , was it not ?
ay , my good lady , he .
a very tainted fellow , and full of wickedness .
my son corrupts a nature with his inducement .
indeed , good lady , the fellow has a deal of that too much , which holds him much to have .
you welcome , gentlemen .
i will entreat you , when you see my son , to tell him that his sword can never win the honour that he loses more i entreat you written to bear along .
we serve you , madam , in that and all your worthiest affairs .
not so , but as we change our courtesies .
will you draw near !
exeunt countess and gentlemen i have no wife , i have nothing in france . '
nothing in france , until he has no wife !
thou shalt have none , rousillon , none in france , then hast thou all again .
poor lord !
i that chase thee from thy country and expose those tender limbs of thine to the event of the war ?
and is it i that drive thee from the sportive court , where thou wast shot at with fair eyes , to be the mark of smoky muskets ?
o you leaden messengers , that ride upon the violent speed of fire , fly with false aim , move the air , that sings with piercing , do not touch my lord .
whoever shoots at him , i set him there , whoever charges on his forward breast , i am the caitiff that do hold him , and , though i kill him not , i am the cause his death was so effected better i met the ravin lion when he roar with sharp constraint of hunger , better that all the miseries which nature owes were mine at once .
no , come thou home , rousillon , whence honour but of danger wins a scar , as oft it loses all i will be gone , my being here it is that holds thee hence shall i stay here to ?
no , no , although the air of paradise did fan the house and angels officed all i will be gone , that pitiful rumour may report my flight , to consolate thine ear .
come , night , end , day !
for with the dark , poor thief , i steal away .

write , write , that from the bloody course of war my dearest master , your dear son , may hie bless him at home in peace , whilst i from far his name with zealous fervor sanctify his taken labours bid him me forgive , i , his despiteful juno , sent him forth from courtly friends , with camping foes to live , where death and danger dogs the heels of worth he is too good and fair for death and me whom i myself embrace , to set him free .
ah , what sharp stings are in her mildest words !
rinaldo , you did never lack advice so much , as letting her pass so had i spoke with her , i could have well diverted her intents , which thus she hath prevented .
pardon me , madam if i had given you this at , she might have been , and yet she writes , pursuit would be but vain .
what angel shall bless this unworthy husband ?
he can not thrive , unless her prayers , whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant , reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice .
write , write , rinaldo , to this unworthy husband of his wife , let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light my greatest grief .
though little he do feel it , set down sharply .
dispatch the most convenient messenger when haply he shall hear that she is gone , he will return , and hope i may that she , hearing so much , will speed her foot again , led hither by pure love which of them both is dearest to me .

they say the french count has done most honourable service .
it is reported that he has taken their greatest commander , and that with his own hand he slew the duke brother .
tucket we have lost our labour , they are gone a contrary way hark !
you may know by their trumpets .
come , let return again , and suffice ourselves with the report of it .
well , diana , take heed of this french earl the honour of a maid is her name , and no legacy is so rich as honesty .
i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion .
i know that knave , hang him !
one parolles a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl .
beware of them , diana , their promises , enticements , oaths , tokens , and all these engines of lust , are not the things they go under many a maid hath been seduced by them , and the misery is , example , that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood , can not for all that dissuade succession , but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them .
i hope i need not to advise you further , but i hope your own grace will keep you where you are , though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost .
you shall not need to fear me .
i hope so .
enter helena , disguised like a pilgrim look , here comes a pilgrim i know she will lie at my house , thither they send one another i question her .
god save you , pilgrim !
whither are you bound ?

at the saint francis here beside the port .
is this the way ?
ay , marry , .

if you will tarry , holy pilgrim , but till the troops come by , i will conduct you where you shall be lodged , the rather , for i think i know your hostess as ample as myself .
is it yourself ?
if you shall please so , pilgrim .
i thank you , and will stay upon your leisure .
you came , i think , from france ?
i did so .
here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service .
his name , i pray you .
the count rousillon know you such a one ?
but by the ear , that hears most nobly of him his face i know not .
he is , he bravely taken here .
he stole from france , as is reported , for the king had married him against his liking think you it is so ?
ay , surely , mere the truth i know his lady .
there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her .
what his name ?
monsieur parolles .
o , i believe with him , in argument of praise , or to the worth of the great count himself , she is too mean to have her name repeated all her deserving is a reserved honesty , and that i have not heard examined .
alas , poor lady !
is a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord .
i warrant , good creature , she is , her heart weighs sadly this young maid might do her a shrewd turn , if she pleased .
how do you mean ?
may be the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose .
he does indeed , and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid but she is arm for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence .
the gods forbid else !
so , now they come drum and colours enter bertram , parolles , and the whole army that is antonio , the duke eldest son , that , escalus .
which is the frenchman ?
he , that with the plume is a most gallant fellow .
i would he loved his wife if he were honester he were much goodlier not a handsome gentleman ?
i like him well .
is pity he is not honest yond that same knave that leads him to these places were i his lady , i would poison that vile rascal .
which is he ?

perchance he hurt i ' the battle .

we take your offer kindly .
exeunt scene vi .
camp before florence .
enter bertram and the two french lords nay , good my lord , put him , let him have his way .
if your lordship find him not a hilding , hold me no more in your respect .
on my life , my lord , a bubble .
do you think i am so far deceived in him ?
believe it , my lord , in mine own direct knowledge , without any malice , but to speak of him as my kinsman , he a most notable coward , an infinite and endless liar , an hourly , the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship entertainment .
it were fit you knew him , lest , reposing too far in his virtue , which he hath not , he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you .
i would i knew in what particular action to try him .
none better than to let him fetch off his drum , which you hear him so confidently undertake to do .
i , with a troop of florentines , will suddenly surprise him , such i will have , whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink him so , that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries , when we bring him to our own tents .
be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not , for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear , offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you , and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath , never trust my judgment in any thing .
o , for the love of laughter , let him fetch his drum , he says he has a stratagem when your lordship sees the bottom of his success i , and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted , if you give him not john drum entertainment , your inclining can not be removed .
here he comes .
enter parolles aside to bertram o , for the love of laughter , hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand .
how now , monsieur !
this drum sticks sorely in your disposition .
a pox o , let it go , is but a drum .
a drum ' !
a drum ' ?
a drum so lost !
there was excellent command , to charge in with our horse upon our own wings , and to rend our own soldiers !
that was not to be blamed in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not have prevented , if he had been there to command .
well , we can not greatly condemn our success some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum , but it is not to be recovered .
it might have been recovered .
it might , but it is not now .
it is to be recovered but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer , i would have that drum or another , or jacet . '
why , if you have a stomach , , monsieur if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter , be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on , i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you speed well in it , the duke shall both speak of it .
and extend to you what further becomes his greatness , even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness .
by the hand of a soldier , i will undertake it .
but you must not now slumber in it .
i about it this evening and i will presently pen down my dilemmas , encourage myself in my certainty , put myself into my mortal preparation , and by midnight look to hear further from me .
may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it ?
i know not what the success will be , my lord , but the attempt i vow .
i know valiant , and , to the possibility of thy soldiership , will subscribe for thee .
farewell .
i love not many words .
exit no more than a fish loves water .
is not this a strange fellow , my lord , that so confidently seems to undertake this business , which he knows is not to be done , damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to ?
you do not know him , my lord , as we do certain it is that he will steal himself into a man favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries , but when you find him out , you have him ever after .
why , do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto ?
none in the world , but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost embossed him , you shall see his fall , for indeed he is not for your lordship respect .
we make you some sport with the fox ere we case him .
he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu when his disguise and he is parted , tell me what a sprat you shall find him , which you shall see this very night .
i must go look my twigs he shall be caught .
your brother he shall go along with me .
please your lordship i leave you .
exit now will i lead you to the house , and show you the lass i spoke of .
but you say she honest .
that all the fault i spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold , but i sent to her , by this same coxcomb that we have i ' the wind , tokens and letters which she did , and this is all i have done .
she a fair creature will you go see her ?
with all my heart , my lord .

enter helena and widow if you misdoubt me that i am not she , i know not how i shall assure you further , but i shall lose the grounds i work upon .
though my estate be fallen , i was well born , nothing acquainted with these businesses , and would not put my reputation now in any staining act .
nor would i wish you .
first , give me trust , the count he is my husband , and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken is so from word to word , and then you can not , by the good aid that i of you shall borrow , err in bestowing it .
i should believe you for you have show me that which well approves you great in fortune .
take this purse of gold , and let me buy your friendly help thus far , which i will and pay again when i have found it .
the count he wooes your daughter , lays down his wanton siege before her beauty , resolved to carry her let her in fine consent , as we direct her how is best to bear it .
now his important blood will nought deny that she demand a ring the county wears , that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son , some four or five descents since the first father wore it this ring he holds in most rich choice , yet in his idle fire , to buy his will , it would not seem too dear , repented after .
now i see the bottom of your purpose .
you see it lawful , then it is no more , but that your daughter , ere she seems as won , desires this ring , appoints him an encounter , in fine , delivers me to fill the time , herself most chastely absent after this , to marry her , i add three thousand crowns to what is passed already .
i have yielded instruct my daughter how she shall persever , that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent .
every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs composed to her unworthiness it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves , for he persists as if his life lay o .
why then let us assay our plot , which , if it speed , is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act , where both not sin , and yet a sinful fact but let about it .
exeunt act iv scene i .
without the florentine camp .
enter second french lord , with five or six other soldiers in ambush he can come no other way but by this .
when you sally upon him , speak what terrible language you will though you understand it not yourselves , no matter , for we must not seem to understand him , unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter .
good captain , let me be the interpreter .
art not acquainted with him ?
knows he not thy voice ?
no , sir , i warrant you .
but what hast thou to speak to us again ?
such as you speak to me .
he must think us some band of strangers i ' the adversary entertainment .
now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages , therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy , not to know what we speak one to another , so we seem to know , is to know straight our purpose choughs ' language , gabble enough , and good enough .
as for you , interpreter , you must seem very politic .
but couch , ho !
here he comes , to beguile two hours in a sleep , and then to return and swear the lies he forges .
enter parolles ten within these three hours be time enough to go home .
what shall i say i have done ?
it must be a very plausive invention that carries it they begin to smoke me , and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door .
i find my tongue is too foolhardy , but my heart hath the fear of mars before it and of his creatures , not daring the reports of my tongue .
this is the first truth that thine own tongue was guilty of .
what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum , being not ignorant of the impossibility , and knowing i had no such purpose ?
i must give myself some hurts , and say i got them in exploit yet slight ones will not carry it , they will say , you off with so little ? '
and great ones i dare not give .
wherefore , what the instance ?
tongue , i must put you into a mouth and buy myself another of bajazet mule , if you prattle me into these perils .
is it possible he should know what he is , and be that he is ?
i would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn , or the breaking of my spanish sword .
we can not afford you so .
or the baring of my beard , and to say it was in stratagem .
not do .
or to drown my clothes , and say i was stripped .
hardly serve .
though i swore i leaped from the window of the citadel .
how deep ?
thirty fathom .
three great oaths would scarce make that be believed .
i would i had any drum of the enemy i would swear i recovered it .
you shall hear one anon .

exeunt scene ii .
florence .
the widow house .
enter bertram and diana they told me that your name was fontibell .
no , my good lord , diana .
titled goddess , and worth it , with addition !
but , fair soul , in your fine frame hath love no quality ?
if quick fire of youth light not your mind , you are no maiden , but a monument when you are dead , you should be such a one as you are now , for you are cold and stem , and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got .
she then was honest .
so should you be .
no my mother did but duty , such , my lord , as you owe to your wife .
no more o ' that , i prithee , do not strive against my vows i was compell to her , but i love thee by love own sweet constraint , and will for ever do thee all rights of service .
ay , so you serve us till we serve you , but when you have our roses , you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness .
how have i sworn !
is not the many oaths that makes the truth , but the plain single vow that is vow true .
what is not holy , that we swear not by , but take the to witness then , pray you , tell me , if i should swear by god great attributes , i loved you dearly , would you believe my oaths , when i did love you ill ?
this has no holding , to swear by him whom i protest to love , that i will work against him therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions , but unseal , at least in my opinion .
change it , change it , be not so love is holy , and my integrity knew the crafts that you do charge men with .
stand no more off , but give thyself unto my sick desires , who then recover say thou art mine , and ever my love as it begins shall so persever .
i see that men make ropes in such a scarre that we forsake ourselves .
give me that ring .
i lend it thee , my dear , but have no power to give it from me .
will you not , my lord ?
it is an honour to our house , bequeathed down from many ancestors , which were the greatest obloquy i ' the world in me to lose .
mine honour such a ring my chastity the jewel of our house , bequeathed down from many ancestors , which were the greatest obloquy i ' the world in me to lose thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part , against your vain assault .
here , take my ring my house , mine honour , yea , my life , be thine , and i be bid by thee .
when midnight comes , knock at my i order take my mother shall not hear .
now will i charge you in the band of truth , when you have conquer my yet maiden bed , remain there but an hour , nor speak to me my reasons are most strong , and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliver and on your finger in the night i put another ring , that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds .
adieu , till then , then , fail not .
you have won a wife of me , though there my hope be done .
a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee .
exit for which live long to thank both heaven and me !
you may so in the end .
my mother told me just how he would woo , as if she sat in heart , she says all men have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me when his wife dead , therefore i lie with him when i am buried .
since frenchmen are so braid , marry that will , i live and die a maid only in this disguise i no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win .
exit scene iii .
the florentine camp .
enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers you have not given him his mother letter ?
i have delivered it an hour since there is something i that stings his nature , for on the reading it he changed almost into another man .
he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady .
especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king , who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him .
i will tell you a thing , but you shall let it dwell darkly with you .
when you have spoken it , is dead , and i am the grave of it .
he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence , of a most chaste renown , and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath given her his monumental ring , and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition .
now , god delay our rebellion !
as we are ourselves , what things are we !
merely our own traitors .
and as in the common course of all treasons , we still see them reveal themselves , till they attain to their abhorred ends , so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility , in his proper stream himself .
is it not meant damnable in us , to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents ?
we shall not then have his company ?
not till after midnight , for he is dieted to his hour .
that approaches apace , i would gladly have him see his company anatomized , that he might take a measure of his own judgments , wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit .
we will not meddle with him till he come , for his presence must be the whip of the other .
in the mean time , what hear you of these wars ?
i hear there is an overture of peace .
nay , i assure you , a peace concluded .
what will count rousillon do then ?
will he travel higher , or return again into france ?
i perceive , by this demand , you are not altogether of his council .
let it be forbid , sir , so should i be a great deal of his act .
sir , his wife some two months since fled from his house her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand , which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished , and , there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief , in fine , made a groan of her last breath , and now she sings in heaven .
how is this justified ?
the stronger part of it by her own letters , which makes her story true , even to the point of her death her death itself , which could not be her office to say is come , was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place .
hath the count all this intelligence ?
ay , and the particular confirmations , point from point , so to the full arming of the verity .
i am heartily sorry that he be glad of this .
how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses !
and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears !
the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample .
the web of our life is of a mingled yarn , good and ill together our virtues would be proud , if our faults whipped them not , and our crimes would despair , if they were not cherished by our virtues .
enter a messenger how now !
where your master ?
he met the duke in the street , sir , of whom he hath taken a solemn leave his lordship will next morning for france .
the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king .
they shall be no more than needful there , if they were more than they can commend .
they can not be too sweet for the king tartness .
here his lordship now .
enter bertram how now , my lord !
not after midnight ?
i have dispatched sixteen businesses , a month length , by an abstract of success i have congied with the duke , done my adieu with his nearest , buried a wife , mourned for her , writ to my lady mother i am returning , entertained my convoy , and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs , the last was the greatest , but that i have not ended yet .
if the business be of any difficulty , and this morning your departure hence , it requires haste of your lordship .
i mean , the business is not ended , as fearing to hear of it hereafter .
but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier ?
come , bring forth this counterfeit module , he has deceived me , like a prophesier .
bring him forth has sat i ' the stocks all night , poor gallant knave .
no matter his heels have deserved it , in usurping his spurs so long .
how does he carry himself ?
i have told your lordship already , the stocks carry him .
but to answer you as you would be understood , he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confessed himself to morgan , whom he supposes to be a friar , from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i ' the stocks and what think you he hath confessed ?
nothing of me , has a ' ?
his confession is taken , and it shall be read to his face if your lordship be i , as i believe you are , you must have the patience to hear it .
enter parolles guarded , and first soldier a plague upon him !
muffled !
he can say nothing of me hush , hush !
hoodman comes !
portotartarosa he calls for the tortures what will you say without ?
i will confess what i know without constraint if ye pinch me like a pasty , i can say no more .

you are a merciful general .
our general bids you answer to what i shall ask you out of a note .
and truly , as i hope to live .
reads demand of him how many horse the duke is strong . '
what say you to that ?
five or six thousand , but very weak and unserviceable the troops are all scattered , and the commanders very poor rogues , upon my reputation and credit and as i hope to live .
shall i set down your answer so ?
do i take the sacrament o , how and which way you will .
all one to him .
what a slave is this !
you deceived , my lord this is monsieur parolles , the gallant militarist , that was his own phrase , that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf , and the practise in the chape of his dagger .
i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean .
nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly .
well , that set down .
five or six thousand horse , i said , i will say true , or thereabouts , set down , for i speak truth .
he very near the truth in this .
but i con him no thanks , in the nature he delivers it .
poor rogues , i pray you , say .
well , that set down .
i humbly thank you , sir a truth a truth , the rogues are marvellous poor .
reads of him , of what strength they are . '
what say you to that ?
by my troth , sir , if i were to live this present hour , i will tell true .
let me see spurio , a hundred and fifty , sebastian , so many , corambus , so many , jaques , so many , guiltian , cosmo , lodowick , and gratii , two hundred and fifty each , mine own company , chitopher , vaumond , bentii , two hundred and fifty each so that the , rotten and sound , upon my life , amounts not to fifteen thousand poll , half of the which dare not shake snow from off their cassocks , lest they shake themselves to pieces .
what shall be done to him ?
nothing , but let him have thanks .
demand of him my condition , and what credit i have with the duke .
well , that set down .
reads shall demand of him , whether one captain dumain be i ' the camp , a frenchman , what his reputation is with the duke , what his valour , honesty , and expertness in wars , or whether he thinks it were not possible , with sums of gold , to corrupt him to revolt . '
what say you to this ?
what do you know of it ?
i beseech you , let me answer to the particular of the demand them singly .
do you know this captain dumain ?
i know him a ' was a botcher in paris , from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve fool with child , a dumb innocent , that could not say him nay .
nay , by your leave , hold your hands , though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls .
well , is this captain in the duke of florence camp ?
upon my knowledge , he is , and lousy .
nay look not so upon me , we shall hear of your lordship anon .
what is his reputation with the duke ?
the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine , and writ to me this other day to turn him out o ' the band i think i have his letter in my pocket .
marry , we search .
in good sadness , i do not know , either it is there , or it is upon a file with the duke other letters in my tent .
here is , here a paper shall i read it to you ?
i do not know if it be it or no .
our interpreter does it well .
excellently .
reads , the count a fool , and full of gold , ' that is not the duke letter , sir , that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence , one diana , to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon , a foolish idle boy , but for all that very ruttish i pray you , sir , put it up again .
nay , i read it first , by your favour .
my meaning i , i protest , was very honest in the behalf of the maid , for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy , who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds .
damnable rogue !
reads he swears oaths , bid him drop gold , and take it , after he scores , he never pays the score half won is match well made , match , and well make it , he pays , take it before , and say a soldier , dian , told thee this , men are to mell with , boys are not to kiss for count of this , the count a fool , i know it , who pays before , but not when he does owe it .
thine , as he vowed to thee in thine ear , parolles . '
he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in forehead .
this is your devoted friend , sir , the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier .
i could endure any thing before but a cat , and now he a cat to me .
i perceive , sir , by the general looks , we shall be fain to hang you .
my life , sir , in any case not that i am afraid to die , but that , my offences being many , i would repent out the remainder of nature let me live , sir , in a dungeon , i ' the stocks , or any where , so i may live .
we see what may be done , so you confess freely , therefore , once more to this captain dumain you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour what is his honesty ?
he will steal , sir , an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he professes not keeping of oaths , in breaking he is stronger than hercules he will lie , sir , with such volubility , that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue , for he will be , and in his sleep he does little harm , save to his about him , but they know his conditions and lay him in straw .
i have but little more to say , sir , of his honesty he has every thing that an honest man should not have , what an honest man should have , he has nothing .
i begin to love him for this .
for this description of thine honesty ?
a pox upon him for me , he more and more a cat .
what say you to his expertness in war ?
faith , sir , he has led the drum before the english tragedians , to belie him , i will not , and more of his soldiership i know not , except , in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called , to instruct for the doubling of files i would do the man what honour i can , but of this i am not certain .
he hath villany so far , that the rarity redeems him .
a pox on him , he a cat still .
his qualities being at this poor price , i need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt .
sir , for a quart he will sell the of his salvation , the inheritance of it , and cut the entail from all remainders , and a perpetual succession for it perpetually .
what his brother , the other captain dumain ?
why does be ask him of me ?
what he ?
a crow o ' the same nest , not altogether so great as the first in goodness , but greater a great deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward , yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is in a retreat he outruns any lackey , marry , in coming on he has the cramp .
if your life be saved , will you undertake to betray the florentine ?
ay , and the captain of his horse , count rousillon .
i whisper with the general , and know his pleasure .
aside i no more drumming , a plague of all drums !
only to seem to deserve well , and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count , have i run into this danger .
yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken ?
there is no remedy , sir , but you must die the general says , you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held , can serve the world for no honest use , therefore you must die .
come , headsman , off with his head .
o lord , sir , let me live , or let me see my death !
that shall you , and take your leave of all your friends .
unblinding him so , look about you know you any here ?
good morrow , noble captain .
god bless you , captain parolles .
god save you , noble captain .
captain , what greeting will you to my lord lafeu ?
i am for france .
good captain , will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to diana in behalf of the count rousillon ?
an i were not a very coward , compel it of you but fare you well .
exeunt bertram and lords you are undone , captain , all but your scarf , that has a knot o yet who can not be crushed with a plot ?
if you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame , you might begin an impudent nation .
fare ye well , sir , i am for france too we shall speak of you there .
exit with soldiers yet am i thankful if my heart were great , burst at this .
captain i be no more , but i will eat and drink , and sleep as soft as captain shall simply the thing i am shall make me live .
who knows himself a braggart , let him fear this , for it will come to pass that every braggart shall be found an ass .

i would i had not known him , it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating .
if she had partaken of my flesh , and cost me the dearest groans of a mother , i could not have owed her a more rooted love .
was a good lady , was a good lady we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb .

they are not herbs , you knave , they are .
i am no great nebuchadnezzar , sir , i have not much skill in grass .
whether dost thou profess thyself , a knave or a fool ?
a fool , sir , at a woman service , and a knave at a man .
your distinction ?
i would cozen the man of his wife and do his service .
so you were a knave at his service , indeed .
and i would give his wife my bauble , sir , to do her service .
i will subscribe for thee , thou art both knave and fool .

what prince is that ?
the black prince , sir , alias , the prince of darkness , alias , the devil .
hold thee , there my purse i give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of , serve him still .
i am a woodland fellow , sir , that always loved a great fire , and the master i speak of ever keeps a good fire .
but , sure , he is the prince of the world , let his nobility remain in court .
i am for the house with the narrow gate , which i take to be too little for pomp to enter some that humble themselves may , but the many will be too chill and tender , and they be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire .
go thy ways , i begin to be aweary of thee , and i tell thee so before , because i would not fall out with thee .

how does your ladyship like it ?
with very much content , my lord , and i wish it happily effected .
his highness comes post from marseilles , of as able body as when he numbered thirty he will be here , or i am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed .
it rejoices me , that i hope i shall see him ere i die .
i have letters that my son will be here i shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together .
madam , i was thinking with what manners i might safely be admitted .
you need but plead your honourable privilege .
lady , of that i have made a bold charter , but i thank my god it holds yet .

exit my lord , i am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched .

the count palace .
flourish .
enter king , countess , lafeu , the two french lords , with attendants we lost a jewel of her , and our esteem was made much poorer by it but your son , as mad in folly , lack the sense to know her estimation home .
is past , my liege , and i beseech your majesty to make it natural rebellion , done i ' the blaze of youth , when oil and fire , too strong for reason force , it and burns on .
my honour lady , i have forgiven and forgotten all , though my revenges were high bent upon him , and watch the time to shoot .
this i must say , but first i beg my pardon , the young lord did to his majesty , his mother and his lady offence of mighty note , but to himself the greatest wrong of all .
he lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey of richest eyes , whose words all ears took captive , whose dear perfection hearts that scorn to serve humbly call mistress .
praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear .
well , call him hither , we are reconciled , and the first view shall kill all repetition let him not ask our pardon , the nature of his great offence is dead , and deeper than oblivion we do bury the incensing relics of it let him approach , a stranger , no offender , and inform him so is our will he should .
i shall , my liege .
exit what says he to your daughter ?
have you spoke ?
all that he is hath reference to your highness .
then shall we have a match .
i have letters sent me that set him high in fame .
enter bertram he looks well o .
i am not a day of season , for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way , so stand thou forth , the time is fair again .
my blames , dear sovereign , pardon to me .
all is whole , not one word more of the consumed time .
let take the instant by the forward top , for we are old , and on our decrees the inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them .
you remember the daughter of this lord ?
admiringly , my liege , at first i stuck my choice upon her , ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing , contempt his scornful perspective did lend me , which warp the line of every other favour , scorn a fair colour , or express it stolen , extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself , since i have lost , have loved , was in mine eye the dust that did offend it .
well excused that thou didst love her , strikes some scores away from the great compt but love that comes too late , like a remorseful pardon slowly carried , to the great sender turns a sour offence , crying , good that gone . '
our rash faults make trivial price of serious things we have , not knowing them until we know their grave oft our displeasures , to ourselves unjust , destroy our friends and after weep their dust our own love waking cries to see what done , while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon .
be this sweet helen knell , and now forget her .
send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin the main consents are had , and here we stay to see our widower second .
which better than the first , o dear heaven , bless !
or , ere they meet , in me , o nature , cesse !
come on , my son , in whom my house name must be digested , give a favour from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter , that she may quickly come .
bertram gives a ring by my old beard , and every hair that o , helen , that dead , was a sweet creature such a ring as this , the last that i took her at court , i saw upon her finger .
hers it was not .
now , pray you , let me see it , for mine eye , while i was speaking , oft was fasten .
this ring was mine , and , when i gave it helen , i bade her , if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help , that by this token i would relieve her .
had you that craft , to reave her of what should stead her most ?
my gracious sovereign , it pleases you to take it so , the ring was never hers .
son , on my life , i have seen her wear it , and she reckon it at her life rate .
i am sure i saw her wear it .
you are deceived , my lord , she never saw it in florence was it from a casement thrown me , wrapp in a paper , which contain the name of her that threw it noble she was , and thought i stood engaged but when i had subscribed to mine own fortune and inform her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture , she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again .
plutus himself , that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine , hath not in nature mystery more science than i have in this ring was mine , was helen , whoever gave it you .
then , if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself , confess was hers , and by what rough enforcement you got it from her she call the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger , unless she gave it to yourself in bed , where you have never come , or sent it us upon her great disaster .
she never saw it .
thou it falsely , as i love mine honour , and makest conjectural fears to come into me which i would fain shut out .
if it should prove that thou art so inhuman , not prove so , and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly , and she is dead , which nothing , but to close her eyes myself , could win me to believe , more than to see this ring .
take him away .
guards seize bertram my proofs , the matter fall , shall tax my fears of little vanity , having vainly fear too little .
away with him !
we sift this matter further .
if you shall prove this ring was ever hers , you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence , where yet she never was .
exit , guarded i am wrapp in dismal thinkings .
enter a gentleman gracious sovereign , whether i have been to blame or no , i know not here a petition from a florentine , who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself .
i undertook it , vanquish thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant , who by this i know is here attending her business looks in her with an importing visage , and she told me , in a sweet verbal brief , it did concern your highness with herself .
reads upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead , i blush to say it , he won me .
now is the count rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me , and my honour paid to him .
he stole from florence , taking no leave , and i follow him to his country for justice grant it me , o king !
in you it best lies , otherwise a seducer flourishes , and a poor maid is undone .
diana capilet .
i will buy me a in a fair , and toll for this i none of him .
the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu , to bring forth this discovery .
seek these suitors go speedily and bring again the count .
i am afeard the life of helen , lady , was foully snatch .
now , justice on the doers !
bertram , guarded i wonder , sir , sith wives are monsters to you , and that you fly them as you swear them lordship , yet you desire to marry .
enter widow and diana what woman that ?
i am , my lord , a wretched florentine , derived from the ancient capilet my suit , as i do understand , you know , and therefore know how far i may be pitied .
i am her mother , sir , whose age and honour both suffer under this complaint we bring , and both shall cease , without your remedy .
come hither , count , do you know these women ?
my lord , i neither can nor will deny but that i know them do they charge me further ?
why do you look so strange upon your wife ?
she none of mine , my lord .
if you shall marry , you give away this hand , and that is mine , you give away heaven vows , and those are mine , you give away myself , which is known mine , for i by vow am so embodied yours , that she which marries you must marry me , either both or none .
your reputation comes too short for my daughter , you are no husband for her .
my lord , this is a fond and desperate creature , whom sometime i have laugh with let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here .
sir , for my thoughts , you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies .
good my lord , ask him upon his oath , if he does think he had not my virginity .
what thou to her ?
she impudent , my lord , and was a common gamester to the camp .
he does me wrong , my lord , if i were so , he might have bought me at a common price do not believe him .
o , behold this ring , whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel , yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o ' the camp , if i be one .
he blushes , and is it of six preceding ancestors , that gem , conferr by testament to the sequent issue , hath it been owed and worn .
this is his wife , that ring a thousand proofs .
methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it .
i did , my lord , but loath am to produce so bad an instrument his name parolles .
i saw the man , if man he be .
find him , and bring him hither .
exit an attendant what of him ?
he quoted for a most perfidious slave , with all the spots o ' the world tax and debosh , whose nature sickens but to speak a truth .
am i or that or this for what he utter , that will speak any thing ?
she hath that ring of yours .
i think she has certain it is i liked her , and boarded her i ' the wanton way of youth she knew her distance and did angle for me , madding my eagerness with her restraint , as all impediments in fancy course are motives of more fancy , and , in fine , her infinite cunning , with her modern grace , subdued me to her rate she got the ring , and i had that which any inferior might at have bought .
i must be patient you , that have turn off a first so noble wife , may justly diet me .
i pray you yet , since you lack virtue , i will lose a husband , send for your ring , i will return it home , and give me mine again .
i have it not .
what ring was yours , i pray you ?
sir , much like the same upon your finger .
know you this ring ?
this ring was his of late .
and this was it i gave him , being abed .
the story then goes false , you threw it him out of a casement .
i have spoke the truth .
enter parolles my lord , i do confess the ring was hers .
you boggle shrewdly , every feather stars you .
is this the man you speak of ?
ay , my lord .
tell me , sirrah , but tell me true , i charge you , not fearing the displeasure of your master , which on your just proceeding i keep off , by him and by this woman here what know you ?
so please your majesty , my master hath been an honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him , which gentlemen have .
come , come , to the purpose did he love this woman ?
faith , sir , he did love her , but how ?
how , i pray you ?
he did love her , sir , as a gentleman loves a woman .
how is that ?
he loved her , sir , and loved her not .
as thou art a knave , and no knave .
what an equivocal companion is this !
i am a poor man , and at your majesty command .
he a good drum , my lord , but a naughty orator .
do you know he promised me marriage ?
faith , i know more than i speak .
but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest ?
yes , so please your majesty .
i did go between them , as i said , but more than that , he loved her for indeed he was mad for her , and talked of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know not what yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i knew of their going to bed , and of other motions , as promising her marriage , and things which would derive me ill will to speak of , therefore i will not speak what i know .
thou hast spoken all already , unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too fine in thy evidence , therefore stand aside .
this ring , you say , was yours ?
ay , my good lord .
where did you buy it ?
or who gave it you ?
it was not given me , nor i did not buy it .
who lent it you ?
it was not lent me neither .
where did you find it , then ?
i found it not .
if it were yours by none of all these ways , how could you give it him ?
i never gave it him .
this woman an easy glove , my lord , she goes off and on at pleasure .
this ring was mine , i gave it his first wife .
it might be yours or hers , for aught i know .
take her away , i do not like her now , to prison with her and away with him .
unless thou me where thou hadst this ring , thou diest within this hour .
i never tell you .
take her away .
i put in bail , my liege .
i think thee now some common customer .
by jove , if ever i knew man , was you .
wherefore hast thou accused him all this while ?
because he guilty , and he is not guilty he knows i am no maid , and he swear , i swear i am a maid , and he knows not .
great king , i am no strumpet , by my life , i am either maid , or else this old man wife .
she does abuse our ears to prison with her .
good mother , fetch my bail .
stay , royal sir exit widow the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for , and he shall surety me .
but for this lord , who hath abused me , as he knows himself , though yet he never harm me , here i quit him he knows himself my bed he hath defiled , and at that time he got his wife with child dead though she be , she feels her young one kick so there my riddle one that dead is quick and now behold the meaning .
widow , with helena is there no exorcist beguiles the truer office of mine eyes ?
real that i see ?
no , my good lord , is but the shadow of a wife you see , the name and not the thing .
both , both .
o , pardon !
o my good lord , when i was like this maid , i found you wondrous kind .
there is your ring , and , look you , here your letter , this it says from my finger you can get this ring and are by me with child , ' and this is done will you be mine , now you are doubly won ?
if she , my liege , can make me know this clearly , i love her dearly , ever , ever dearly .
if it appear not plain and prove untrue , deadly divorce step between me and you !

exeunt act i scene orchard of oliver house .
enter orlando and adam as i remember , adam , it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns , and , as thou sayest , charged my brother , on his blessing , to breed me well and there begins my sadness .
my brother jaques he keeps at school , and report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part , he keeps me rustically at home , or , to speak more properly , stays me here at home unkept , for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth , that differs not from the stalling of an ox ?
his horses are bred better , for , besides that they are fair with their feeding , they are taught their manage , and to that end riders dearly hired but i , his brother , gain nothing under him but growth , for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i .
besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me , the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me he lets me feed with his hinds , bars me the place of a brother , and , as much as in him lies , mines my gentility with my education .
this is it , adam , that grieves me , and the spirit of my father , which i think is within me , begins to mutiny against this servitude i will no longer endure it , though yet i know no wise remedy how to avoid it .
yonder comes my master , your brother .
go apart , adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .
enter oliver now , sir !
what make you here ?
nothing i am not taught to make any thing .
what mar you then , sir ?
marry , sir , i am helping you to mar that which god made , a poor unworthy brother of yours , with idleness .
marry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .
shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?
what prodigal portion have i spent , that i should come to such penury ?
know you where your are , sir ?
o , sir , very well , here in your orchard .
know you before whom , sir ?
ay , better than him i am before knows me .
i know you are my eldest brother , and , in the gentle condition of blood , you should so know me .
the courtesy of nations allows you my better , in that you are the , but the same tradition takes not away my blood , were there twenty brothers betwixt us i have as much of my father in me as you , albeit , i confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .
what , boy !
come , come , elder brother , you are too young in this .
wilt thou lay hands on me , villain ?
i am no villain , i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys , he was my father , and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains .
wert thou not my brother , i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself .
sweet masters , be patient for your father remembrance , be at accord .
let me go , i say .
i will not , till i please you shall hear me .
my father charged you in his will to give me good education you have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all qualities .
the spirit of my father grows strong in me , and i will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman , or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament , with that i will go buy my fortunes .
and what wilt thou do ?
beg , when that is spent ?
well , sir , get you in i will not long be troubled with you , you shall have some part of your will i pray you , leave me .
i will no further offend you than becomes me for my good .
get you with him , you old dog .
is dog ' my reward ?
most true , i have lost my teeth in your service .
god be with my old master !
he would not have spoke such a word .
exeunt orlando and adam is it even so ?
begin you to grow upon me ?
i will physic your rankness , and yet give no thousand crowns neither .
holla , dennis !
enter dennis calls your worship ?
was not charles , the duke wrestler , here to speak with me ?
so please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
call him in .
exit dennis be a good way , and the wrestling is .
enter charles good morrow to your worship .
good monsieur charles , what the new news at the new court ?
there no news at the court , sir , but the old news that is , the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke , and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him , whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke , therefore he gives them good leave to wander .
can you tell if rosalind , the duke daughter , be banished with her father ?
o , no , for the duke daughter , her cousin , so loves her , being ever from their cradles bred together , that she would have followed her exile , or have died to stay behind her .
she is at the court , and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter , and never two ladies loved as they do .
where will the old duke live ?
they say he is already in the forest of arden , and a many merry men with him , and there they live like the old robin hood of england they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day , and fleet the time carelessly , as they did in the golden world .
what , you wrestle before the new duke ?
marry , do i , sir , and i came to acquaint you with a matter .
i am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall .
, sir , i wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well .
your brother is but young and tender , and , for your love , i would be loath to foil him , as i must , for my own honour , if he come in therefore , out of my love to you , i came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
charles , i thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite .
i had myself notice of my brother purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it , but he is resolute .
i tell thee , charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of france , full of ambition , an envious emulator of every man good parts , a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother therefore use thy discretion , i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger .
and thou wert best look , for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee , he will practise against thee by poison , entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath thy life by some indirect means or other , for , i assure thee , and almost with tears i speak it , there is not one so young and so villanous this day living .
i speak but brotherly of him , but should i anatomize him to thee as he is , i must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder .
i am heartily glad i came hither to you .
if he come , i give him his payment if ever he go alone again , i never wrestle for prize more and so god keep your worship !
farewell , good charles .
exit charles now will i stir this gamester i hope i shall see an end of him , for my soul , yet i know not why , hates nothing more than he .
yet he gentle , never schooled and yet learned , full of noble device , of all sorts enchantingly beloved , and indeed so much in the heart of the world , and especially of my own people , who best know him , that i am altogether misprised but it shall not be so long , this wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither , which now i go about .
exit scene ii .
lawn before the duke palace .
enter celia and rosalind i pray thee , rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .
dear celia , i show more mirth than i am mistress of , and would you yet i were merrier ?
unless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .
herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight that i love thee .
if my uncle , thy banished father , had banished thy uncle , the duke my father , so thou hadst been still with me , i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou , if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee .
well , i will forget the condition of my estate , to rejoice in yours .
you know my father hath no child but i , nor none is like to have and , truly , when he dies , thou shalt be his heir , for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce , i will render thee again in affection , by mine honour , i will , and when i break that oath , let me turn monster therefore , my sweet rose , my dear rose , be merry .
from henceforth i will , coz , and devise sports .
let me see , what think you of falling in love ?
marry , i prithee , do , to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest , nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again .
what shall be our sport , then ?
let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .
i would we could do so , for her benefits are mightily misplaced , and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women .
is true , for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest , and those that she makes honest she makes very .
nay , now thou goest from fortune office to nature fortune reigns in gifts of the world , not in the lineaments of nature .
enter touchstone no ?
when nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by fortune fall into the fire ?
though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune , hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?
indeed , there is fortune too hard for nature , when fortune makes nature natural the of nature wit .
peradventure this is not fortune work neither , but nature , who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone , for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits .
how now , wit !
whither wander you ?
mistress , you must come away to your father .
were you made the messenger ?
no , by mine honour , but i was bid to come for you .
where learned you that oath , fool ?
of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught now i stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .
how prove you that , in the great heap of your knowledge ?
ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
stand you both forth now stroke your chins , and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
by our beards , if we had them , thou art .
by my knavery , if i had it , then i were , but if you swear by that that is not , you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honour , for he never had any , or if he had , he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard .
prithee , who that thou meanest ?
one that old frederick , your father , loves .
my father love is enough to honour him enough !
speak no more of him , you be whipped for taxation one of these days .
the more pity , that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
by my troth , thou sayest true , for since the little wit that fools have was silenced , the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show .
here comes monsieur le beau .
with his mouth full of news .
which he will put on us , as pigeons feed their young .
then shall we be .
all the better , we shall be the more marketable .
enter le beau bon jour , monsieur le beau what the news ?
fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
sport !
of what colour ?
what colour , madam !
how shall i answer you ?
as wit and fortune will .
or as the destinies decree .
well said that was laid on with a trowel .
nay , if i keep not my rank , thou losest thy old smell .
you amaze me , ladies i would have told you of good wrestling , which you have lost the sight of .
you tell us the manner of the wrestling .
i will tell you the beginning , and , if it please your ladyships , you may see the end , for the best is yet to do , and here , where you are , they are coming to perform it .
well , the beginning , that is dead and buried .
there comes an old man and his three sons , i could match this beginning with an old tale .
three proper young men , of excellent growth and presence .
with bills on their necks , it known unto all men by these presents . '
the eldest of the three wrestled with charles , the duke wrestler , which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him so he served the second , and so the third .
yonder they lie , the poor old man , their father , making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .
alas !
but what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost ?
why , this that i speak of .
thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies .
or i , i promise thee .
but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?
is there yet another dotes upon ?
shall we see this wrestling , cousin ?
you must , if you stay here , for here is the place appointed for the wrestling , and they are ready to perform it .
yonder , sure , they are coming let us now stay and see it .
flourish .
enter duke frederick , lords , orlando , charles , and attendants come on since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
is yonder the man ?
even he , madam .
alas , he is too young !
yet he looks successfully .
how now , daughter and cousin !
are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
you will take little delight in it , i can tell you , there is such odds in the man .
in pity of the challenger youth i would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated .
speak to him , ladies , see if you can move him .
call him hither , good monsieur le beau .
do so i not be by .
monsieur the challenger , the princesses call for you .
i attend them with all respect and duty .
young man , have you challenged charles the wrestler ?
no , fair princess , he is the general challenger i come but in , as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .
young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years .
you have seen cruel proof of this man strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise .
we pray you , for your own sake , to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
do , young sir , your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward .
i beseech you , punish me not with your hard thoughts , wherein i confess me much guilty , to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing .
but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if i be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious , if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so i shall do my friends no wrong , for i have none to lament me , the world no injury , for in it i have nothing , only in the world i fill up a place , which may be better supplied when i have made it empty .
the little strength that i have , i would it were with you .
and mine , to eke out hers .
fare you well pray heaven i be deceived in you !
your heart desires be with you !
come , where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth ?
ready , sir , but his will hath in it a more modest working .
you shall try but one fall .
no , i warrant your grace , you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
an you mean to mock me after , you should not have mocked me before but come your ways .
now hercules be thy speed , young man !
i would i were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
they wrestle o excellent young man !
if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye , i can tell who should down .
shout .
charles is thrown no more , no more .
yes , i beseech your grace i am not yet well breathed .
how dost thou , charles ?
he can not speak , my lord .
bear him away .
what is thy name , young man ?
orlando , my liege , the youngest son of sir rowland de boys .
i would thou hadst been son to some man else the world esteem thy father honourable , but i did find him still mine enemy thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed , hadst thou descended from another house .
but fare thee well , thou art a gallant youth i would thou hadst told me of another father .
exeunt duke frederick , train , and le beau were i my father , coz , would i do this ?
i am more proud to be sir rowland son , his youngest son , and would not change that calling , to be adopted heir to frederick .
my father loved sir rowland as his soul , and all the world was of my father mind had i before known this young man his son , i should have given him tears unto entreaties , ere he should thus have ventured .
gentle cousin , let us go thank him and encourage him my father rough and envious disposition sticks me at heart .
sir , you have well deserved if you do keep your promises in love but justly , as you have exceeded all promise , your mistress shall be happy .
gentleman , giving him a chain from her neck wear this for me , one out of suits with fortune , that could give more , but that her hand lacks means .
shall we go , coz ?
ay .
fare you well , fair gentleman .
can i not say , i thank you ?
my better parts are all thrown down , and that which here stands up is but a quintain , a mere lifeless block .
he calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes , i ask him what he would .
did you call , sir ?
sir , you have wrestled well and overthrown more than your enemies .
will you go , coz ?
have with you .
fare you well .
exeunt rosalind and celia what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?
i can not speak to her , yet she urged conference .
o poor orlando , thou art overthrown !
or charles or something weaker masters thee .
le beau good sir , i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place .
albeit you have deserved high commendation , true applause and love , yet such is now the duke condition that he misconstrues all that you have done .
the duke is humorous , what he is indeed , more suits you to conceive than i to speak of .
i thank you , sir and , pray you , tell me this which of the two was daughter of the duke that here was at the wrestling ?
neither his daughter , if we judge by manners , but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter the other is daughter to the banish duke , and here detain by her usurping uncle , to keep his daughter company , whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters .
but i can tell you that of late this duke hath displeasure his gentle niece , grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good father sake , and , on my life , his malice the lady will suddenly break forth .
sir , fare you well hereafter , in a better world than this , i shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
i rest much bounden to you fare you well .
exit le beau thus must i from the smoke into the smother , from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother but heavenly rosalind !
exit scene iii .
a room in the palace .
enter celia and rosalind why , cousin !
why , rosalind !
cupid have mercy !
not a word ?
not one to throw at a dog .
no , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs , throw some of them at me , come , lame me with reasons .
then there were two cousins laid up , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .
but is all this for your father ?
no , some of it is for my child father .
o , how full of briers is this world !
they are but burs , cousin , thrown upon thee in holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
i could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart .
hem them away .
i would try , if i could cry ' and have him .
come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
o , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself !
o , a good wish upon you !
you will try in time , in despite of a fall .
but , turning these jests out of service , let us talk in good earnest is it possible , on such a sudden , you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowland youngest son ?
the duke my father loved his father dearly .
doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ?
by this kind of chase , i should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly , yet i hate not orlando .
no , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
why should i not ?
doth he not deserve well ?
let me love him for that , and do you love him because i do .
look , here comes the duke .
with his eyes full of anger .
enter duke frederick , with lords mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste and get you from our court .
me , uncle ?
you , cousin within these ten days if that thou found so near our public court as twenty miles , thou diest for it .
i do beseech your grace , let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me if with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires , if that i do not dream or be not frantic , as i do trust i am not then , dear uncle , never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness .
thus do all traitors if their purgation did consist in words , they are as innocent as grace itself let it suffice thee that i trust thee not .
yet your mistrust can not make me a traitor tell me whereon the likelihood depends .
thou art thy father daughter , there enough .
so was i when your highness took his dukedom , so was i when your highness banish him treason is not inherited , my lord , or , if we did derive it from our friends , what that to me ?
my father was no traitor then , good my liege , mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous .
dear sovereign , hear me speak .
ay , celia , we stay her for your sake , else had she with her father ranged along .
i did not then entreat to have her stay , it was your pleasure and your own remorse i was too young that time to value her , but now i know her if she be a traitor , why so am i , we still have slept together , rose at an instant , learn , play , eat together , and wheresoever we went , like juno swans , still we went coupled and inseparable .
she is too subtle for thee , and her smoothness , her very silence and her patience speak to the people , and they pity her .
thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name , and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone .
then open not thy lips firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have pass upon her , she is banish .
pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege i can not live out of her company .
you are a fool .
you , niece , provide yourself if you outstay the time , upon mine honour , and in the greatness of my word , you die .
exeunt duke frederick and lords o my poor rosalind , whither wilt thou go ?
wilt thou change fathers ?
i will give thee mine .
i charge thee , be not thou more grieved than i am .
i have more cause .
thou hast not , cousin , prithee be cheerful thou not , the duke hath banish me , his daughter ?
that he hath not .
no , hath not ?
rosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one shall we be sunder ?
shall we part , sweet girl ?
no let my father seek another heir .
therefore devise with me how we may fly , whither to go and what to bear with us , and do not seek to take your change upon you , to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out , for , by this heaven , now at our sorrows pale , say what thou canst , i go along with thee .
why , whither shall we go ?
to seek my uncle in the forest of arden .
alas , what danger will it be to us , maids as we are , to travel forth so far !
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
i put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face , the like do you so shall we pass along and never stir assailants .
were it not better , because that i am more than common tall , that i did suit me all points like a man ?
a gallant upon my thigh , a in my hand , and in my heart lie there what hidden woman fear there will we have a swashing and a martial outside , as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances .
what shall i call thee when thou art a man ?
i have no worse a name than jove own page , and therefore look you call me ganymede .
but what will you be call ?
something that hath a reference to my state no longer celia , but aliena .
but , cousin , what if we assay to steal the clownish fool out of your father court ?
would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
he go along the wide world with me , leave me alone to woo him .
let away , and get our jewels and our wealth together , devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight .
now go we in content to liberty and not to banishment .
exeunt act ii scene i .
the forest of arden .
enter duke senior , amiens , and two or three lords , like foresters now , my and brothers in exile , hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp ?
are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court ?
here feel we but the penalty of adam , the seasons ' difference , as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter wind , which , when it bites and blows upon my body , even till i shrink with cold , i smile and say is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am . '
sweet are the uses of adversity , which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , wears yet a precious jewel in his head , and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , sermons in stones and good in every thing .
i would not change it .
happy is your grace , that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style .
come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools , being native burghers of this desert city , should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gored .
indeed , my lord , the melancholy jaques grieves at that , and , in that kind , swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banish you .
my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequester stag , that from the hunter aim had a hurt , did come to languish , and indeed , my lord , the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting , and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase , and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques , stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook , augmenting it with tears .
but what said jaques ?
did he not moralize this spectacle ?
o , yes , into a thousand similes .
first , for his weeping into the needless stream , deer , ' quoth he , makest a testament as worldlings do , giving thy sum of more to that which had too much ' then , being there alone , left and abandon of his velvet friends , right ' quoth he , misery doth part the flux of company ' anon a careless herd , full of the pasture , jumps along by him and never stays to greet him , ' quoth jaques , on , you fat and greasy citizens , is just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there ? '
thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country , city , court , yea , and of this our life , swearing that we are mere usurpers , tyrants and what worse , to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assign and native .
and did you leave him in this contemplation ?
we did , my lord , weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer .
show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits , for then he full of matter .
i bring you to him straight .
exeunt scene ii .
a room in the palace .
enter duke frederick , with lords can it be possible that no man saw them ?
it can not be some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this .
i can not hear of any that did see her .
the ladies , her attendants of her chamber , saw her abed , and in the morning early they found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
my lord , the roynish clown , at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh , is also missing .
hisperia , the princess ' gentlewoman , confesses that she secretly your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles , and she believes , wherever they are gone , that youth is surely in their company .
send to his brother , fetch that gallant hither , if he be absent , bring his brother to me , i make him find him do this suddenly , and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways .
exeunt scene iii .
before oliver house .
enter orlando and adam , meeting who there ?
what , my young master ?
o , my gentle master !
o my sweet master !
o you memory of old sir rowland !
why , what make you here ?
why are you virtuous ?
why do people love you ?
and wherefore are you gentle , strong and valiant ?
why would you be so fond to overcome the bonny priser of the humorous duke ?
your praise is come too swiftly home before you .
know you not , master , to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies ?
no more do yours your virtues , gentle master , are sanctified and holy traitors to you .
o , what a world is this , when what is comely envenoms him that bears it !
why , what the matter ?
o unhappy youth !
come not within these doors , within this roof the enemy of all your graces lives your brother no , no brother , yet the son yet not the son , i will not call him son of him i was about to call his father hath heard your praises , and this night he means to burn the lodging where you use to lie and you within it if he fail of that , he will have other means to cut you off .
i overheard him and his practises .
this is no place , this house is but a butchery abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
why , whither , adam , wouldst thou have me go ?
no matter whither , so you come not here .
what , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food ?
or with a base and boisterous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road ?
this i must do , or know not what to do yet this i will not do , do how i can , i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother .
but do not so .
i have five hundred crowns , the thrifty hire i saved under your father , which i did store to be my when service should in my old limbs lie lame and unregarded age in corners thrown take that , and he that doth the ravens feed , yea , providently caters for the sparrow , be comfort to my age !
here is the gold , and all this i give you .
let me be your servant though i look old , yet i am strong and lusty , for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood , nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility , therefore my age is as a lusty winter , frosty , but kindly let me go with you , i do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities .
o good old man , how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world , when service sweat for duty , not for meed !
thou art not for the fashion of these times , where none will sweat but for promotion , and having that , do choke their service up even with the having it is not so with thee .
but , poor old man , thou prunest a rotten tree , that can not so much as a blossom yield in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry but come thy ways , well go along together , and ere we have thy youthful wages spent , we light upon some settled low content .
master , go on , and i will follow thee , to the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore here lived i , but now live here no more .
at seventeen years many their fortunes seek , but at fourscore it is too late a week yet fortune can not recompense me better than to die well and not my master debtor .
exeunt scene iv .
the forest of arden .
enter rosalind for ganymede , celia for aliena , and touchstone o jupiter , how weary are my spirits !
i care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
i could find in my heart to disgrace my man apparel and to cry like a woman , but i must comfort the weaker vessel , as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage , good aliena !
i pray you , bear with me , i can not go no further .
for my part , i had rather bear with you than bear you , yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you , for i think you have no money in your purse .
well , this is the forest of arden .
ay , now am i in arden , the more fool i , when i was at home , i was in a better place but travellers must be content .
ay , be so , good touchstone .
enter corin and silvius look you , who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
that is the way to make her scorn you still .
o corin , that thou how i do love her !
i partly guess , for i have loved ere now .
no , corin , being old , thou canst not guess , though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sigh upon a midnight pillow but if thy love were ever like to mine as sure i think did never man love so how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?
into a thousand that i have forgotten .
o , thou didst then love so heartily !
if thou not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into , thou hast not loved or if thou hast not sat as i do now , wearying thy hearer in thy mistress ' praise , thou hast not loved or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly , as my passion now makes me , thou hast not loved .
o phebe , phebe , phebe !
exit alas , poor shepherd !
searching of thy wound , i have by hard adventure found mine own .
and i mine .
i remember , when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming to jane smile , and i remember the kissing of her batlet and the cow dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milked , and i remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom i took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears these for my sake . '
we that are true lovers run into strange capers , but as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of .
nay , i shall be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it .
jove , jove !
this shepherd passion is much upon my fashion .
and mine , but it grows something stale with me .
i pray you , one of you question yond man if he for gold will give us any food i faint almost to death .
holla , you clown !
peace , fool he not thy kinsman .
who calls ?
your betters , sir .
else are they very wretched .
peace , i say .
good even to you , friend .
and to you , gentle sir , and to you all .
i prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment , bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed here a young maid with travel much oppress and faints for succor .
fair sir , i pity her and wish , for her sake more than for mine own , my fortunes were more able to relieve her , but i am shepherd to another man and do not shear the fleeces that i graze my master is of churlish disposition and little recks to find the way to heaven by doing deeds of hospitality besides , his cote , his flocks and bounds of feed are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , by reason of his absence , there is nothing that you will feed on , but what is , come see .
and in my voice most welcome shall you be .
what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?
that young swain that you saw here but erewhile , that little cares for buying any thing .
i pray thee , if it stand with honesty , buy thou the cottage , pasture and the flock , and thou shalt have to pay for it of us .
and we will mend thy wages .
i like this place .
and willingly could waste my time in it .
assuredly the thing is to be sold go with me if you like upon report the soil , the profit and this kind of life , i will your very faithful feeder be and buy it with your gold right suddenly .
exeunt scene the forest .
enter amiens , jaques , and others song .
under the greenwood tree who loves to lie with me , and turn his merry note unto the sweet bird throat , come hither , come hither , come hither here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather .
more , more , i prithee , more .
it will make you melancholy , monsieur jaques .
i thank it .
more , i prithee , more .
i can suck melancholy out of a song , as a weasel sucks eggs .
more , i prithee , more .
my voice is ragged i know i can not please you .
i do not desire you to please me , i do desire you to sing .
come , more , another stanzo call you stanzos ?
what you will , monsieur jaques .
nay , i care not for their names , they owe me nothing .
will you sing ?
more at your request than to please myself .
well then , if ever i thank any man , i thank you , but that they call compliment is like the encounter of two , and when a man thanks me heartily , methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks .
come , sing , and you that will not , hold your tongues .
well , i end the song .
sirs , cover the while , the duke will drink under this tree .
he hath been all this day to look you .
and i have been all this day to avoid him .
he is too disputable for my company i think of as many matters as he , but i give heaven thanks and make no boast of them .
come , warble , come .
song .
who doth ambition shun all together here and loves to live i ' the sun , seeking the food he eats and pleased with what he gets , come hither , come hither , come hither here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather .
i give you a verse to this note that i made yesterday in despite of my invention .
and i sing it .
thus it goes if it do come to pass that any man turn ass , leaving his wealth and ease , a stubborn will to please , ducdame , ducdame , ducdame here shall he see gross fools as he , an if he will come to me .
what that ' ?
is a greek invocation , to call fools into a circle .
i go sleep , if i can , if i can not , i rail against all the of egypt .
and i go seek the duke his banquet is prepared .
exeunt severally scene vi .
the forest .
enter orlando and adam dear master , i can go no further .
o , i die for food !
here lie i down , and measure out my grave .
farewell , kind master .
why , how now , adam !
no greater heart in thee ?
live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .
if this uncouth forest yield any thing savage , i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .
thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers .
for my sake be comfortable , hold death awhile at the arm end i will here be with thee presently , and if i bring thee not something to eat , i will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before i come , thou art a mocker of my labour .
well said !
thou lookest cheerly , and i be with thee quickly .
yet thou liest in the bleak air come , i will bear thee to some shelter , and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner , if there live any thing in this desert .
cheerly , good adam !
exeunt scene vii .
the forest .
a table set out .
enter duke senior , amiens , and lords like outlaws i think he be transform into a beast , for i can no where find him like a man .
my lord , he is but even now gone hence here was he merry , hearing of a song .
if he , compact of jars , grow musical , we shall have shortly discord in the spheres .
go , seek him tell him i would speak with him .
enter jaques he saves my labour by his own approach .
why , how now , monsieur !
what a life is this , that your poor friends must woo your company ?
what , you look merrily !
a fool , a fool !
i met a fool i ' the forest , a motley fool , a miserable world !
as i do live by food , i met a fool who laid him down and bask him in the sun , and rail on lady fortune in good terms , in good set terms and yet a motley fool .
morrow , fool , ' quoth i .
, sir , ' quoth he , me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune ' and then he drew a dial from his poke , and , looking on it with eye , says very wisely , is ten thus we may see , ' quoth he , the world wags is but an hour ago since it was nine , and after one hour more be eleven , and so , from hour to hour , we ripe and ripe , and then , from hour to hour , we rot and rot , and thereby hangs a tale . '
when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time , my lungs began to crow like chanticleer , that fools should be so , and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial .
o noble fool !
a worthy fool !
motley the only wear .
what fool is this ?
o worthy fool !
one that hath been a courtier , and says , if ladies be but young and fair , they have the gift to know it and in his brain , which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage , he hath strange places cramm with observation , the which he vents in mangled forms .
o that i were a fool !
i am ambitious for a motley coat .
thou shalt have one .
it is my only suit , provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise .
i must have liberty withal , as large a charter as the wind , to blow on whom i please , for so fools have , and they that are most galled with my folly , they most must laugh .
and why , sir , must they so ?
the ' is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly , although he smart , not to seem senseless of the bob if not , the wise man folly is anatomized even by the squandering glances of the fool .
invest me in my motley , give me leave to speak my mind , and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of the infected world , if they will patiently receive my medicine .
fie on thee !
i can tell what thou wouldst do .
what , for a counter , would i do but good ?
most mischievous foul sin , in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine , as sensual as the brutish sting itself , and all the embossed sores and headed evils , that thou with licence of free foot hast caught , wouldst thou disgorge into the general world .
why , who cries out on pride , that can therein tax any private party ?
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea , till that the weary very means do ebb ?
what woman in the city do i name , when that i say the bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders ?
who can come in and say that i mean her , when such a one as she such is her neighbour ?
or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not of my cost , thinking that i mean him , but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech ?
there then , how then ?
what then ?
let me see wherein my tongue hath wrong him if it do him right , then he hath wrong himself , if he be free , why then my taxing like a flies , unclaim of any man .
but who comes here ?
enter orlando , with his sword drawn forbear , and eat no more .
why , i have eat none yet .
nor shalt not , till necessity be served .
of what kind should this cock come of ?
art thou thus bolden , man , by thy distress , or else a rude despiser of good manners , that in civility thou so empty ?
you touch my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath from me the show of smooth civility yet am i inland bred and know some nurture .
but forbear , i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered .
an you will not be answered with reason , i must die .
what would you have ?
your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness .
i almost die for food , and let me have it .
sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
speak you so gently ?
pardon me , i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here , and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment .
but you are that in this desert inaccessible , under the shade of melancholy boughs , lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have look on better days , if ever been where bells have knoll to church , if ever sat at any good man feast , if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear and know what is to pity and be pitied , let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush , and hide my sword .
true is it that we have seen better days , and have with holy bell been knoll to church and sat at good men feasts and wiped our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engender and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be minister .
then but forbear your food a little while , whiles , like a doe , i go to find my fawn and give it food .
there is an old poor man , who after me hath many a weary step limp in pure love till he be first sufficed , oppress with two weak evils , age and hunger , i will not touch a bit .
go find him out , and we will nothing waste till you return .
i thank ye , and be blest for your good comfort !
exit thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in .
all the world a stage , and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances , and one man in his time plays many parts , his acts being seven ages .
at first the infant , mewling and puking in the nurse arms .
and then the whining , with his satchel and shining morning face , creeping like snail unwillingly to school .
and then the lover , sighing like furnace , with a woeful ballad made to his mistress ' eyebrow .
then a soldier , full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard , jealous in honour , sudden and quick in quarrel , seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon mouth .
and then the justice , in fair round belly with good capon lined , with eyes severe and beard of formal cut , full of wise saws and modern instances , and so he plays his part .
the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper pantaloon , with spectacles on nose and pouch on side , his youthful hose , well saved , a world too wide for his shrunk shank , and his big manly voice , turning again toward childish treble , pipes and whistles in his sound .
last scene of all , that ends this strange eventful history , is second childishness and mere oblivion , sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything .
orlando , with adam welcome .
set down your venerable burthen , and let him feed .
i thank you most for him .
so had you need i scarce can speak to thank you for myself .
welcome , fall to i will not trouble you as yet , to question you about your fortunes .
give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .
song .
blow , blow , thou winter wind .
thou art not so unkind as man ingratitude , thy tooth is not so keen , because thou art not seen , although thy breath be rude .
!
sing , !
unto the green holly most friendship is feigning , most loving mere folly then , , the holly !
this life is most jolly .
freeze , freeze , thou bitter sky , that dost not bite so nigh as benefits forgot though thou the waters warp , thy sting is not so sharp as friend remember not .
!
sing , and if that you were the good sir rowland son , as you have whisper faithfully you were , and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limn and living in your face , be truly welcome hither i am the duke that loved your father the residue of your fortune , go to my cave and tell me .
good old man , thou art right welcome as thy master is .
support him by the arm .
give me your hand , and let me all your fortunes understand .
exeunt act iii scene i .
a room in the palace .
enter duke frederick , lords , and oliver not see him since ?
sir , sir , that can not be but were i not the better part made mercy , i should not seek an absent argument of my revenge , thou present .
but look to it find out thy brother , he is , seek him with candle , bring him dead or living within this twelvemonth , or turn thou no more to seek a living in our territory .
thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine worth seizure do we seize into our hands , till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth of what we think against thee .
o that your highness knew my heart in this !
i never loved my brother in my life .
more villain thou .
well , push him out of doors , and let my officers of such a nature make an extent upon his house and lands do this expediently and turn him going .
exeunt scene ii .
the forest .
enter orlando , with a paper hang there , my verse , in witness of my love and thou , queen of night , survey with thy chaste eye , from thy pale sphere above , thy huntress ' name that my full life doth sway .
o rosalind !
these trees shall be my books and in their barks my thoughts i character , that every eye which in this forest looks shall see thy virtue witness every where .
run , run , orlando , carve on every tree the fair , the chaste and unexpressive she .
exit enter corin and touchstone and how like you this shepherd life , master touchstone ?
truly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life , but in respect that it is a shepherd life , it is naught .
in respect that it is solitary , i like it very well , but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life .
now , in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well , but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious .
as is it a spare life , look you , it fits my humour well , but as there is no more plenty in it , it goes much against my stomach .
hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is , and that he that wants money , means and content is without three good friends , that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn , that good pasture makes fat sheep , and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun , that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred .
such a one is a natural philosopher .
wast ever in court , shepherd ?
no , truly .
then thou art damned .
nay , i hope .
truly , thou art damned like an egg , all on one side .
for not being at court ?
your reason .
why , if thou never wast at court , thou never sawest good manners , if thou never sawest good manners , then thy manners must be wicked , and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation .
thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
not a whit , touchstone those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court .
you told me you salute not at the court , but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly , if courtiers were shepherds .
instance , briefly , come , instance .
why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
why , do not your courtier hands sweat ?
and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?
shallow , shallow .
a better instance , i say , come .
besides , our hands are hard .
your lips will feel them the sooner .
shallow again .
a more sounder instance , come .
and they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar ?
the courtier hands are perfumed with civet .
most shallow man !
thou , in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed !
learn of the wise , and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat .
mend the instance , shepherd .
you have too courtly a wit for me i rest .
wilt thou rest damned ?
god help thee , shallow man !
god make incision in thee !
thou art raw .
sir , i am a true labourer i earn that i eat , get that i wear , owe no man hate , envy no man happiness , glad of other men good , content with my harm , and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck .
that is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle , to be bawd to a , and to betray a of a twelvemonth to a , old , cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .
if thou beest not damned for this , the devil himself will have no shepherds , i can not see else how thou shouldst .
here comes young master ganymede , my new mistress brother .
enter rosalind , with a paper , reading from the east to western ind , no jewel is like rosalind .
her worth , being mounted on the wind , through all the world bears rosalind .
all the pictures fairest lined are but black to rosalind .
let no fair be kept in mind but the fair of rosalind .
i rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and excepted it is the right rank to market .
out , fool !
for a taste if a hart do lack a hind , let him seek out rosalind .
if the cat will after kind , so be sure will rosalind .
winter garments must be lined , so must slender rosalind .
they that reap must sheaf and bind , then to cart with rosalind .
sweetest nut hath sourest rind , such a nut is rosalind .
he that sweetest rose will find must find love prick and rosalind .
this is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect yourself with them ?
peace , you dull fool !
i found them on a tree .
truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
i graff it with you , and then i shall graff it with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit i ' the country , for you be rotten ere you be half ripe , and that the right virtue of the medlar .
you have said , but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge .
enter celia , with a writing peace !
here comes my sister , reading stand aside .
reads why should this a desert be ?
for it is unpeopled ?
no tongues i hang on every tree , that shall civil sayings show some , how brief the life of man runs his erring pilgrimage , that the stretching of a span buckles in his sum of age , some , of violated vows the souls of friend and friend but upon the fairest boughs , or at every sentence end , will i rosalinda write , teaching all that read to know the quintessence of every sprite heaven would in little show .
therefore heaven nature charged that one body should be fill with all graces nature presently distill helen cheek , but not her heart , cleopatra majesty , atalanta better part , sad lucretia modesty .
thus rosalind of many parts by heavenly synod was devised , of many faces , eyes and hearts , to have the touches dearest prized .
heaven would that she these gifts should have , and i to live and die her slave .
o most gentle pulpiter !
what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal , and never cried patience , good people ! '
how now !
back , friends !
shepherd , go off a little .
go with him , sirrah .
come , shepherd , let us make an honourable retreat , though not with bag and baggage , yet with scrip and scrippage .
exeunt corin and touchstone didst thou hear these verses ?
o , yes , i heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
that no matter the feet might bear the verses .
ay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse .
but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?
i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came , for look here what i found on a .
i was never so since pythagoras ' time , that i was an irish rat , which i can hardly remember .
trow you who hath done this ?
is it a man ?
and a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .
change you colour ?
i prithee , who ?
o lord , lord !
it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
nay , but who is it ?
is it possible ?
nay , i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .
o wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful !
and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all hooping !
good my complexion !
dost thou think , though i am caparisoned like a man , i have a doublet and hose in my disposition ?
one inch of delay more is a of discovery , i prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
i would thou couldst stammer , that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth , as wine comes out of a mouthed bottle , either too much at once , or none at all .
i prithee , take the cork out of thy mouth that may drink thy tidings .
so you may put a man in your belly .
is he of god making ?
what manner of man ?
is his head worth a hat , or his chin worth a beard ?
nay , he hath but a little beard .
why , god will send more , if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
it is young orlando , that tripped up the wrestler heels and your heart both in an instant .
nay , but the devil take mocking speak , sad brow and true maid .
i ' faith , coz , is he .
orlando ?
orlando .
alas the day !
what shall i do with my doublet and hose ?
what did he when thou sawest him ?
what said he ?
how looked he ?
wherein went he ?
what makes him here ?
did he ask for me ?
where remains he ?
how parted he with thee ?
and when shalt thou see him again ?
answer me in one word .
you must borrow me gargantua mouth first is a word too great for any mouth of this age size .
to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism .
but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man apparel ?
looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover , but take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .
i found him under a tree , like a dropped acorn .
it may well be called jove tree , when it drops forth such fruit .
give me audience , good madam .
proceed .
there lay he , stretched along , like a wounded knight .
though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
cry ' to thy tongue , i prithee , it curvets unseasonably .
he was furnished like a hunter .
o , ominous !
he comes to kill my heart .
i would sing my song without a burden thou bringest me out of tune .
do you not know i am a woman ?
when i think , i must speak .
sweet , say on .
you bring me out .
soft !
comes he not here ?
enter orlando and jaques is he slink by , and note him .
i thank you for your company , but , good faith , i had as lief have been myself alone .
and so had i , but yet , for fashion sake , i thank you too for your society .
god be wi ' you let meet as little as we can .
i do desire we may be better strangers .
i pray you , mar no more trees with writing in their barks .
i pray you , mar no more of my verses with reading them .
rosalind is your love name ?
yes , just .
i do not like her name .
there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened .
what stature is she of ?
just as high as my heart .
you are full of pretty answers .
have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths ' wives , and conned them out of rings ?
not so , but i answer you right painted cloth , from whence you have studied your questions .
you have a nimble wit i think was made of atalanta heels .
will you sit down with me ?
and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery .
i will chide no breather in the world but myself , against whom i know most faults .
the worst fault you have is to be in love .
is a fault i will not change for your best virtue .
i am weary of you .
by my troth , i was seeking for a fool when i found you .
he is drowned in the brook look but in , and you shall see him .
there i shall see mine own figure .
which i take to be either a fool or a cipher .
i tarry no longer with you farewell , good signior love .
i am glad of your departure adieu , good monsieur melancholy .
exit jaques aside to celia i will speak to him , like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him .
do you hear , forester ?
very well what would you ?
i pray you , what ?
you should ask me what time o ' day there no clock in the forest .
then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .
and why not the swift foot of time ?
had not that been as proper ?
by no means , sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons .
i tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal .
i prithee , who doth he trot withal ?
marry , he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a , time pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year .
who ambles time withal ?
with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout , for the one sleeps easily because he can not study , and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain , the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning , the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury , these time ambles withal .
who doth he gallop withal ?
with a thief to the gallows , for though he go as softly as foot can fall , he thinks himself too soon there .
who stays it still withal ?
with lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves .
where dwell you , pretty youth ?
with this shepherdess , my sister , here in the skirts of the forest , like fringe upon a petticoat .
are you native of this place ?
as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man , one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love .
i have heard him read many lectures against it , and i thank god i am not a woman , to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal .
can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?
there were none principal , they were all like one another as are , every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it .
i prithee , recount some of them .
no , i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .
there is a man haunts the forest , that abuses our young plants with carving ' on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that i would give him some good counsel , for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him .
i am he that is so i pray you tell me your remedy .
there is none of my uncle marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner .
what were his marks ?
a lean cheek , which you have not , a blue eye and sunken , which you have not , an unquestionable spirit , which you have not , a beard neglected , which you have not , but i pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother revenue then your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation , but you are no such man , you are rather in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
fair youth , i would i could make thee believe i love .
me believe it !
you may as soon make her that you love believe it , which , i warrant , she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences .
but , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees , wherein rosalind is so admired ?
i swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of rosalind , i am that he , that unfortunate he .
but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
love is merely a madness , and , i tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is , that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too .
yet i profess curing it by counsel .
did you ever cure any so ?
yes , one , and in this manner .
he was to imagine me his love , his mistress , and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i , being but a moonish youth , grieve , be effeminate , changeable , longing and liking , proud , fantastical , apish , shallow , inconstant , full of tears , full of smiles , for every passion something and for no passion truly any thing , as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour , would now like him , now loathe him , then entertain him , then forswear him , now weep for him , then spit at him , that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness , which was , to forswear the full stream of the world , and to live in a nook merely monastic .
and thus i cured him , and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep heart , that there shall not be one spot of love i .
i would not be cured , youth .
i would cure you , if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .
now , by the faith of my love , i will tell me where it is .
go with me to it and i show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live .
will you go ?
with all my heart , good youth .
nay you must call me rosalind .
come , sister , will you go ?
exeunt scene iii .
the forest .
enter touchstone and audrey , jaques behind come apace , good audrey i will fetch up your goats , audrey .
and how , audrey ?
am i the man yet ?
doth my simple feature content you ?
your features !
lord warrant us !
what features !
i am here with thee and thy goats , as the most capricious poet , honest ovid , was among the goths .
aside o knowledge , worse than jove in a thatched house !
when a man verses can not be understood , nor a man good wit seconded with the forward child understanding , it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room .
truly , i would the gods had made thee poetical .
i do not know what ' is is it honest in deed and word ?
is it a true thing ?
no , truly , for the truest poetry is the most feigning , and lovers are given to poetry , and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign .
do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?
i do , truly , for thou swearest to me thou art honest now , if thou wert a poet , i might have some hope thou didst feign .
would you not have me honest ?
no , truly , unless thou wert , for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar .
aside a material fool !
well , i am not fair , and therefore i pray the gods make me honest .
truly , and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish .
i am not a slut , though i thank the gods i am foul .
well , praised be the gods for thy foulness !
sluttishness may come hereafter .
but be it as it may be , i will marry thee , and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext , the vicar of the next village , who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us .
aside i would fain see this meeting .
well , the gods give us joy !
amen .
a man may , if he were of a fearful heart , stagger in this attempt , for here we have no temple but the wood , no assembly but .
but what though ?
c ourage !
as horns are odious , they are necessary .
it is said , a man knows no end of his goods ' right , many a man has good horns , and knows no end of them .
well , that is the dowry of his wife , is none of his own getting .
horns ?
even so .
poor men alone ?
no , no , the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
is the single man therefore blessed ?
no as a walled town is more worthier than a village , so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor , and by how much defence is better than no skill , by so much is a horn more precious than to want .
here comes sir oliver .
enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext , you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
is there none here to give the woman ?
i will not take her on gift of any man .
truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .
advancing proceed , proceed i give her .
good even , good master how do you , sir ?
you are very well met god you for your last company i am very glad to see you even a toy in hand here , sir nay , pray be covered .
will you be married , motley ?
as the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires , and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .
and will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?
get you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot , then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well , and not being well married , it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife .
go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
, sweet audrey we must be married , or we must live in bawdry .
farewell , good master oliver not , o sweet oliver , o brave oliver , leave me not behind thee but , wind away , begone , i say , i will not to wedding with thee .
exeunt jaques , touchstone and audrey is no matter a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .
exit scene iv .
the forest .
enter rosalind and celia never talk to me , i will weep .
do , i prithee , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man .
but have i not cause to weep ?
as good cause as one would desire , therefore weep .
his very hair is of the dissembling colour .
something browner than judas marry , his kisses are judas own children .
i ' faith , his hair is of a good colour .
an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour .
and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .
he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winter sisterhood kisses not more religiously , the very ice of chastity is in them .
but why did he swear he would come this morning , and comes not ?
nay , certainly , there is no truth in him .
do you think so ?
yes , i think he is not a nor a , but for his verity in love , i do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a nut .
not true in love ?
yes , when he is in , but i think he is not in .
you have heard him swear downright he was .
' is not ' besides , the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster , they are both the confirmer of false reckonings .
he attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was , i told him , of as good as he , so he laughed and let me go .
but what talk we of fathers , when there is such a man as orlando ?
o , that a brave man !
he writes brave verses , speaks brave words , swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely , quite traverse , athwart the heart of his lover , as a puisny tilter , that spurs his horse but on one side , breaks his staff like a noble goose but all brave that youth mounts and folly guides .
who comes here ?
enter corin mistress and master , you have oft inquired after the shepherd that complain of love , who you saw sitting by me on the turf , praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress .
well , and what of him ?
if you will see a pageant truly play , between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain , go hence a little and i shall conduct you , if you will mark it .
o , come , let us remove the sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
bring us to this sight , and you shall say i prove a busy actor in their play .
exeunt scene another part of the forest .
enter silvius and phebe sweet phebe , do not scorn me , do not , phebe , say that you love me not , but say not so in bitterness .
the common executioner , whose heart the accustom sight of death makes hard , falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops ?
enter rosalind , celia , and corin , behind i would not be thy executioner i fly thee , for i would not injure thee .
thou me there is murder in mine eye is pretty , sure , and very probable , that eyes , that are the and softest things , who shut their coward gates on atomies , should be call tyrants , butchers , murderers !
now i do frown on thee with all my heart , and if mine eyes can wound , now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swoon , why now fall down , or if thou canst not , o , for shame , for shame , lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers !
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin , and there remains some scar of it , lean but upon a rush , the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps , but now mine eyes , which i have darted at thee , hurt thee not , nor , i am sure , there is no force in eyes that can do hurt .
o dear phebe , if ever , as that ever may be near , you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy , then shall you know the wounds invisible that love keen arrows make .
but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes , afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , as till that time i shall not pity thee .
and why , i pray you ?
who might be your mother , that you insult , exult , and all at once , over the wretched ?
what though you have no beauty , as , by my faith , i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed must you be therefore proud and pitiless ?
why , what means this ?
why do you look on me ?
i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature .
my little life , i think she means to tangle my eyes too !
no , faith , proud mistress , hope not after it is not your inky brows , your black silk hair , your bugle eyeballs , nor your cheek of cream , that can entame my spirits to your worship .
you foolish shepherd , wherefore do you follow her , like foggy south puffing with wind and rain ?
you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman is such fools as you that makes the world full of children is not her glass , but you , that flatters her , and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her .
but , mistress , know yourself down on your knees , and thank heaven , fasting , for a good man love for i must tell you friendly in your ear , sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer foul is most foul , being foul to be a scoffer .
so take her to thee , shepherd fare you well .
sweet youth , i pray you , chide a year together i had rather hear you chide than this man woo .
he fallen in love with your foulness and she fall in love with my anger .
if it be so , as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks , i sauce her with bitter words .
why look you so upon me ?
for no ill will i bear you .
i pray you , do not fall in love with me , for i am falser than vows made in wine besides , i like you not .
if you will know my house , is at the tuft of olives here hard by .
will you go , sister ?
shepherd , ply her hard .
come , sister .
shepherdess , look on him better , and be not proud though all the world could see , none could be so abused in sight as he .
come , to our flock .
exeunt rosalind , celia and corin dead shepherd , now i find thy saw of might , ever loved that loved not at first sight ? '
sweet phebe , ha , what thou , silvius ?
sweet phebe , pity me .
why , i am sorry for thee , gentle silvius .
wherever sorrow is , relief would be if you do sorrow at my grief in love , by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermined .
thou hast my love is not that neighbourly ?
i would have you .
why , that were covetousness .
silvius , the time was that i hated thee , and yet it is not that i bear thee love , but since that thou canst talk of love so well , thy company , which erst was irksome to me , i will endure , and i employ thee too but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employ .
so holy and so perfect is my love , and i in such a poverty of grace , that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scatter smile , and that i live upon .
now the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?
not very well , but i have met him oft , and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of .
think not i love him , though i ask for him is but a peevish boy , yet he talks well , but what care i for words ?
yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear .
it is a pretty youth not very pretty but , sure , he proud , and yet his pride becomes him he make a proper man the best thing in him is his complexion , and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up .
he is not very tall , yet for his years he tall his leg is but so so , and yet is well there was a pretty redness in his lip , a little riper and more lusty red than that mix in his cheek , was just the difference between the constant red and mingled damask .
there be some women , silvius , had they mark him in parcels as i did , would have gone near to fall in love with him , but , for my part , i love him not nor hate him not , and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me ?
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and , now i am remember , scorn at me i marvel why i answer not again but that all one , omittance is no quittance .
i write to him a very taunting letter , and thou shalt bear it wilt thou , silvius ?
phebe , with all my heart .
i write it straight , the matter in my head and in my heart i will be bitter with him and passing short .
go with me , silvius .
exeunt act iv scene i .
the forest .
enter rosalind , celia , and jaques i prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
they say you are a melancholy fellow .
i am so , i do love it better than laughing .
those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards .
why , is good to be sad and say nothing .
why then , is good to be a post .
i have neither the scholar melancholy , which is emulation , nor the musician , which is fantastical , nor the courtier , which is proud , nor the soldier , which is ambitious , nor the lawyer , which is politic , nor the lady , which is nice , nor the lover , which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness .
a traveller !
by my faith , you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men , then , to have seen much and to have nothing , is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
yes , i have gained my experience .
and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad , and to travel for it too !
enter orlando good day and happiness , dear rosalind !
nay , then , god be wi ' you , an you talk in blank verse .
exit farewell , monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits , disable all the benefits of your own country , be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are , or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola .
why , how now , orlando !
where have you been all this while ?
you a lover !
an you serve me such another trick , never come in my sight more .
my fair rosalind , i come within an hour of my promise .
break an hour promise in love !
he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love , it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o ' the shoulder , but i warrant him .
pardon me , dear rosalind .
nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight i had as lief be wooed of a snail .
of a snail ?
ay , of a snail , for though he comes slowly , he carries his house on his head , a better jointure , i think , than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him .
what that ?
why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
virtue is no , and my rosalind is virtuous .
and i am your rosalind .
it pleases him to call you so , but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you .
come , woo me , woo me , for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent .
what would you say to me now , an i were your very very rosalind ?
i would kiss before i spoke .
nay , you were better speak first , and when you were gravelled for lack of matter , you might take occasion to kiss .
very good orators , when they are out , they will spit , and for lovers lacking god warn us ! matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
how if the kiss be denied ?
then she puts you to entreaty , and there begins new matter .
who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
marry , that should you , if i were your mistress , or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
what , of my suit ?
not out of your apparel , and yet out of your suit .
am not i your rosalind ?
i take some joy to say you are , because i would be talking of her .
well in her person i say i will not have you .
then in mine own person i die .
no , faith , die by attorney .
the poor world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person , videlicit , in a .
troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club , yet he did what he could to die before , and he is one of the patterns of love .
leander , he would have lived many a fair year , though hero had turned nun , if it had not been for a hot midsummer night , for , good youth , he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was of sestos . '
but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them , but not for love .
i would not have my right rosalind of this mind , for , i protest , her frown might kill me .
by this hand , it will not kill a fly .
but come , now i will be your rosalind in a more disposition , and ask me what you will .
i will grant it .
then love me , rosalind .
yes , faith , will i , fridays and saturdays and all .
and wilt thou have me ?
ay , and twenty such .
what sayest thou ?
are you not good ?
i hope so .
why then , can one desire too much of a good thing ?
come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us .
give me your hand , orlando .
what do you say , sister ?
pray thee , marry us .
i can not say the words .
you must begin , you , orlando ' go to .
will you , orlando , have to wife this rosalind ?
i will .
ay , but when ?
why now , as fast as she can marry us .
then you must say ' i take thee , rosalind , for wife . '
i take thee , rosalind , for wife .
i might ask you for your commission , but i do take thee , orlando , for my husband there a girl goes before the priest , and certainly a woman thought runs before her actions .
so do all thoughts , they are winged .
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
for ever and a day .
say ' a day , ' without the . '
no , no , orlando , men are april when they woo , december when they wed maids are may when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .
i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing , like diana in the fountain , and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry , i will laugh like a hyen , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
but will my rosalind do so ?
by my life , she will do as i do .
o , but she is wise .
or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser , the waywarder make the doors upon a woman wit and it will out at the casement , shut that and out at the , stop that , fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
a man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say , whither wilt ? '
nay , you might keep that cheque for it till you met your wife wit going to your neighbour bed .
and what wit could wit have to excuse that ?
marry , to say she came to seek you there .
you shall never take her without her answer , unless you take her without her tongue .
o , that woman that can not make her fault her husband occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool !
for these two hours , rosalind , i will leave thee .
alas !
dear love , i can not lack thee two hours .
i must attend the duke at dinner by two i will be with thee again .
ay , go your ways , go your ways , i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much , and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me is but one cast away , and so , come , death !
two is your hour ?
ay , sweet rosalind .
by my troth , and in good earnest , and so god mend me , and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous , if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour , i will think you the most pathetical and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise .
with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind so adieu .
well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try adieu .
exit orlando you have simply misused our sex in your we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head , and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest .
o coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love !
but it can not be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom , like the bay of portugal .
or rather , bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
no , that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses every one eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep i am in love .
i tell thee , aliena , i can not be out of the sight of orlando i go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
and i sleep .
exeunt scene ii .
the forest .
enter jaques , lords , and foresters which is he that killed the deer ?
sir , it was i .
let present him to the duke , like a roman conqueror , and it would do well to set the deer horns upon his head , for a branch of victory .
have you no song , forester , for this purpose ?
yes , sir .
sing it is no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
song .
what shall he have that kill the deer ?
his leather skin and horns to wear .
then sing him home , the rest shall bear this burden take thou no scorn to wear the horn , it was a crest ere thou wast born thy father father wore it , and thy father bore it the horn , the horn , the lusty horn is not a thing to laugh to scorn .
exeunt scene iii .
the forest .
enter rosalind and celia how say you now ?
is it not past two ?
and here much orlando !
i warrant you , with pure love and troubled brain , he hath his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep .
look , who comes here .
enter silvius my errand is to you , fair youth , my gentle phebe bid me give you this i know not the contents , but , as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it , it bears an angry tenor pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger .
patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer , bear this , bear all she says i am not fair , that i lack manners , she calls me proud , and that she could not love me , were man as rare as phoenix .
my will !
her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me ?
well , shepherd , well , this is a letter of your own device .
no , i protest , i know not the contents phebe did write it .
come , come , you are a fool and turn into the extremity of love .
i saw her hand she has a leathern hand .
a hand , i verily did think that her old gloves were on , but was her hands she has a huswife hand , but that no matter i say she never did invent this letter , this is a man invention and his hand .
sure , it is hers .
why , is a boisterous and a cruel style .
a style , why , she defies me , like turk to christian women gentle brain could not drop forth such invention such ethiope words , blacker in their effect than in their countenance .
will you hear the letter ?
so please you , for i never heard it yet , yet heard too much of phebe cruelty .
she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes .
reads art thou god to shepherd turn , that a maiden heart hath burn ?
can a woman rail thus ?
call you this railing ?
reads why , thy godhead laid apart , thou with a woman heart ?
did you ever hear such railing ?
whiles the eye of man did woo me , that could do no vengeance to me .
meaning me a beast .
if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine , alack , in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect !
whiles you chid me , i did love , how then might your prayers move !
he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind , whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make , or else by him my love deny , and then i study how to die .
call you this chiding ?
alas , poor shepherd !
do you pity him ?
no , he deserves no pity .
wilt thou love such a woman ?
what , to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee !
not to be endured !
well , go your way to her , for i see love hath made thee a tame snake , and say this to her that if she love me , i charge her to love thee , if she will not , i will never have her unless thou entreat for her .
if you be a true lover , hence , and not a word , for here comes more company .
exit silvius enter oliver good morrow , fair ones pray you , if you know , where in the purlieus of this forest stands a fenced about with olive trees ?
west of this place , down in the neighbour bottom the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place .
but at this hour the house doth keep itself , there none within .
if that an eye may profit by a tongue , then should i know you by description , such garments and such years boy is fair , of female favour , and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother . '
are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for ?
it is no boast , being ask , to say we are .
orlando doth commend him to you both , and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin .
are you he ?
i am what must we understand by this ?
some of my shame , if you will know of me what man i am , and how , and why , and where this handkercher was stain .
i pray you , tell it .
when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour , and pacing through the forest , chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy , lo , what befell !
he threw his eye aside , and mark what object did present itself under an oak , whose boughs were moss with age and high top bald with dry antiquity , a wretched ragged man , with hair , lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself , who with her head nimble in threats approach the opening of his mouth , but suddenly , seeing orlando , it unlink itself , and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush shade a lioness , with udders all drawn dry , lay couching , head on ground , with catlike watch , when that the sleeping man should stir , for is the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen , orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother , his elder brother .
o , i have heard him speak of that same brother , and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men .
and well he might so do , for well i know he was unnatural .
but , to orlando did he leave him there , food to the suck and hungry lioness ?
twice did he turn his back and purposed so , but kindness , nobler ever than revenge , and nature , stronger than his just occasion , made him give battle to the lioness , who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked .
are you his brother ?
wast you he rescued ?
you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
was i , but is not i i do not shame to tell you what i was , since my conversion so sweetly tastes , being the thing i am .
but , for the bloody napkin ?
by and by .
when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed , as how i came into that desert place in brief , he led me to the gentle duke , who gave me fresh array and entertainment , committing me unto my brother love , who led me instantly unto his cave , there stripp himself , and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away , which all this while had bled , and now he fainted and cried , in fainting , upon rosalind .
brief , i recover him , bound up his wound , and , after some small space , being strong at heart , he sent me hither , stranger as i am , to tell this story , that you might excuse his broken promise , and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind .
rosalind swoons why , how now , ganymede !
sweet ganymede !
many will swoon when they do look on blood .
there is more in it .
cousin ganymede !
look , he recovers .
i would i were at home .
we lead you thither .
i pray you , will you take him by the arm ?

and loving woo ?
and , wooing , she should grant ?
and will you persever to enjoy her ?
neither call the giddiness of it in question , the poverty of her , the small acquaintance , my sudden wooing , nor her sudden consenting , but say with me , i love aliena , say with her that she loves me , consent with both that we may enjoy each other it shall be to your good , for my father house and all the revenue that was old sir rowland will i estate upon you , and here live and die a shepherd .
you have my consent .
let your wedding be thither will i invite the duke and all contented followers .
go you and prepare aliena , for look you , here comes my rosalind .
enter rosalind god save you , brother .
and you , fair sister .
exit o , my dear orlando , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf !
it is my arm .
i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
wounded it is , but with the eyes of a lady .
did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkerchief ?
ay , and greater wonders than that .
o , i know where you are nay , is true there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar thrasonical brag of ' i came , saw , and overcame ' for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked , no sooner looked but they loved , no sooner loved but they sighed , no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason , no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy , and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent , or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together , clubs can not part them .
they shall be married , and i will bid the duke to the nuptial .
but , o , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man eyes !
by so much the more shall i be at the height of , by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .
why then , i can not serve your turn for rosalind ?
i can live no longer by thinking .
i will weary you then no longer with idle talking .
know of me then , for now i speak to some purpose , that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch i say i know you are , neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you , to do yourself good and not to grace me .
believe then , if you please , that i can do strange things i have , since i was three year old , conversed with a magician , most profound in his art and yet not damnable .
if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries aliena , shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger .
speakest thou in sober meanings ?
by my life , i do , which i tender dearly , though i say i am a magician .
therefore , put you in your best array bid your friends , for if you will be married , you shall , and to rosalind , if you will .

song .
it was a lover and his lass , with a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , that the green did pass in the spring time , the only pretty ring time , when birds do sing , hey ding a ding , ding sweet lovers love the spring .
between the acres of the rye , with a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino these pretty country folks would lie , in spring time , and this carol they began that hour , with a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , how that a life was but a flower in spring time , and and therefore take the present time , with a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , for love is crowned with the prime in spring time , and truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untuneable .
you are deceived , sir we kept time , we lost not our time .

enter duke senior , amiens , jaques , orlando , oliver , and celia dost thou believe , orlando , that the boy can do all this that he hath promised ?
i sometimes do believe , and sometimes do not , as those that fear they hope , and know they fear .
enter rosalind , silvius , and phebe patience once more , whiles our compact is urged you say , if i bring in your rosalind , you will bestow her on orlando here ?
that would i , had i kingdoms to give with her .
and you say , you will have her , when i bring her ?
that would i , were i of all kingdoms king .
you say , you marry me , if i be willing ?
that will i , should i die the hour after .
but if you do refuse to marry me , you give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
so is the bargain .
you say , that you have phebe , if she will ?
though to have her and death were both one thing .
i have promised to make all this matter even .
keep you your word , o duke , to give your daughter , you yours , orlando , to receive his daughter keep your word , phebe , that you marry me , or else refusing me , to wed this shepherd keep your word , silvius , that you marry her .
if she refuse me and from hence i go , to make these doubts all even .
exeunt rosalind and celia i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter favour .
my lord , the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter but , my good lord , this boy is , and hath been tutor in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle , whom he reports to be a great magician , obscured in the circle of this forest .
enter touchstone and audrey there is , sure , another flood toward , and these couples are coming to the ark .
here comes a pair of very strange beasts , which in all tongues are called fools .
salutation and greeting to you all !
good my lord , bid him welcome this is the gentleman that i have so often met in the forest he hath been a courtier , he swears .
if any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .
i have trod a measure , i have flattered a lady , i have been politic with my friend , smooth with mine enemy , i have undone three tailors , i have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
and how was that up ?
faith , we met , and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
how seventh cause ?
good my lord , like this fellow .
i like him very well .
god you , sir , i desire you of the like .
i press in here , sir , amongst the rest of the country copulatives , to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin , sir , an thing , sir , but mine own , a poor humour of mine , sir , to take that that no man else will rich honesty dwells like a miser , sir , in a poor house , as your pearl in your foul oyster .
by my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
according to the fool bolt , sir , and such dulcet diseases .
but , for the seventh cause , how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
upon a lie seven times removed bear your body more seeming , audrey as thus , sir .
i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier beard he sent me word , if i said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was this is called the retort courteous .
if i sent him word again was not well cut , ' he would send me word , he cut it to please himself this is called the quip modest .
if again was not well cut , ' he disabled my judgment this is called the reply churlish .
if again was not well cut , ' he would answer , i spake not true this is called the reproof valiant .
if again was not well cut , ' he would say i lied this is called the quarrelsome and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct .
and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?
i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial , nor he durst not give me the lie direct , and so we measured swords and parted .
can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie ?
o sir , we quarrel in print , by the book , as you have books for good manners i will name you the degrees .
the first , the retort courteous , the second , the quip modest , the third , the reply churlish , the fourth , the reproof valiant , the fifth , the countercheque quarrelsome , the sixth , the lie with circumstance , the seventh , the lie direct .
all these you may avoid but the lie direct , and you may avoid that too , with an if .
i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel , but when the parties were met themselves , one of them thought but of an if , as , you said so , then i said so , ' and they shook hands and swore brothers .
your if is the only peacemaker , much virtue in if .
is not this a rare fellow , my lord ?
he as good at any thing and yet a fool .
he uses his folly like a and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
enter hymen , rosalind , and celia still music then is there mirth in heaven , when earthly things made even atone together .
good duke , receive thy daughter hymen from heaven brought her , yea , brought her hither , that thou mightst join her hand with his whose heart within his bosom is .
to duke senior to you i give myself , for i am yours .
to orlando to you i give myself , for i am yours .
if there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .
if there be truth in sight , you are my rosalind .
if sight and shape be true , why then , my love adieu !
i have no father , if you be not he i have no husband , if you be not he nor wed woman , if you be not she .
peace , ho !
i bar confusion is i must make conclusion of these most strange events here eight that must take hands to join in hymen bands , if truth holds true contents .
you and you no cross shall part you and you are heart in heart you to his love must accord , or have a woman to your lord you and you are sure together , as the winter to foul weather .

o my dear niece , welcome thou art to me !
even daughter , welcome , in no less degree .
i will not eat my word , now thou art mine , thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine .
enter jaques de boys let me have audience for a word or two i am the second son of old sir rowland , that bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
duke frederick , hearing how that every day men of great worth resorted to this forest , address a mighty power , which were on foot , in his own conduct , purposely to take his brother here and put him to the sword and to the skirts of this wild wood he came , where meeting with an old religious man , after some question with him , was converted both from his enterprise and from the world , his crown bequeathing to his banish brother , and all their lands restored to them again that were with him exiled .
this to be true , i do engage my life .
welcome , young man , thou fairly to thy brothers ' wedding to one his lands withheld , and to the other a land itself at large , a potent dukedom .
first , in this forest , let us do those ends that here were well begun and well begot and after , every of this happy number that have endured shrewd days and nights with us shall share the good of our returned fortune , according to the measure of their states .
meantime , forget this dignity and fall into our rustic revelry .
play , music !
and you , brides and bridegrooms all , with measure heap in joy , to the measures fall .
sir , by your patience .
if i heard you rightly , the duke hath put on a religious life and thrown into neglect the pompous court ?
he hath .
to him will i out of these convertites there is much matter to be heard and learn .
to duke senior you to your former honour i bequeath , your patience and your virtue well deserves it to orlando you to a love that your true faith doth merit to oliver you to your land and love and great allies to silvius you to a long and bed to touchstone and you to wrangling , for thy loving voyage is but for two months victuall .
so , to your pleasures i am for other than for dancing measures .
stay , jaques , stay .
to see no pastime i what you would have i stay to know at your abandon cave .
exit proceed , proceed we will begin these rites , as we do trust they end , in true delights .
a dance epilogue it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue , but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue .
if it be true that good wine needs no bush , is true that a good play needs no epilogue , yet to good wine they do use good bushes , and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues .
what a case am i in then , that am neither a good epilogue nor can not insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play !
i am not furnished like a beggar , therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you , and i begin with the women .
i charge you , o women , for the love you bear to men , to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you , o men , for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simpering , none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please .
if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me , complexions that liked me and breaths that i defied not and , i am sure , as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will , for my kind offer , when i make curtsy , bid me farewell .

exeunt mark antony and cleopatra with their train is caesar with antonius prized so slight ?

enobarbus !
madam ?

where alexas ?
here , at your service .
my lord approaches .
we will not look upon him go with us .
exeunt enter mark antony with a messenger and attendants fulvia thy wife first came into the field .
against my brother lucius ?
ay but soon that war had end , and the time state made friends of them , joining their force caesar , whose better issue in the war , from italy , upon the first encounter , drave them .
well , what worst ?
the nature of bad news infects the teller .
when it concerns the fool or coward .
on things that are past are done with me .
is thus who tells me true , though in his tale lie death , i hear him as he flatter .
labienus this is stiff news hath , with his parthian force , extended asia from euphrates , his conquering banner shook from syria to lydia and to ionia , whilst antony , thou wouldst say , o , my lord !
speak to me home , mince not the general tongue name cleopatra as she is call in rome , rail thou in fulvia phrase , and taunt my faults with such full licence as both truth and malice have power to utter .
o , then we bring forth weeds , when our quick minds lie still , and our ills told us is as our earing .
fare thee well awhile .
at your noble pleasure .
exit from sicyon , ho , the news !
speak there !
the man from sicyon , is there such an one ?
he stays upon your will .
let him appear .
these strong egyptian fetters i must break , or lose myself in dotage .
enter another messenger what are you ?
fulvia thy wife is dead .
where died she ?
in sicyon her length of sickness , with what else more serious importeth thee to know , this bears .
gives a letter forbear me .
exit second messenger there a great spirit gone !
thus did i desire it what our contempt doth often hurl from us , we wish it ours again , the present pleasure , by revolution lowering , does become the opposite of itself she good , being gone , the hand could pluck her back that shoved her on .
i must from this enchanting queen break off ten thousand harms , more than the ills i know , my idleness doth hatch .
how now !
enobarbus !
domitius enobarbus what your pleasure , sir ?
i must with haste from hence .
why , then , we kill all our women we see how mortal an unkindness is to them , if they suffer our departure , death the word .
i must be gone .
under a compelling occasion , let women die , it were pity to cast them away for nothing , though , between them and a great cause , they should be esteemed nothing .
cleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly , i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment i do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
she is cunning past man thought .
exit alexas alack , sir , no , her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love we can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears , they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report this can not be cunning in her , if it be , she makes a shower of rain as well as jove .
would i had never seen her .
o , sir , you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work , which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel .
fulvia is dead .
sir ?
fulvia is dead .
fulvia !
dead .
why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice .
when it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him , it shows to man the tailors of the earth , comforting therein , that when old robes are worn out , there are members to make new .
if there were no more women but fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned with consolation , your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
the business she hath broached in the state can not endure my absence .
and the business you have broached here can not be without you , especially that of cleopatra , which wholly depends on your abode .
no more light answers .
let our officers have notice what we purpose .
i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen , and get her leave to part .
for not alone the death of fulvia , with more urgent touches , do strongly speak to us , but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar , and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people , whose love is never link to the deserver till his deserts are past , begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son , who , high in name and power , higher than both in blood and life , stands up for the main soldier whose quality , going on , the sides o ' the world may danger much is breeding , which , like the courser hair , hath yet but life , and not a serpent poison .
say , our pleasure , to such whose place is under us , requires our quick remove from hence .
i shall .

enter mark antony i am sick and sullen .
i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose , help me away , dear charmian , i shall fall it can not be thus long , the sides of nature will not sustain it .
now , my dearest queen , pray you , stand further from me .
what the matter ?
i know , by that same eye , there some good news .
what says the married woman ?
you may go would she had never given you leave to come !
let her not say is i that keep you here i have no power upon you , hers you are .
the gods best know , o , never was there queen so mightily betray !
yet at the first i saw the treasons planted .
cleopatra , why should i think you can be mine and true , though you in swearing shake the throned gods , who have been false to fulvia ?
riotous madness , to be entangled with those vows , which break themselves in swearing !
most sweet queen , nay , pray you , seek no colour for your going , but bid farewell , and go when you sued staying , then was the time for words no going then , eternity was in our lips and eyes , bliss in our brows ' bent , none our parts so poor , but was a race of heaven they are so still , or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , art turn the greatest liar .
how now , lady !
i would i had thy inches , thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt .
hear me , queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile , but my full heart remains in use with you .
our italy shines with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated , grown to strength , are newly grown to love the condemn pompey , rich in his father honour , creeps apace , into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state , whose numbers threaten , and quietness , grown sick of rest , would purge by any desperate change my more particular , and that which most with you should safe my going , is fulvia death .
though age from folly could not give me freedom , it does from childishness can fulvia die ?
she dead , my queen look here , and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked , at the last , best see when and where she died .
o most false love !
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water ?
now i see , i see , in fulvia death , how mine received shall be .
quarrel no more , but be prepared to know the purposes i bear , which are , or cease , as you shall give the advice .
by the fire that quickens nilus ' slime , i go from hence thy soldier , servant , making peace or war as thou .
cut my lace , charmian , come , but let it be i am quickly ill , and well , so antony loves .
my precious queen , forbear , and give true evidence to his love , which stands an honourable trial .
so fulvia told me .
i prithee , turn aside and weep for her , then bid adieu to me , and say the tears belong to egypt good now , play one scene of excellent dissembling , and let it look life perfect honour .
you heat my blood no more .
you can do better yet , but this is meetly .
now , by my sword , and target .
still he mends , but this is not the best .
look , prithee , charmian , how this herculean roman does become the carriage of his chafe .
i leave you , lady .
courteous lord , one word .
sir , you and i must part , but that not it sir , you and i have loved , but there not it , that you know well something it is i would , o , my oblivion is a very antony , and i am all forgotten .
but that your royalty holds idleness your subject , i should take you for idleness itself .
is sweating labour to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this .
but , sir , forgive me , since my becomings kill me , when they do not eye well to you your honour calls you hence , therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly .
and all the gods go with you !
upon your sword sit laurel victory !
and smooth success be strew before your feet !
let us go .
come , our separation so abides , and flies , that thou , residing here , yet with me , and i , hence fleeting , here remain with thee .
away !

i must not think there are evils enow to darken all his goodness his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven , more fiery by night blackness , hereditary , rather than purchased , what he can not change , than what he chooses .
you are too indulgent .
let us grant , it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy , to give a kingdom for a mirth , to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave , to reel the streets at noon , and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him , as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things can not blemish , yet must antony no way excuse his soils , when we do bear so great weight in his lightness .
if he fill his vacancy with his voluptuousness , full surfeits , and the dryness of his bones , call on him but to confound such time , that drums him from his sport , and speaks as loud as his own state and ours , is to be chid as we rate boys , who , being mature in knowledge , pawn their experience to their present pleasure , and so rebel to judgment .
enter a messenger here more news .
thy biddings have been done , and every hour , most noble caesar , shalt thou have report how is abroad .
pompey is strong at sea , and it appears he is beloved of those that only have fear caesar to the ports the discontents repair , and men reports give him much wrong .
i should have known no less .
it hath been taught us from the primal state , that he which is was wish until he were , and the ebb man , loved till worth love , comes dear by being lack .
this common body , like to a vagabond flag upon the stream , goes to and back , lackeying the varying tide , to rot itself with motion .
caesar , i bring thee word , menecrates and menas , famous pirates , make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound with keels of every kind many hot inroads they make in italy , the borders maritime lack blood to think o , and flush youth revolt no vessel can peep forth , but is as soon taken as seen , for pompey name strikes more than could his war resisted .
antony , leave thy lascivious wassails .
when thou once wast beaten from modena , where thou hirtius and pansa , consuls , at thy heel did famine follow , whom thou against , though daintily brought up , with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses , and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge , yea , like the stag , when snow the pasture sheets , the barks of trees thou , on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh , which some did die to look on and all this it wounds thine honour that i speak it now was borne so like a soldier , that thy cheek so much as lank not .
is pity of him .
let his shames quickly drive him to rome is time we twain did show ourselves i ' the field , and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness .
, caesar , i shall be furnish to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time .
till which encounter , it is my business too .
farewell .
farewell , my lord what you shall know meantime of stirs abroad , i shall beseech you , sir , to let me be partaker .

yes , gracious madam .

not in deed , madam , for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done yet have i fierce affections , and think what venus did with mars .

caesar , when thou wast here above the ground , i was a morsel for a monarch and great pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow , there would he anchor his aspect and die with looking on his life .
enter alexas , from octavius caesar sovereign of egypt , hail !
how much unlike art thou mark antony !
yet , coming from him , that great medicine hath with his tinct gilded thee .
how goes it with my brave mark antony ?
last thing he did , dear queen , he kiss , the last of many doubled kisses , this orient pearl .
his speech sticks in my heart .
mine ear must pluck it thence .
friend , ' quoth he , , the firm roman to great egypt sends this treasure of an oyster , at whose foot , to mend the petty present , i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms , all the east , say thou , shall call her mistress . '
so he nodded , and soberly did mount an steed , who neigh so high , that what i would have spoke was beastly dumb by him .
what , was he sad or merry ?
like to the time o ' the year between the extremes of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry .
o disposition !
note him , note him good charmian , is the man , but note him he was not sad , for he would shine on those that make their looks by his , he was not merry , which seem to tell them his remembrance lay in egypt with his joy , but between both o heavenly mingle !
thou sad or merry , the violence of either thee becomes , so does it no man else .

ay , madam , twenty several messengers why do you send so thick ?
who born that day when i forget to send to antony , shall die a beggar .

welcome , my good alexas .
did i , charmian , ever love caesar so ?
o that brave caesar !
be choked with such another emphasis !
say , the brave antony .
the valiant caesar !

know , worthy pompey , that what they do delay , they not deny .
whiles we are suitors to their throne , decays the thing we sue for .
we , ignorant of ourselves , beg often our own harms , which the wise powers deny us for our good , so find we profit by losing of our prayers .
i shall do well the people love me , and the sea is mine , my powers are crescent , and my auguring hope says it will come to the full .

where have you this ?

i can not hope caesar and antony shall well greet together his wife that dead did trespasses to caesar , his brother warr upon him , although , i think , not moved by antony .
i know not , menas , how lesser enmities may give way to greater .
not that we stand up against them all , pregnant they should square between themselves , for they have entertained cause enough to draw their swords but how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference , we yet not know .

what amiss , may it be gently heard when we debate our trivial difference loud , we do commit murder in healing wounds then , noble partners , the rather , for i earnestly beseech , touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms , nor curstness grow to the matter .
is spoken well .
were we before our armies , and to fight .

flourish welcome to rome .
thank you .

nay , then .
i learn , you take things ill which are not so , or being , concern you not .
i must be laugh at , if , or for nothing or a little , i should say myself offended , and with you chiefly i ' the world , more laugh at , that i should once name you derogately , when to sound your name it not concern me .
my being in egypt , caesar , what to you ?
no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet , if you there did practise on my state , your being in egypt might be my question .
how intend you , practised ?
you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befal me .
your wife and brother made wars upon me , and their contestation was theme for you , you were the word of war .
you do mistake your business , my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it , and have my learning from some true reports , that drew their swords with you .
did he not rather discredit my authority with yours , and make the wars alike against my stomach , having alike your cause ?
of this my letters before did satisfy you .
if you patch a quarrel , as matter whole you have not to make it with , it must not be with this .
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me , but you patch up your excuses .
not so , not so , i know you could not lack , i am certain o , very necessity of this thought , that i , your partner in the cause which he fought , could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace .
as for my wife , i would you had her spirit in such another the third o ' the world is yours , which with a snaffle you may pace easy , but not such a wife .
would we had all such wives , that the men might go to wars with the women !
so much uncurbable , her garboils , caesar made out of her impatience , which not wanted shrewdness of policy too , i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say , i could not help it .
i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria , you did pocket up my letters , and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience .
sir , he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted , and did want of what i was i ' the morning but next day i told him of myself , which was as much as to have ask him pardon .
let this fellow be nothing of our strife , if we contend , out of our question wipe him .
you have broken the article of your oath , which you shall never have tongue to charge me with .
soft , caesar !
no , lepidus , let him speak the honour is sacred which he talks on now , supposing that i lack it .
but , on , caesar , the article of my oath .
to lend me arms and aid when i required them , the which you both denied .
neglected , rather , and then when poison hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge .
as nearly as i may , i play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness , nor my power work without it .
truth is , that fulvia , to have me out of egypt , made wars here , for which myself , the ignorant motive , do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case .
is noble spoken .
if it might please you , to enforce no further the griefs between ye to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you .
worthily spoken , mecaenas .
or , if you borrow one another love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of pompey , return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
thou art a soldier only speak no more .
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot .
you wrong this presence , therefore speak no more .
go to , then , your considerate stone .
i do not much dislike the matter , but the manner of his speech , can not be we shall remain in friendship , our conditions so differing in their acts .
yet if i knew what hoop should hold us stanch , from edge to edge o ' the world i would pursue it .
give me leave , caesar , speak , agrippa .
thou hast a sister by the mother side , admired octavia great mark antony is now a widower .
say not so , agrippa if cleopatra heard you , your reproof were well deserved of rashness .
i am not married , caesar let me hear agrippa further speak .
to hold you in perpetual amity , to make you brothers , and to knit your hearts with an unslipping knot , take antony octavia to his wife , whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men , whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter .
by this marriage , all little jealousies , which now seem great , and all great fears , which now import their dangers , would then be nothing truths would be tales , where now half tales be truths her love to both would , each to other and all loves to both , draw after her .
pardon what i have spoke , for is a studied , not a present thought , by duty ruminated .
will caesar speak ?
not till he hears how antony is touch with what is spoke already .
what power is in agrippa , if i would say , , be it so , ' to make this good ?
the power of caesar , and his power unto octavia .
may i never to this good purpose , that so fairly shows , dream of impediment !
let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs !
there is my hand .
a sister i bequeath you , whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never fly off our loves again !
happily , amen !
i did not think to draw my sword pompey , for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only , lest my remembrance suffer ill report , at heel of that , defy him .
time calls upon of us must pompey presently be sought , or else he seeks out us .
where lies he ?
about the mount misenum .
what is his strength by land ?
great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master .
so is the fame .
would we had spoke together !
haste we for it yet , ere we put ourselves in arms , dispatch we the business we have talk of .
with most gladness and do invite you to my sister view , whither straight i lead you .
let us , lepidus , not lack your company .
noble antony , not sickness should detain me .
flourish .
exeunt octavius caesar , mark antony , and lepidus welcome from egypt , sir .
half the heart of caesar , worthy mecaenas !
my honourable friend , agrippa !
good enobarbus !
we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
you stayed well by in egypt .
ay , sir , we did sleep day out of countenance , and made the night light with drinking .
eight roasted whole at a breakfast , and but twelve persons there , is this true ?
this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
she a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
when she first met mark antony , she pursed up his heart , upon the river of cydnus .
there she appeared indeed , or my reporter devised well for her .
i will tell you .
the barge she sat in , like a burnish throne , burn on the water the poop was beaten gold , purple the sails , and so perfumed that the winds were with them , the oars were silver , which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made the water which they beat to follow faster , as amorous of their strokes .
for her own person , it beggar all description she did lie in her pavilion of tissue that venus where we see the fancy outwork nature on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling cupids , with fans , whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , and what they undid did .
o , rare for antony !
her gentlewomen , like the nereides , so many mermaids , tended her i ' the eyes , and made their bends adornings at the helm a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle swell with the touches of those hands , that yarely frame the office .
from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs .
the city cast her people out upon her , and antony , enthroned i ' the , did sit alone , whistling to the air , which , but for vacancy , had gone to gaze on cleopatra too , and made a gap in nature .
rare egyptian !
upon her landing , antony sent to her , invited her to supper she replied , it should be better he became her guest , which she entreated our courteous antony , whom the word of ' woman heard speak , being barber ten times , goes to the feast , and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only .
royal wench !
she made great caesar lay his sword to bed he plough her , and she cropp .
i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street , and having lost her breath , she spoke , and panted , that she did make defect perfection , and , breathless , power breathe forth .
now antony must leave her utterly .
never , he will not age can not wither her , nor custom stale her infinite variety other women cloy the appetites they feed but she makes hungry where most she satisfies , for vilest things become themselves in her that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish .
if beauty , wisdom , modesty , can settle the heart of antony , octavia is a blessed lottery to him .
let us go .

bid you alexas to mardian bring me word how tall she is .
pity me , charmian , but do not speak to me .
lead me to my chamber .
exeunt scene vi .
near misenum .
flourish .
enter pompey and menas at one door , with drum and trumpet at another , octavius caesar , mark antony , lepidus , domitius enobarbus , mecaenas , with soldiers marching your hostages i have , so have you mine , and we shall talk before we fight .
most meet that first we come to words , and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent , which , if thou hast consider , let us know if tie up thy discontented sword , and carry back to sicily much tall youth that else must perish here .
to you all three , the senators alone of this great world , chief factors for the gods , i do not know wherefore my father should revengers want , having a son and friends , since julius caesar , who at philippi the good brutus ghosted , there saw you labouring for him .
what that moved pale cassius to conspire , and what made the , honest roman , brutus , with the arm rest , courtiers and beauteous freedom , to drench the capitol , but that they would have one man but a man ?
and that is it hath made me rig my navy , at whose burthen the anger ocean foams , with which i meant to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful rome cast on my noble father .
take your time .
thou canst not fear us , pompey , with thy sails , we speak with thee at sea at land , thou how much we do thee .
at land , indeed , thou dost me of my father house but , since the cuckoo builds not for himself , remain i as thou mayst .
be pleased to tell us for this is from the present how you take the offers we have sent you .
there the point .
which do not be entreated to , but weigh what it is worth embraced .
and what may follow , to try a larger fortune .
you have made me offer of sicily , sardinia , and i must rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send measures of wheat to rome , this upon to part with unhack edges , and bear back our targes undinted .
that our offer .
know , then , i came before you here a man prepared to take this offer but mark antony put me to some impatience though i lose the praise of it by telling , you must know , when caesar and your brother were at blows , your mother came to sicily and did find her welcome friendly .
i have heard it , pompey , and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you .
let me have your hand i did not think , sir , to have met you here .
the beds i ' the east are soft , and thanks to you , that call me timelier than my purpose hither , for i have gain by .
since i saw you last , there is a change upon you .
well , i know not what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face , but in my bosom shall she never come , to make my heart her vassal .
well met here .
i hope so , lepidus .
thus we are agreed i crave our composition may be written , and seal between us .
that the next to do .
we feast each other ere we part , and let draw lots who shall begin .
that will i , pompey .
no , antony , take the lot but , first or last , your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame .
i have heard that julius caesar grew fat with feasting there .
you have heard much .
i have fair meanings , sir .
and fair words to them .
then so much have i heard and i have heard , apollodorus carried no more of that he did so .
what , i pray you ?
a certain queen to caesar in a mattress .
i know thee now how farest thou , soldier ?
well , and well am like to do , for , i perceive , four feasts are toward .
let me shake thy hand , i never hated thee i have seen thee fight , when i have envied thy behavior .
sir , i never loved you much , but i ha ' praised ye , when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did .
enjoy thy plainness , it nothing ill becomes thee .
aboard my galley i invite you all will you lead , lords ?
show us the way , sir .
come .
exeunt all but menas and enobarbus aside thy father , pompey , would have made this you and i have known , sir .
at sea , i think .
we have , sir .
you have done well by water .
and you by land .
i will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what i have done by land .
nor what i have done by water .
yes , something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea .
and you by land .
there i deny my land service .
but give me your hand , menas if our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
all men faces are true , their hands are .
but there is never a fair woman has a true face .
no slander , they steal hearts .
we came hither to fight with you .
for my part , i am sorry it is turned to a drinking .
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune .
if he do , sure , he can not back again .
you said , sir .
we looked not for mark antony here pray you , is he married to cleopatra ?
caesar sister is called octavia .
true , sir , she was the wife of caius marcellus .
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius .
pray ye , sir ?
is true .
then is caesar and he for ever knit together .
if i were bound to divine of this unity , i would not prophesy so .
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
i think so too .
but you shall find , the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
who would not have his wife so ?
not he that himself is not so , which is mark antony .
he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar , and , as i said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance .
antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here .
and thus it may be .
come , sir , will you aboard ?
i have a health for you .
i shall take it , sir we have used our throats in egypt .
come , let away .

music plays .
enter two or three servants with a banquet here they be , man .
some o ' their plants are already the least wind i ' the world will blow them down .
lepidus is .
they have made him drink .
as they pinch one another by the disposition , he cries out more , ' reconciles them to his entreaty , and himself to the drink .
but it raises the greater war between him and his discretion .
why , this is to have a name in great men fellowship i had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan i could not heave .
to be called into a huge sphere , and not to be seen to move i , are the holes where eyes should be , which pitifully disaster the cheeks .
a sennet sounded .
enter octavius caesar , mark antony , lepidus , pompey , agrippa , mecaenas , domitius enobarbus , menas , with other captains to octavius caesar thus do they , sir they take the flow o ' the nile by certain scales i ' the pyramid , they know , by the height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth or foison follow the higher nilus swells , the more it promises as it ebbs , the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , and shortly comes to harvest .
you strange serpents there .
ay , lepidus .
your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile .
they are so .
sit , and some wine !
a health to lepidus !
i am not so well as i should be , but i out .
not till you have slept , i fear me you be in till then .
nay , certainly , i have heard the ptolemies ' pyramises are very goodly things , without contradiction , i have heard that .
aside to pompey pompey , a word .
aside to menas say in mine ear what ?
aside to pompey forsake thy seat , i do beseech thee , captain , and hear me speak a word .
aside to menas forbear me till anon .
this wine for lepidus !
what manner o ' thing is your crocodile ?
it is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it , and the elements once out of it , it transmigrates .
what colour is it of ?
of it own colour too .
is a strange serpent .
is so .
and the tears of it are wet .
will this description satisfy him ?
with the health that pompey gives him , else he is a very epicure .
aside to menas go hang , sir , hang !
tell me of that ?
away !
do as i bid you .
where this cup i call for ?
aside to pompey if for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me , rise from thy stool .
aside to menas i think mad .
the matter ?
rises , and walks aside i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
thou hast served me with much faith .
what else to say ?
be jolly , lords .
these , lepidus , keep off them , for you sink .
wilt thou be lord of all the world ?
what thou ?
wilt thou be lord of the whole world ?
that twice .
how should that be ?
but entertain it , and , though thou think me poor , i am the man will give thee all the world .
hast thou drunk well ?
now , pompey , i have kept me from the cup .
thou art , if thou darest be , the earthly jove the ocean pales , or sky inclips , is thine , if thou wilt .
show me which way .
these three , these competitors , are in thy vessel let me cut the cable , and , when we are put off , fall to their throats all there is thine .
ah , this thou shouldst have done , and not have spoke o !
in me is villany , in had been good service .
thou must know , is not my profit that does lead mine honour , mine honour , it .
repent that thy tongue hath so betray thine act being done unknown , i should have found it afterwards well done , but must condemn it now .
desist , and drink .
aside for this , i never follow thy pall fortunes more .
who seeks , and will not take when once is offer , shall never find it more .
this health to lepidus !
bear him ashore .
i pledge it for him , pompey .
here to thee , menas !
enobarbus , welcome !
fill till the cup be hid .
there a strong fellow , menas .
pointing to the attendant who carries off lepidus why ?
a ' bears the third part of the world , man , not ?
the third part , then , is drunk would it were all , that it might go on wheels !
drink thou , increase the reels .
come .
this is not yet an alexandrian feast .
it ripens towards it .
strike the vessels , ho ?
here is to caesar !
i could well .
it monstrous labour , when i wash my brain , and it grows fouler .
be a child o ' the time .
possess it , i make answer but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one .
ha , my brave emperor !
to mark antony shall we dance now the egyptian bacchanals , and celebrate our drink ?
let , good soldier .
come , let all take hands , till that the conquering wine hath steep our sense in soft and delicate lethe .
all take hands .
make battery to our ears with the loud music the while i place you then the boy shall sing , the holding every man shall bear as loud as his strong sides can volley .
music plays .
domitius enobarbus places them hand in hand the song .
come , thou monarch of the vine , plumpy bacchus with pink eyne !
in thy fats our cares be drown , with thy grapes our hairs be crown cup us , till the world go round , cup us , till the world go round !
what would you more ?
pompey , good night .
good brother , let me request you off our graver business frowns at this levity .
gentle lords , let part , you see we have burnt our cheeks strong enobarb is weaker than the wine , and mine own tongue splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost antick us all .
what needs more words ?
good night .
good antony , your hand .
i try you on the shore .
and shall , sir , give your hand .
o antony , you have my father house , but , what ?
we are friends .
come , down into the boat .
take heed you fall not .

enter ventidius as it were in triumph , with silius , and other romans , officers , and soldiers , the dead body of pacorus borne before him now , darting parthia , art thou struck , and now pleased fortune does of marcus crassus ' death make me revenger .
bear the king son body before our army .
thy pacorus , orodes , pays this for marcus crassus .
noble ventidius , whilst yet with parthian blood thy sword is warm , the fugitive parthians follow , spur through media , mesopotamia , and the shelters whither the routed fly so thy grand captain antony shall set thee on triumphant chariots and put garlands on thy head .
o silius , silius , i have done enough , a lower place , note well , may make too great an act for learn this , silius , better to leave undone , than by our deed acquire too high a fame when him we serve away .
caesar and antony have ever won more in their officer than person sossius , one of my place in syria , his lieutenant , for quick accumulation of renown , which he achieved by the minute , lost his favour .
who does i ' the wars more than his captain can becomes his captain captain and ambition , the soldier virtue , rather makes choice of loss , than gain which darkens him .
i could do more to do antonius good , but offend him , and in his offence should my performance perish .
thou hast , ventidius , that without the which a soldier , and his sword , grants scarce distinction .
thou wilt write to antony !
i humbly signify what in his name , that magical word of war , we have effected , how , with his banners and his ranks , the horse of parthia we have jaded out o ' the field .
where is he now ?
he purposeth to athens whither , with what haste the weight we must convey with will permit , we shall appear before him .
on there , pass along !

they have dispatch with pompey , he is gone , the other three are sealing .
octavia weeps to part from rome , caesar is sad , and lepidus , since pompey feast , as menas says , is troubled with the green sickness .
is a noble lepidus .
a very fine one o , how he loves caesar !
nay , but how dearly he adores mark antony !
caesar ?
why , he the jupiter of men .
what antony ?
the god of jupiter .
spake you of caesar ?
how !
the !
o antony !
o thou arabian bird !
would you praise caesar , say ' go no further .
indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
but he loves caesar best , yet he loves antony ho !
hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not think , speak , cast , write , sing , number , ho !
his love to antony .
but as for caesar , kneel down , kneel down , and wonder .
both he loves .
they are his shards , and he their beetle .
trumpets within so , this is to horse .
adieu , noble agrippa .
good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
enter octavius caesar , mark antony , lepidus , and octavia no further , sir .
you take from me a great part of myself , use me well in .
sister , prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee , and as my farthest band shall pass on thy approof .
most noble antony , let not the piece of virtue , which is set betwixt us as the cement of our love , to keep it builded , be the ram to batter the fortress of it , for better might we have loved without this mean , if on both parts this be not cherish .
make me not offended in your distrust .
i have said .
you shall not find , though you be therein curious , the least cause for what you seem to fear so , the gods keep you , and make the hearts of romans serve your ends !
we will here part .
farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well the elements be kind to thee , and make thy spirits all of comfort !
fare thee well .
my noble brother !
the april in her eyes it is love spring , and these the showers to bring it on .
be cheerful .
sir , look well to my husband house , and what , octavia ?
i tell you in your ear .
her tongue will not obey her heart , nor can her heart inform her tongue , the swan , that stands upon the swell at full of tide , and neither way inclines .
aside to agrippa will caesar weep ?
aside to domitius enobarbus he has a cloud in face .
aside to agrippa he were the worse for that , were he a horse , so is he , being a man .
aside to domitius enobarbus why , enobarbus , when antony found julius caesar dead , he cried almost to roaring , and he wept when at philippi he found brutus slain .
aside to agrippa that year , indeed , he was troubled with a rheum , what willingly he did confound he wail , , till i wept too .
no , sweet octavia , you shall hear from me still , the time shall not my thinking on you .
come , sir , come , i wrestle with you in my strength of love look , here i have you , thus i let you go , and give you to the gods .
adieu , be happy !

farewell , fa rewell !

ay , dread queen .

she is not , madam .
didst hear her speak ?
is she or low ?
madam , i heard her speak , she is .
that not so good he can not like her long .
like her !
o isis !
is impossible .
i think so , charmian dull of tongue , and dwarfish !
what majesty is in her gait ?
remember , if thou on majesty .
she creeps her motion and her station are as one , she shows a body rather than a life , a statue than a breather .
is this certain ?
or i have no observance .
three in egypt can not make better note .
he very knowing , i do there nothing in her yet the fellow has good judgment .
excellent .
guess at her years , i prithee .
madam , she was a widow , widow !
charmian , hark .
and i do think she thirty .

thou must not take my former sharpness ill i will employ thee back again , i find thee most fit for business go make thee ready , our letters are prepared .

o my good lord , believe not all , or , if you must believe , stomach not all .
a more unhappy lady , if this division chance , stood between , praying for both parts the good gods me presently , when i shall pray , ' o bless my lord and husband ! '
undo that prayer , by crying out as loud , ' o , bless my brother ! '
husband win , win brother , prays , and destroys the prayer , no midway these extremes at all .
gentle octavia , let your best love draw to that point , which seeks best to preserve it if i lose mine honour , i lose myself better i were not yours than yours so branchless .
but , as you requested , yourself shall go between the mean time , lady , i raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother make your soonest haste , so your desires are yours .
thanks to my lord .
the jove of power make me most weak , most weak , your reconciler !
wars you twain would be as if the world should cleave , and that slain men should solder up the rift .
when it appears to you where this begins , turn your displeasure that way for our faults can never be so equal , that your love can equally move with them .

there strange news come , sir .
what , man ?
caesar and lepidus have made wars upon pompey .
this is old what is the success ?
caesar , having made use of him in the wars pompey , presently denied him rivality , would not let him partake in the glory of the action and not resting here , accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to pompey , upon his own appeal , seizes him so the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , and throw between them all the food thou hast , they grind the one the other .
where antony ?
he walking in the garden thus , and spurns the rush that lies before him , cries , lepidus ! '
and threats the throat of that his officer that murder pompey .

octavius caesar house .
enter octavius caesar , agrippa , and mecaenas contemning rome , he has done all this , and more , in alexandria here the manner of i ' the , on a tribunal silver , cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned at the feet sat caesarion , whom they call my father son , and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them .
unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt , made her of lower syria , cyprus , lydia , absolute queen .
this in the public eye ?
i ' the common , where they exercise .
his sons he there proclaim the kings of kings great media , parthia , and armenia .
he gave to alexander , to ptolemy he assign syria , cilicia , and phoenicia she in the habiliments of the goddess isis that day appear , and oft before gave audience , as is reported , so .
let rome be thus inform .
who , queasy with his insolence already , will their good thoughts call from him .
the people know it , and have now received his accusations .
who does he accuse ?
caesar and that , having in sicily sextus pompeius spoil , we had not rated him his part o ' the isle then does he say , he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly , he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed , and , being , that we detain all his revenue .
sir , this should be answer .
is done already , and the messenger gone .
i have told him , lepidus was grown too cruel , that he his high authority abused , and did deserve his change for what i have conquer , i grant him part , but then , in his armenia , and other of his conquer kingdoms , i demand the like .
he never yield to that .
nor must not then be yielded to in this .
enter octavia with her train hail , caesar , and my lord !
hail , most dear caesar !
that ever i should call thee castaway !
you have not call me so , nor have you cause .
why have you upon us thus !
you come not like caesar sister the wife of antony should have an army for an usher , and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear , the trees by the way should have borne men , and expectation fainted , longing for what it had not , nay , the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven , raised by your populous troops but you are come a to rome , and have prevented the ostentation of our love , which , left unshown , is often left unloved , we should have met you by sea and land , supplying every stage with an augmented greeting .
good my lord , to come thus was i not constrain , but did on my free will .
my lord , mark antony , hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted my grieved ear withal , whereon , i begg his pardon for return .
which soon he granted , being an obstruct his lust and him .
do not say so , my lord .
i have eyes upon him , and his affairs come to me on the wind .
where is he now ?
my lord , in athens .
no , my most wronged sister , cleopatra hath nodded him to her .
he hath given his empire up to a whore , who now are levying the kings o ' the earth for war , he hath assembled bocchus , the king of libya , archelaus , of cappadocia , philadelphos , king of paphlagonia , the thracian king , adallas , king malchus of arabia , king of pont , herod of jewry , mithridates , king of comagene , polemon and amyntas , the kings of mede and lycaonia , with a more larger list of sceptres .
ay me , most wretched , that have my heart parted betwixt two friends that do afflict each other !
welcome hither your letters did withhold our breaking forth , till we perceived , both how you were wrong led , and we in negligent danger .
cheer your heart , be you not troubled with the time , which drives your content these strong necessities , but let determined things to destiny hold unbewail their way .
welcome to rome , nothing more dear to me .
you are abused beyond the mark of thought and the high gods , to do you justice , make them ministers of us and those that love you .
best of comfort , and ever welcome to us .
welcome , lady .
welcome , dear madam .
each heart in rome does love and pity you only the adulterous antony , most large in his abominations , turns you off , and gives his potent regiment to a trull , that noises it against us .
is it so , sir ?
most certain .
sister , welcome pray you , be ever known to patience my sister !
exeunt scene vii .
near actium .
mark antony camp .
enter cleopatra and domitius enobarbus i will be even with thee , doubt it not .
but why , why , why ?
thou hast forspoke my being in these wars , and it is not fit .
well , is it , is it ?
if not denounced against us , why should not we be there in person ?
aside well , i could reply if we should serve with horse and mares together , the horse were merely lost , the mares would bear a soldier and his horse .
what you say ?
your presence needs must puzzle antony , take from his heart , take from his brain , from time , what should not then be spared .
he is already traduced for levity , and is said in rome that photinus an eunuch and your maids manage this war .
sink rome , and their tongues rot that speak against us !
a charge we bear i ' the war , and , as the president of my kingdom , will appear there for a man .
speak not against it i will not stay behind .
nay , i have done .
here comes the emperor .
enter mark antony and canidius is it not strange , canidius , that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea , and take in toryne ?
you have heard o , sweet ?
celerity is never more admired than by the negligent .
a good rebuke , which might have well becomed the best of men , to taunt at slackness .
canidius , we will fight with him by sea .
by sea !
what else ?
why will my lord do so ?
for that he dares us .
so hath my lord dared him to single fight .
ay , and to wage this battle at pharsalia .
where caesar fought with pompey but these offers , which serve not for his vantage , be shakes off , and so should you .
your ships are not well mann , your mariners are muleters , reapers , people ingross by swift impress , in caesar fleet are those that often have pompey fought their ships are yare , yours , heavy no disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea , being prepared for land .
by sea , by sea .
most worthy sir , you therein throw away the absolute soldiership you have by land , distract your army , which doth most consist of footmen , leave unexecuted your own renowned knowledge , quite forego the way which promises assurance , and give up yourself merely to chance and hazard , from firm security .
i fight at sea .
i have sixty sails , caesar none better .
our overplus of shipping will we burn , and , with the rest , from the head of actium beat the approaching caesar .
but if we fail , we then can at land .
enter a messenger thy business ?
the news is true , my lord , he is descried , caesar has taken toryne .
can he be there in person ?
is impossible , strange that power should be .
canidius , our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , and our twelve thousand horse .
we to our ship away , my thetis !
enter a soldier how now , worthy soldier ?
o noble emperor , do not fight by sea , trust not to rotten planks do you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds ?
let the egyptians and the phoenicians go , we have used to conquer , standing on the earth , and fighting foot to foot .
well , well away !
exeunt mark antony , queen cleopatra , and domitius enobarbus by hercules , i think i am i ' the right .
soldier , thou art but his whole action grows not in the power o so our leader led , and we are women men .
you keep by land the legions and the horse whole , do you not ?
marcus octavius , marcus justeius , publicola , and caelius , are for sea but we keep whole by land .
this speed of caesar carries beyond belief .
while he was yet in rome , his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies .
who his lieutenant , hear you ?
they say , one taurus .
well i know the man .
enter a messenger the emperor calls canidius .
with news the time with labour , and throes forth , each minute , some .

on our side like the token pestilence , where death is sure .
yon ribaudred nag of egypt , whom leprosy ! i ' the midst o ' the fight , when vantage like a pair of twins appear , both as the same , or rather ours the elder , the breese upon her , like a cow in june , hoists sails and flies .
that i beheld mine eyes did sicken at the sight , and could not endure a further view .
she once being loof , the noble ruin of her magic , antony , claps on his , and , like a doting mallard , leaving the fight in height , flies after her i never saw an action of such shame , experience , manhood , honour , before did violate so itself .
alack , alack !

why , then , good night indeed .
toward peloponnesus are they fled .

o , my pardon !
now i must to the young man send humble treaties , dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness , who with half the bulk o ' the world play as i pleased , making and marring fortunes .
you did know how much you were my conqueror , and that my sword , made weak by my affection , would obey it on all cause .
pardon , pardon !
fall not a tear , i say , one of them rates all that is won and lost give me a kiss , even this repays me .

enter euphronius , ambassador from mark antony approach , and speak .
such as i am , i come from antony i was of late as petty to his ends as is the on the to his grand sea .
so declare thine office .
lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and requires to live in egypt which not granted , he lessens his requests , and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth , a private man in athens this for him .
next , cleopatra does confess thy greatness , submits her to thy might , and of thee craves the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs , now hazarded to thy grace .
for antony , i have no ears to his request .
the queen of audience nor desire shall fail , so she from egypt drive her friend , or take his life there this if she perform , she shall not sue unheard .
so to them both .
fortune pursue thee !
bring him through the bands .
exit euphronius to thyreus from antony win cleopatra promise , and in our name , what she requires , add more , from thine invention , offers women are not in their best fortunes strong , but want will perjure the touch vestal try thy cunning , thyreus , make thine own edict for thy pains , which we will answer as a law .

think , and die .
is antony or we in fault for this ?
antony only , that would make his will lord of his reason .
what though you fled from that great face of war , whose several ranges frighted each other ?
why should he follow ?
the itch of his affection should not then have nick his captainship , at such a point , when half to half the world opposed , he being the meered question was a shame no less than was his loss , to course your flying flags , and leave his navy gazing .
prithee , peace .
enter mark antony with euphronius , the ambassador is that his answer ?
ay , my lord .
the queen shall then have courtesy , so she will yield us up .
he says so .
let her .
to the boy caesar send this grizzled head , and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities .
that head , my lord ?
to him again tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him , from which the world should note something particular his coin , ships , legions , may be a coward , whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i ' the command of caesar i dare him therefore to lay his gay comparisons apart , and answer me declined , sword against sword , ourselves alone .
i write it follow me .
exeunt mark antony and euphronius aside yes , like enough , caesar will unstate his happiness , and be staged to the show , against a sworder !
i see men judgments are a parcel of their fortunes , and things outward do draw the inward quality after them , to suffer all alike .
that he should dream , knowing all measures , the full caesar will answer his emptiness !
caesar , thou hast subdued his judgment too .
enter an attendant a messenger from caesar .
what , no more ceremony ?
see , my women !
against the blown rose may they stop their nose that kneel unto the buds .
admit him , sir .
exit attendant aside mine honesty and i begin to square .
the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i ' the story .
enter thyreus caesar will ?
hear it apart .
none but friends say boldly .
so , haply , are they friends to antony .
he needs as many , sir , as caesar has , or needs not us .
if caesar please , our master will leap to be his friend for us , you know , whose he is we are , and that is , caesar .
so .
thus then , thou most renown caesar entreats , not to consider in what case thou , further than he is caesar .
go on right royal .
he knows that you embrace not antony as you did love , but as you fear him .
o !
the scars upon your honour , therefore , he does pity , as constrained blemishes , not as deserved .
he is a god , and knows what is most right mine honour was not yielded , but conquer merely .
aside to be sure of that , i will ask antony .
sir , sir , thou art so leaky , that we must leave thee to thy sinking , for thy dearest quit thee .
exit shall i say to caesar what you require of him ?
for he partly begs to be desired to give .
it much would please him , that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon but it would warm his spirits , to hear from me you had left antony , and put yourself under his shrowd , the universal landlord .
what your name ?
my name is thyreus .
most kind messenger , say to great caesar this in deputation i kiss his conquering hand tell him , i am prompt to lay my crown at feet , and there to kneel tell him from his breath i hear the doom of egypt .
is your noblest course .
wisdom and fortune combating together , if that the former dare but what it can , no chance may shake it .
give me grace to lay my duty on your hand .
your caesar father oft , when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in , bestow his lips on that unworthy place , as it rain kisses .
mark antony and domitius enobarbus favours , by jove that thunders !
what art thou , fellow ?
one that but performs the bidding of the fullest man , and worthiest to have command obey .
aside you will be whipp .
approach , there !
ah , you kite !
now , gods and devils !
authority melts from me of late , when i cried ! '
like boys unto a muss , kings would start forth , and cry will ? '
have you no ears ?
i am antony yet .
enter attendants take hence this jack , and whip him .
aside is better playing with a lion whelp than with an old one dying .
moon and stars !
whip him .
twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge caesar , should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here , what her name , since she was cleopatra ?
whip him , fellows , till , like a boy , you see him cringe his face , and whine aloud for mercy take him hence .
mark antony !
tug him away being whipp , bring him again this jack of caesar shall bear us an errand to him .
exeunt attendants with thyreus you were half blasted ere i knew you ha !
have i my pillow left unpress in rome , forborne the getting of a lawful race , and by a gem of women , to be abused by one that looks on feeders ?
good my lord , you have been a boggler ever but when we in our viciousness grow hard o misery o ! the wise gods seel our eyes , in our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us adore our errors , laugh at , while we strut to our confusion .
o , come to this ?
i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar trencher , nay , you were a fragment of cneius pompey , besides what hotter hours , unregister in vulgar fame , you have luxuriously pick out for , i am sure , though you can guess what temperance should be , you know not what it is .
wherefore is this ?
to let a fellow that will take rewards and say quit you ! '
be familiar with my playfellow , your hand , this kingly seal and plighter of high hearts !
o , that i were upon the hill of basan , to outroar the horned herd !
for i have savage cause , and to proclaim it civilly , were like a halter neck which does the hangman thank for being yare about him .
attendants with thyreus is he whipp ?
soundly , my lord .
cried he ?
and begg a ' pardon ?
he did ask favour .
if that thy father live , let him repent thou wast not made his daughter , and be thou sorry to follow caesar in his triumph , since thou hast been whipp for following him henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee , shake thou to look on .
get thee back to caesar , tell him thy entertainment look , thou say he makes me angry with him , for he seems proud and disdainful , harping on what i am , not what he knew i was he makes me angry , and at this time most easy is to , when my good stars , that were my former guides , have empty left their orbs , and shot their fires into the abysm of hell .
if he mislike my speech and what is done , tell him he has hipparchus , my enfranched bondman , whom he may at pleasure whip , or hang , or torture , as he shall like , to quit me urge it thou hence with thy stripes , begone !
exit thyreus have you done yet ?
alack , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , and it portends alone the fall of antony !
i must stay his time .
to flatter caesar , would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points ?
not know me yet ?
toward me ?
ah , dear , if i be so , from my cold heart let heaven engender hail , and poison it in the source , and the first stone drop in my neck as it determines , so dissolve my life !
the next caesarion smite !
till by degrees the memory of my womb , together with my brave egyptians all , by the discandying of this pelleted storm , lie graveless , till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey !
i am satisfied .
caesar sits down in alexandria , where i will oppose his fate .
our force by land hath nobly held , our sever navy too have knit again , and fleet , threatening most .
where hast thou been , my heart ?
dost thou hear , lady ?
if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips , i will appear in blood , i and my sword will earn our chronicle there hope i yet .
that my brave lord !
i will be , hearted , breathed , and fight maliciously for when mine hours were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives of me for jests , but now i set my teeth , and send to darkness all that stop me .
come , let have one other gaudy night call to me all my sad captains , fill our bowls once more , let mock the midnight bell .
it is my i had thought to have held it poor but , since my lord is antony again , i will be cleopatra .
we will yet do well .
call all his noble captains to my lord .
do so , we speak to them , and i force the wine peep through their scars .
come on , my queen , there sap i yet .
the next time i do fight , i make death love me , for i will contend even with his pestilent scythe .
exeunt all but domitius enobarbus now he outstare the lightning .
to be furious , is to be frighted out of fear , and in that mood the dove will peck the estridge , and i see still , a diminution in our captain brain restores his heart when valour preys on reason , it eats the sword it fights with .
i will seek some way to leave him .

if thou please to take me to thee , as i was to him i be to caesar , if thou pleasest not , i yield thee up my life .
what thou ?
i say , o caesar , antony is dead .
the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack the round world should have shook lions into civil streets , and citizens to their dens the death of antony is not a single doom , in the name lay a moiety of the world .
he is dead , caesar not by a public minister of justice , nor by a hired knife , but that self hand , which writ his honour in the acts it did , hath , with the courage which the heart did lend it , splitted the heart .
this is his sword , i robb his wound of it , behold it stain with his most noble blood .
look you sad , friends ?
the gods rebuke me , but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings .
and strange it is , that nature must compel us to lament our most persisted deeds .
his taints and honours waged equal with him .
a rarer spirit never did steer humanity but you , gods , will give us some faults to make us men .
caesar is touch .
when such a spacious mirror set before him , he needs must see himself .
o antony !
i have follow thee to this , but we do lance diseases in our bodies i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day , or look on thine , we could not stall together in the whole world but yet let me lament , with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts , that thou , my brother , my competitor in top of all design , my mate in empire , friend and companion in the front of war , the arm of mine own body , and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindle , that our stars , unreconciliable , should divide our equalness to this .

is paltry to be caesar , not being fortune , he but fortune knave , a minister of her will and it is great to do that thing that ends all other deeds , which shackles accidents and bolts up change , which sleeps , and never palates more the dug , the beggar nurse and caesar .
enter , to the gates of the monument , proculeius , gallus and soldiers caesar sends greeting to the queen of egypt , and bids thee study on what fair demands thou to have him grant thee .
what thy name ?
my name is proculeius .
antony did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but i do not greatly care to be deceived , that have no use for trusting .
if your master would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , that majesty , to keep decorum , must no less beg than a kingdom if he please to give me conquer egypt for my son , he gives me so much of mine own , as i will kneel to him with thanks .
be of good cheer , you into a princely hand , fear nothing make your full reference freely to my lord , who is so full of grace , that it flows over on all that need let me report to him your sweet dependency , and you shall find a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness , where he for grace is kneel to .
pray you , tell him i am his fortune vassal , and i send him the greatness he has got .
i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience , and would gladly look him i ' the face .
this i report , dear lady .

know , sir , that i will not wait pinion at your master court , nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull octavia .
shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring rome ?
rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me !
rather on nilus ' mud lay me stark naked , and let the blow me into abhorring !
rather make my country high pyramides my gibbet , and hang me up in chains !
you do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in caesar .
enter dolabella proculeius , what thou hast done thy master caesar knows , and he hath sent for thee for the queen , i take her to my guard .
so , dolabella , it shall content me best be gentle to her .

exeunt proculeius and soldiers most noble empress , you have heard of me ?
i can not tell .
assuredly you know me .
no matter , sir , what i have heard or known .
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams , not your trick ?
i understand not , madam .
i dream there was an emperor antony o , such another sleep , that i might see but such another man !
if it might please ye , his face was as the heavens , and therein stuck a sun and moon , which kept their course , and lighted the little o , the earth .
most sovereign creature , his legs bestrid the ocean his rear arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres , and that to friends , but when he meant to quail and shake the orb , he was as rattling thunder .
for his bounty , there was no winter i , an autumn was that grew the more by reaping his delights were , they show his back above the element they lived in in his livery walk crowns and crownets , realms and islands were as plates dropp from his pocket .
cleopatra !
think you there was , or might be , such a man as this i dream of ?
gentle madam , no .
you lie , up to the hearing of the gods .
but , if there be , or ever were , one such , it past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy , yet , to imagine and antony , were nature piece fancy , condemning shadows quite .
hear me , good madam .
your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it as answering to the weight would i might never pursued success , but i do feel , by the rebound of yours , a grief that smites my very heart at root .
i thank you , sir , know you what caesar means to do with me ?
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew .
nay , pray you , sir , though he be honourable , he lead me , then , in triumph ?

sir , the gods will have it thus , my master and my lord i must obey .
take to you no hard thoughts the record of what injuries you did us , though written in our flesh , we shall remember as things but done by chance .
sole sir o ' the world , i can not project mine own cause so well to make it clear , but do confess i have been laden with like frailties which before have often shamed our sex .
cleopatra , know , we will extenuate rather than enforce if you apply yourself to our intents , which towards you are most gentle , you shall find a benefit in this change , but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty , by taking antony course , you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes , and put your children to that destruction which i guard them from , if thereon you rely .
i take my leave .
and may , through all the world is yours , and we , your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall hang in what place you please .

this is my treasurer let him speak , my lord , upon his peril , that i have reserved to myself nothing .
speak the truth , seleucus .
madam , i had rather seal my lips , than , to my peril , speak that which is not .
what have i kept back ?
enough to purchase what you have made known .
nay , blush not , cleopatra , i approve your wisdom in the deed .
see , caesar !
o , behold , how pomp is follow !
mine will now be yours , and , should we shift estates , yours would be mine .
the ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild o slave , of no more trust than love that hired !
what , goest thou back ?
thou shalt go back , i warrant thee , but i catch thine eyes , though they had wings slave , soulless villain , dog !
o rarely base !
good queen , let us entreat you .
o caesar , what a wounding shame is this , that thou , vouchsafing here to visit me , doing the honour of thy lordliness to one so meek , that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy !
say , good caesar , that i some lady trifles have reserved , immoment toys , things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal , and say , some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia , to induce their mediation , must i be unfolded with one that i have bred ?
the gods !
it smites me beneath the fall i have .
to seleucus prithee , go hence , or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man , thou wouldst have mercy on me .
forbear , seleucus .
exit seleucus be it known , that we , the greatest , are misthought for things that others do , and , when we fall , we answer others ' merits in our name , are therefore to be pitied .
cleopatra , not what you have reserved , nor what acknowledged , put we i ' the roll of conquest still yours , bestow it at your pleasure , and believe , caesar no merchant , to make prize with you of things that merchants sold .
therefore be cheer , make not your thoughts your prisons no , dear queen , for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel .

avoid , and leave him .
exit guardsman hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there , that kills and pains not ?
truly , i have him but i would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal , those that do die of it do seldom or never recover .
rememberest thou any that have died o ?
very many , men and women too .
i heard of one of them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman , but something given to lie , as a woman should not do , but in the way of honesty how she died of the biting of it , what pain she felt truly , she makes a very good report o ' the worm , but he that will believe all that they say , shall never be saved by half that they do but this is most fallible , the worm an odd worm .
get thee hence , farewell .
i wish you all joy of the worm .
setting down his basket farewell .
you must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
ay , ay , farewell .
look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for , indeed , there is no goodness in worm .
take thou no care , it shall be heeded .
very good .
give it nothing , i pray you , for it is not worth the feeding .
will it eat me ?
you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself will not eat a woman i know that a woman is a dish for the gods , if the devil dress her not .
but , truly , these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women , for in every ten that they make , the devils mar five .
well , get thee gone , farewell .
yes , forsooth i wish you joy o ' the worm .

dost thou lie still ?
if thus thou vanishest , thou the world it is not worth .
dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that i may say , the gods themselves do weep !

within ' a way there , a way for caesar ! '
octavius caesar and all his train marching o sir , you are too sure an augurer , that you did fear is done .
bravest at the last , she levell at our purposes , and , being royal , took her own way .
the manner of their deaths ?
i do not see them bleed .
who was last with them ?
a simple countryman , that brought her figs this was his basket .
poison , then .
o caesar , this charmian lived but now , she stood and spake i found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress , tremblingly she stood and on the sudden dropp .
o noble weakness !
if they had swallow poison , appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep , as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace .
here , on her breast , there is a vent of blood and something blown the like is on her arm .
this is an aspic trail and these have slime upon them , such as the aspic leaves upon the caves of nile .
most probable that so she died , for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die .
take up her bed , and bear her women from the monument she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous .
high events as these strike those that make them , and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented .
our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral , and then to rome .
come , dolabella , see high order in this great solemnity .
exeunt act i scene i .
a hall in duke solinus palace .
enter duke solinus , aegeon , gaoler , officers , and other attendants proceed , solinus , to procure my fall and by the doom of death end woes and all .
merchant of syracuse , plead no more , i am not partial to infringe our laws the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants , our countrymen , who wanting guilders to redeem their lives have seal his rigorous statutes with their bloods , excludes all pity from our threatening looks .
for , since the mortal and intestine jars thy seditious countrymen and us , it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves , to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay , more , if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs , again if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus , he dies , his goods confiscate to the duke dispose , unless a thousand marks be levied , to quit the penalty and to ransom him .
thy substance , valued at the highest rate , can not amount unto a hundred marks , therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
yet this my comfort when your words are done , my woes end likewise with the evening sun .
well , syracusian , say in brief the cause why thou from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus .
a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet , that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature , not by vile offence , i utter what my sorrows give me leave .
in syracusa was i born , and wed unto a woman , happy but for me , and by me , had not our hap been bad .
with her i lived in joy , our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum , till my factor death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself , almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear , had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was .
there had she not been long , but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons , and , which was strange , the one so like the other , as could not be distinguish but by names .
that very hour , and in the inn , a meaner woman was delivered of such a burden , male twins , both alike those , for their parents were exceeding poor , i bought and brought up to attend my sons .
my wife , not meanly proud of two such boys , made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed .
alas !
too soon , we came aboard .
a league from epidamnum had we sail , before the always deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope , for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death , which though myself would gladly have embraced , yet the incessant weepings of my wife , weeping before for what she saw must come , and piteous plainings of the pretty babes , that mourn for fashion , ignorant what to fear , forced me to seek delays for them and me .
and this it was , for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat , and left the ship , then , to us my wife , more careful for the , had fasten him unto a small spare mast , such as seafaring men provide for storms , to him one of the other twins was bound , whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed , my wife and i , fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix , fasten ourselves at either end the mast , and floating straight , obedient to the stream , was carried towards corinth , as we thought .
at length the sun , gazing upon the earth , dispersed those vapours that offended us , and by the benefit of his wished light , the seas wax calm , and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us , of corinth that , of epidaurus this but ere they came , o , let me say no more !
gather the sequel by that went before .
nay , forward , old man , do not break off so , for we may pity , though not pardon thee .
o , had the gods done so , i had not now worthily term them merciless to us !
for , ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues , we were encounterd by a mighty rock , which being violently borne upon , our helpful ship was splitted in the midst , so that , in this unjust divorce of us , fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in , what to sorrow for .
her part , poor soul !
seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe , was carried with more speed before the wind , and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth , as we thought .
at length , another ship had seized on us , and , knowing whom it was their hap to save , gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck guests , and would have reft the fishers of their prey , had not their bark been very slow of sail , and therefore homeward did they bend their course .
thus have you heard me sever from my bliss , that by misfortunes was my life prolong , to tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for , do me the favour to dilate at full what hath of them and thee till now .
my youngest boy , and yet my eldest care , at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendant so his case was like , reft of his brother , but retain his name might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i labour of a love to see , i hazarded the loss of whom i loved .
five summers have i spent in furthest greece , roaming clean through the bounds of asia , and , coasting homeward , came to ephesus , hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men .
but here must end the story of my life , and happy were i in my timely death , could all my travels warrant me they live .
hapless aegeon , whom the fates have mark to bear the extremity of dire mishap !
now , trust me , were it not against our laws , against my crown , my oath , my dignity , which princes , would they , may not disannul , my soul would sue as advocate for thee .
but , though thou art adjudged to the death and passed sentence may not be recall but to our honour great disparagement , yet i will favour thee in what i can .
therefore , merchant , i limit thee this day to seek thy life by beneficial help try all the friends thou hast in ephesus , beg thou , or borrow , to make up the sum , and live , if no , then thou art doom to die .
gaoler , take him to thy custody .
i will , my lord .
hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend , but to procrastinate his lifeless end .
exeunt scene ii .
the mart .
enter antipholus of syracuse , dromio of syracuse , and first merchant therefore give out you are of epidamnum , lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .
this very day a syracusian merchant is apprehended for arrival here , and not being able to buy out his life according to the statute of the town , dies ere the weary sun set in the west .
there is your money that i had to keep .
antipholus go bear it to the centaur , where we host , and stay there , dromio , till i come to thee .
within this hour it will be till that , i view the manners of the town , peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , and then return and sleep within mine inn , for with long travel i am stiff and weary .
get thee away .
many a man would take you at your word , and go indeed , having so good a mean .
exit antipholus a trusty villain , sir , that very oft , when i am dull with care and melancholy , lightens my humour with his merry jests .
what , will you walk with me about the town , and then go to my inn and dine with me ?
i am invited , sir , to certain merchants , of whom i hope to make much benefit , i crave your pardon .
soon at five , please you , i meet with you upon the mart and afterward consort you till my present business calls me from you now .
antipholus farewell till then i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city .
sir , i commend you to your own content .
exit antipholus he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i can not get .
i to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop , who , falling there to find his fellow forth , unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself so i , to find a mother and a brother , in quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .
enter dromio of ephesus here comes the almanac of my true date .
what now ?
how chance thou art return so soon ?
return so soon !
rather approach too late the capon burns , the pig falls from the spit , the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell , my mistress made it one upon my cheek she is so hot because the meat is cold , the meat is cold because you come not home , you come not home because you have no stomach , you have no stomach having broke your fast , but we that know what is to fast and pray are penitent for your default .
antipholus stop in your wind , sir tell me this , i pray where have you left the money that i gave you ?
o , sixpence , that i had o ' wednesday last to pay the saddler for my mistress ' crupper ?
the saddler had it , sir , i kept it not .
antipholus i am not in a sportive humour now tell me , and dally not , where is the money ?
we being strangers here , how darest thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody ?
i pray you , air , as you sit at dinner i from my mistress come to you in post , if i return , i shall be post indeed , for she will score your fault upon my pate .
methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , and strike you home without a messenger .
antipholus come , dromio , come , these jests are out of season , reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
where is the gold i gave in charge to thee ?
to me , sir ?
why , you gave no gold to me .
antipholus come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
my charge was but to fetch you from the mart home to your house , the phoenix , sir , to dinner my mistress and her sister stays for you .
antipholus in what safe place you have bestow my money , or i shall break that merry sconce of yours that stands on tricks when i am undisposed where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?
i have some marks of yours upon my pate , some of my mistress ' marks upon my shoulders , but not a thousand marks between you both .
if i should pay your worship those again , perchance you will not bear them patiently .
antipholus thy mistress ' marks ?
what mistress , slave , hast thou ?
your worship wife , my mistress at the phoenix , she that doth fast till you come home to dinner , and prays that you will hie you home to dinner .
antipholus what , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , being forbid ?
there , take you that , sir knave .
what mean you , sir ?
for god sake , hold your hands !
nay , and you will not , sir , i take my heels .
exit antipholus upon my life , by some device or other the villain is of all my money .
they say this town is full of cozenage , as , nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , sorcerers that change the mind , witches that deform the body , disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , and many liberties of sin if it prove so , i will be gone the sooner .
i to the centaur , to go seek this slave i greatly fear my money is not safe .
exit act ii scene i .
the house of antipholus of ephesus .
enter adriana and luciana neither my husband nor the slave return , that in such haste i sent to seek his master !
sure , luciana , it is two .
perhaps some merchant hath invited him , and from the mart he somewhere gone to dinner .
good sister , let us dine and never fret a man is master of his liberty time is their master , and , when they see time , they go or come if so , be patient , sister .
why should their liberty than ours be more ?
because their business still lies out o ' door .
look , when i serve him so , he takes it o , know he is the bridle of your will .
there none but asses will be bridled so .
why , headstrong liberty is lash with woe .
there nothing situate under heaven eye but hath his bound , in earth , in sea , in sky the beasts , the fishes , and the winged fowls , are their males ' subjects and at their controls men , more divine , the masters of all these , lords of the wide world and wild watery seas , indued with intellectual sense and souls , of more preeminence than fish and fowls , are masters to their females , and their lords then let your will attend on their accords .
this servitude makes you to keep unwed .
not this , but troubles of the .
but , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
ere i learn love , i practise to obey .
how if your husband start some other where ?
till he come home again , i would forbear .
patience unmoved !
no marvel though she pause , they can be meek that have no other cause .
a wretched soul , bruised with adversity , we bid be quiet when we hear it cry , but were we burdened with like weight of pain , as much or more would we ourselves complain so thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me , but , if thou live to see like right bereft , this patience in thee will be left .
well , i will marry one day , but to try .
here comes your man , now is your husband nigh .
enter dromio of ephesus say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
nay , he at two hands with me , and that my two ears can witness .
say , didst thou speak with him ?
thou his mind ?
ay , ay , he told his mind upon mine ear beshrew his hand , i scarce could understand it .
spake he so doubtfully , thou couldst not feel his meaning ?
nay , he struck so plainly , i could too well feel his blows , and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce understand them .
but say , i prithee , is he coming home ?
it seems he hath great care to please his wife .
why , mistress , sure my master is .
, thou villain !
i mean not , but , sure , he is stark mad .
when i desired him to come home to dinner , he ask me for a thousand marks in gold , ' quoth i , gold ! '
quoth he , meat doth burn , ' quoth i , gold ! '
quoth he you come home ? '
quoth i , gold ! '
quoth he .
is the thousand marks i gave thee , villain ? '
pig , ' quoth i , burn , ' gold ! '
quoth he mistress , sir ' quoth i , up thy mistress !
i know not thy mistress , out on thy mistress ! '
quoth who ?
quoth my master ' i know , ' quoth he , house , no wife , no mistress . '
so that my errand , due unto my tongue , i thank him , i bare home upon my shoulders , for , in conclusion , he did beat me there .
go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
go back again , and be new beaten home ?
for god sake , send some other messenger .
back , slave , or i will break thy pate across .
and he will bless that cross with other beating between you i shall have a holy head .
hence , prating peasant !
fetch thy master home .
am i so round with you as you with me , that like a football you do spurn me thus ?
you spurn me hence , and he will spurn me hither if i last in this service , you must case me in leather .
exit fie , how impatience loureth in your face !
his company must do his minions grace , whilst i at home starve for a merry look .
hath homely age the alluring beauty took from my poor cheek ?
then he hath wasted it are my discourses dull ?
barren my wit ?
if voluble and sharp discourse be marr , unkindness blunts it more than marble hard do their gay vestments his affections bait ?
that not my fault he master of my state what ruins are in me that can be found , by him not ruin ?
then is he the ground of my defeatures .
my decayed fair a sunny look of his would soon repair but , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale and feeds from home , poor i am but his stale .
jealousy !
fie , beat it hence !
unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense .
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere , or else what lets it but he would be here ?
sister , you know he promised me a chain , would that alone , alone he would detain , so he would keep fair quarter with his bed !
i see the jewel best enamelled will lose his beauty , yet the gold bides still , that others touch , and often touching will wear gold and no man that hath a name , by falsehood and corruption doth it shame .
since that my beauty can not please his eye , i weep what left away , and weeping die .
how many fond fools serve mad jealousy !
exeunt scene ii .
a public place .
enter antipholus of syracuse antipholus the gold i gave to dromio is laid up safe at the centaur , and the heedful slave is wander forth , in care to seek me out by computation and mine host report .
i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart .
see , here he comes .
enter dromio of syracuse how now sir !
is your merry humour alter ?
as you love strokes , so jest with me again .
you know no centaur ?
you received no gold ?
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner ?
my house was at the phoenix ?
wast thou mad , that thus so madly thou didst answer me ?
what answer , sir ?
when spake i such a word ?
antipholus even now , even here , not half an hour since .
i did not see you since you sent me hence , home to the centaur , with the gold you gave me .
antipholus villain , thou didst deny the gold receipt , and me of a mistress and a dinner , for which , i hope , thou i was displeased .
i am glad to see you in this merry vein what means this jest ?
i pray you , master , tell me .
antipholus yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
thou i jest ?
hold , take thou that , and that .
beating him hold , sir , for god sake !
now your jest is earnest upon what bargain do you give it me ?
antipholus because that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you , your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours .
when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport , but creep in crannies when he hides his beams .
if you will jest with me , know my aspect , and fashion your demeanor to my looks , or i will beat this method in your sconce .
sconce call you it ?
so you would leave battering , i had rather have it a head an you use these blows long , i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too , or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders .
but , i pray , sir why am i beaten ?
antipholus dost thou not know ?
nothing , sir , but that i am beaten .
antipholus shall i tell you why ?
ay , sir , and wherefore , for they say every why hath a wherefore .
antipholus why , first , for flouting me , and then , wherefore for urging it the second time to me .
was there ever any man thus beaten out of season , when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason ?
well , sir , i thank you .
antipholus thank me , sir , for what ?
marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .
antipholus i make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .
but say , sir , is it ?
no , sir , i think the meat wants that i have .
antipholus in good time , sir , what that ?
basting .
antipholus well , sir , then be dry .
if it be , sir , i pray you , eat none of it .
antipholus your reason ?
lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
antipholus well , sir , learn to jest in good time there a time for all things .
i durst have denied that , before you were so choleric .
antipholus by what rule , sir ?
marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself .
antipholus let hear it .
there no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
antipholus may he not do it by fine and recovery ?
yes , to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man .
antipholus why is time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?
because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts , and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit .
antipholus why , but there many a man hath more hair than wit .
not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair .
antipholus why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
the plainer dealer , the sooner lost yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity .
antipholus for what reason ?
for two , and sound ones too .
antipholus nay , not sound , i pray you .
sure ones , then .
antipholus nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
certain ones then .
antipholus name them .
the one , to save the money that he spends in trimming , the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .
antipholus you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
marry , and did , sir , namely , no time to recover hair lost by nature .
antipholus but your reason was not substantial , why there is no time to recover .
thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore to the world end will have bald followers .
antipholus i knew be a bald conclusion but , soft !
who wafts us yonder ?
enter adriana and luciana ay , ay , antipholus , look strange and frown some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects , i am not adriana nor thy wife .
the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear , that never object pleasing in thine eye , that never touch well welcome to thy hand , that never meat in thy taste , unless i spake , or look , or touch , or carved to thee .
how comes it now , my husband , o , how comes it , that thou art thus estranged from thyself ?
thyself i call it , being strange to me , that , undividable , incorporate , am better than thy dear self better part .
ah , do not tear away thyself from me !
for know , my love , as easy mayest thou fall a drop of water in the breaking gulf , and take unmingled that same drop again , without addition or diminishing , as take from me thyself and not me too .
how dearly would it touch me to the quick , shouldst thou but hear i were licentious and that this body , consecrate to thee , by ruffian lust should be contaminate !
wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me and hurl the name of husband in my face and tear the stain skin off my and from my false hand cut the and break it with a vow ?
i know thou canst , and therefore see thou do it .
i am possess with an adulterate blot , my blood is mingled with the crime of lust for if we too be one and thou play false , i do digest the poison of thy flesh , being strumpeted by thy contagion .
keep then far league and truce with thy true bed , i live unstain , thou undishonoured .
antipholus plead you to me , fair dame ?
i know you not in ephesus i am but two hours old , as strange unto your town as to your talk , who , every word by all my wit being scann , want wit in all one word to understand .
fie , brother !
how the world is changed with you !
when were you wont to use my sister thus ?
she sent for you by dromio home to dinner .
antipholus by dromio ?
by me ?
by thee , and this thou didst return from him , that he did buffet thee , and , in his blows , denied my house for his , me for his wife .
antipholus did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?
what is the course and drift of your compact ?
i , sir ?
i never saw her till this time .
antipholus villain , thou liest , for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
i never spake with her in all my life .
antipholus how can she thus then call us by our names , unless it be by inspiration .
how ill agrees it with your gravity to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave , abetting him to thwart me in my mood !
be it my wrong you are from me exempt , but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt .
come , i will fasten on this sleeve of thine thou art an elm , my husband , i a vine , whose weakness , married to thy stronger state , makes me with thy strength to communicate if aught possess thee from me , it is dross , usurping ivy , brier , or idle moss , who , all for want of pruning , with intrusion infect thy sap and live on thy confusion .
antipholus to me she speaks , she moves me for her theme what , was i married to her in my dream ?
or sleep i now and think i hear all this ?
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?
until i know this sure uncertainty , i entertain the offer fallacy .
dromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
o , for my beads !
i cross me for a sinner .
this is the fairy land o spite of spites !
we talk with goblins , owls and sprites if we obey them not , this will ensue , they suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .
why pratest thou to thyself and not ?
dromio , thou drone , thou snail , thou slug , thou sot !
i am transformed , master , am i not ?
antipholus i think thou art in mind , and so am i .
nay , master , both in mind and in my shape .
antipholus thou hast thine own form .
no , i am an ape .
if thou art changed to aught , is to an ass .
is true , she rides me and i long for grass .
is so , i am an ass , else it could never be but i should know her as well as she knows me .
come , come , no longer will i be a fool , to put the finger in the eye and weep , whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn .
come , sir , to dinner .
dromio , keep the gate .
husband , i dine above with you and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .
sirrah , if any ask you for your master , say he dines forth , and let no creature enter .
come , sister .
dromio , play the porter well .
antipholus am i in earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
sleeping or waking ?
mad or ?
known unto these , and to myself disguised !
i say as they say and persever so , and in this mist at all adventures go .
master , shall i be porter at the gate ?
ay , and let none enter , lest i break your pate .
come , come , antipholus , we dine too late .

but here a villain that would face me down he met me on the mart , and that i beat him , and charged him with a thousand marks in gold , and that i did deny my wife and house .
thou drunkard , thou , what didst thou mean by this ?
say what you will , sir , but i know what i know , that you beat me at the mart , i have your hand to show if the skin were parchment , and the blows you gave were ink , your own handwriting would tell you what i think .
antipholus i think thou art an ass .
marry , so it doth appear by the wrongs i suffer and the blows i bear .
i should kick , being kick , and , being at that pass , you would keep from my heels and beware of an ass .
antipholus you sad , signior balthazar pray god our cheer may answer my good will and your good welcome here .
i hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
antipholus o , signior balthazar , either at flesh or fish , a table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish .
good meat , sir , is common , that every churl affords .
antipholus and welcome more common , for that nothing but words .
small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
antipholus ay , to a niggardly host , and more sparing guest but though my cates be mean , take them in good part , better cheer may you have , but not with better heart .

antipholus what art thou that keepest me out from the house i owe ?
within the porter for this time , sir , and my name is dromio .
o villain !
thou hast stolen both mine office and my name .
the one got me credit , the other mickle blame .
if thou hadst been dromio in my place , thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy name for an ass .
within what a coil is there , dromio ?
who are those at the gate ?
let my master in , luce .
within faith , no , he comes too late , and so tell your master .

master , knock the door hard .
within let him knock till it ache .
antipholus you cry for this , minion , if i beat the door down .
within what needs all that , and a pair of stocks in the town ?

antipholus are you there , wife ?

if you went in pain , master , this ' would go sore .
here is neither cheer , sir , nor welcome we would fain have either .
in debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
they stand at the door , master , bid them welcome hither .
antipholus there is something in the wind , that we can not get in .

be ruled by me depart in patience , and let us to the tiger all to dinner , and about evening come yourself alone to know the reason of this strange restraint .
if by strong hand you offer to break in now in the stirring passage of the day , a vulgar comment will be made of it , and that supposed by the common rout against your yet ungalled estimation that may with foul intrusion enter in and dwell upon your grave when you are dead , for slander lives upon succession , for ever housed where it gets possession .
antipholus you have prevailed i will depart in quiet , and , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .

enter adriana and luciana ah , luciana , did he tempt thee so ?
mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye that he did plead in earnest ?
yea or no ?
look he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ?
what observation madest thou in this case of his heart meteors tilting in his face ?
first he denied you had in him no right .
he meant he did me none , the more my spite .
then swore he that he was a stranger here .
and true he swore , though yet forsworn he were .
then pleaded i for you .
and what said he ?
that love i begg for you he begg of me .
with what persuasion did he tempt thy love ?
with words that in an honest suit might move .
first he did praise my beauty , then my speech .
didst speak him fair ?
have patience , i beseech .
i can not , nor i will not , hold me still , my tongue , though not my heart , shall have his will .
he is deformed , crooked , old and sere , , worse bodied , shapeless everywhere , vicious , ungentle , foolish , blunt , unkind , stigmatical in making , worse in mind .
who would be jealous then of such a one ?
no evil lost is wail when it is gone .
ah , but i think him better than i say , and yet would herein others ' eyes were worse .
far from her nest the lapwing cries away my heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .
enter dromio of syracuse here !
go , the desk , the purse !
sweet , now , make haste .
how hast thou lost thy breath ?
by running fast .
where is thy master , dromio ?
is he well ?
no , he in tartar limbo , worse than hell .
a devil in an everlasting garment hath him , one whose hard heart is button up with steel , a fiend , a fury , pitiless and rough , a wolf , nay , worse , a fellow all in buff , a , a , one that countermands the passages of alleys , creeks and narrow lands , a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well , one that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell .
why , man , what is the matter ?
i do not know the matter he is on the case .
what , is he arrested ?
tell me at whose suit .
i know not at whose suit he is arrested well , but he in a suit of buff which him , that can i tell .
will you send him , mistress , redemption , the money in his desk ?
go fetch it , sister .
exit luciana this i wonder at , that he , unknown to me , should be in debt .
tell me , was he arrested on a band ?
not on a band , but on a stronger thing , a chain , a chain !
do you not hear it ring ?
what , the chain ?
no , no , the bell is time that i were gone it was two ere i left him , and now the clock strikes one .
the hours come back !
that did i never hear .
o , yes , if any hour meet a sergeant , a ' turns back for very fear .
as if time were in debt !
how fondly dost thou reason !
time is a very bankrupt , and owes more than he worth , to season .
nay , he a thief too have you not heard men say that time comes stealing on by night and day ?
if time be in debt and theft , and a sergeant in the way , hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day ?

exeunt scene iii .
a public place .
enter antipholus of syracuse antipholus there not a man i meet but doth salute me as if i were their friend , and every one doth call me by my name .
some tender money to me , some invite me , some other give me thanks for kindnesses , some offer me commodities to buy even now a tailor call me in his shop and show me silks that he had bought for me , and therewithal took measure of my body .
sure , these are but imaginary wiles and lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
enter dromio of syracuse master , here the gold you sent me for .
what , have you got the picture of old adam ?
antipholus what gold is this ?
what adam dost thou mean ?
not that adam that kept the paradise but that adam that keeps the prison he that goes in the calf skin that was killed for the prodigal , he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty .
antipholus i understand thee not .
no ?
why , is a plain case he that went , like a , in a case of leather , the man , sir , that , when gentlemen are tired , gives them a sob and them , he , sir , that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance , he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a .
antipholus what , thou meanest an officer ?
ay , sir , the sergeant of the band , he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band , one that thinks a man always going to bed , and says , give you good rest ! '
antipholus well , sir , there rest in your foolery .
is there any why , sir , i brought you word an hour since that the bark expedition put forth , and then were you hindered by the sergeant , to tarry for the hoy delay .
here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you .
antipholus the fellow is distract , and so am i , and here we wander in illusions some blessed power deliver us from hence !
enter a courtezan well met , well met , master antipholus .
i see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now is that the chain you promised me ?
antipholus satan , avoid !
i charge thee , tempt me not .
master , is this mistress satan ?
antipholus it is the devil .
nay , she is worse , she is the devil dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench and thereof comes that the wenches say damn me , ' that as much to say make me a light wench . '
it is written , they appear to men like angels of light light is an effect of fire , and fire will burn , ergo , light wenches will burn .
come not near her .
your man and you are marvellous merry , sir .
will you go with me ?
we mend our dinner here ?
master , if you do , expect , or bespeak a long spoon .
antipholus why , dromio ?
marry , he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil .
antipholus avoid then , fiend !
what thou me of supping ?
thou art , as you are all , a sorceress i conjure thee to leave me and be gone .
give me the ring of mine you had at dinner , or , for my diamond , the chain you promised , and i be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
some devils ask but the parings of one nail , a rush , a hair , a drop of blood , a pin , a nut , a , but she , more covetous , would have a chain .
master , be wise an if you give it her , the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it .
i pray you , sir , my ring , or else the chain i hope you do not mean to cheat me so .
antipholus avaunt , thou witch !
come , dromio , let us go .
pride , ' says the peacock mistress , that you know .
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse now , out of doubt antipholus is mad , else would he never so demean himself .
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , and for the same he promised me a chain both one and other he denies me now .
the reason that i gather he is mad , besides this present instance of his rage , is a mad tale he told at dinner , of his own doors being shut against his entrance .
belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , on purpose shut the doors against his way .
my way is now to hie home to his house , and tell his wife that , being lunatic , he rush into my house and took perforce my ring away .
this course i fittest choose , for forty ducats is too much to lose .
exit scene iv .
a street .
enter antipholus of ephesus and the officer antipholus fear me not , man , i will not break away i give thee , ere i leave thee , so much money , to warrant thee , as i am for .

enter dromio of ephesus with a here comes my man , i think he brings the money .
how now , sir !
have you that i sent you for ?
here that , i warrant you , will pay them all .
antipholus but where the money ?
why , sir , i gave the money for the rope .
antipholus five hundred ducats , villain , for a rope ?
i serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
antipholus to what end did i bid thee hie thee home ?
to a , sir , and to that end am i returned .
antipholus and to that end , sir , i will welcome you .
beating him good sir , be patient .
nay , is for me to be patient , i am in adversity .
good , now , hold thy tongue .
nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
antipholus thou whoreson , senseless villain !
i would i were senseless , sir , that i might not feel your blows .
thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
i am an ass , indeed , you may prove it by my long ears .
i have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .
when i am cold , he heats me with beating , when i am warm , he cools me with beating , i am waked with it when i sleep , raised with it when i sit , driven out of doors with it when i go from home , welcomed home with it when i return , nay , i bear it on my shoulders , as a beggar wont her brat , and , i think when he hath lamed me , i shall beg with it from door to door .
antipholus come , go along , my wife is coming yonder .
enter adriana , luciana , the courtezan , and pinch mistress , finem , ' respect your end , or rather , the prophecy like the parrot , the . '
antipholus wilt thou still talk ?
beating him how say you now ?
is not your husband mad ?
his incivility confirms no less .
good doctor pinch , you are a conjurer , establish him in his true sense again , and i will please you what you will demand .
alas , how fiery and how sharp he looks !
mark how he trembles in his ecstasy !
give me your hand and let me feel your pulse .
antipholus there is my hand , and let it feel your ear .
striking him i charge thee , satan , housed within this man , to yield possession to my holy prayers and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven !
antipholus peace , doting wizard , peace !
i am not mad .
o , that thou wert not , poor distressed soul !
antipholus you minion , you , are these your customers ?
did this companion with the saffron face revel and feast it at my house , whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut and i denied to enter in my house ?
o husband , god doth know you dined at home , where would you had remain until this time , free from these slanders and this open shame !
antipholus dined at home !
thou villain , what sayest thou ?
sir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .
antipholus were not my doors lock up and i shut out ?
perdie , your doors were lock and you shut out .
antipholus and did not she herself revile me there ?
sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
antipholus did not her rail , taunt , and scorn me ?
certes , she did , the scorn you .
antipholus and did not i in rage depart from thence ?
in verity you did , my bones bear witness , that since have felt the vigour of his rage .
good to soothe him in these contraries ?
it is no shame the fellow finds his vein , and yielding to him humours well his frenzy .
antipholus thou hast suborn the goldsmith to arrest me .
alas , i sent you money to redeem you , by dromio here , who came in haste for it .
money by me !
heart and goodwill you might , but surely master , not a rag of money .
antipholus not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
he came to me and i deliver it .
and i am witness with her that she did .
god and the bear me witness that i was sent for nothing but a rope !
mistress , both man and master is possess , i know it by their pale and deadly looks they must be bound and laid in some dark room .
antipholus say , wherefore didst thou lock me forth ?
and why dost thou deny the bag of gold ?
i did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
and , gentle master , i received no gold , but i confess , sir , that we were lock out .
dissembling villain , thou false in both .
antipholus dissembling harlot , thou art false in all , and art confederate with a damned pack to make a loathsome abject scorn of me but with these nails i pluck out these false eyes that would behold in me this shameful sport .
enter three or four , and offer to bind him .
he strives o , bind him , bind him !
let him not come near me .
more company !
the fiend is strong within him .
ay me , poor man , how pale and wan he looks !
antipholus what , will you murder me ?
thou gaoler , thou , i am thy prisoner wilt thou suffer them to make a rescue ?
masters , let him go he is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
go bind this man , for he is frantic too .
they offer to bind dromio of ephesus what wilt thou do , thou peevish officer ?
hast thou delight to see a wretched man do outrage and displeasure to himself ?
he is my prisoner if i let him go , the debt he owes will be required of me .
i will discharge thee ere i go from thee bear me forthwith unto his creditor , and , knowing how the debt grows , i will pay it .
good master doctor , see him safe convey home to my house .
o most unhappy day !
antipholus o most unhappy strumpet !
master , i am here entered in bond for you .
antipholus out on thee , villain !
wherefore dost thou mad me ?
will you be bound for nothing ?
be mad , good master cry devil ! '
god help , poor souls , how idly do they talk !
go bear him hence .
sister , go you with me .
exeunt all but adriana , luciana , officer and courtezan say now , whose suit is he arrested at ?
one angelo , a goldsmith do you know him ?
i know the man .
what is the sum he owes ?
two hundred ducats .
say , how grows it due ?
due for a chain your husband had of him .
he did bespeak a chain for me , but had it not .
when as your husband all in rage came to my house and took away my ring the ring i saw upon his finger now straight after did i meet him with a chain .
it may be so , but i did never see it .
come , gaoler , bring me where the goldsmith is i long to know the truth hereof at large .

faith , stay here this night , they will surely do us no harm you saw they speak us fair , give us gold methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me , i could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch .
antipholus i will not stay for all the town , therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
exeunt act v scene i .
a street before a priory .
enter second merchant and angelo i am sorry , sir , that i have hinder you , but , i protest , he had the chain of me , though most dishonestly he doth deny it .
how is the man esteemed here in the city ?
of very reverend reputation , sir , of credit infinite , highly beloved , second to none that lives here in the city his word might bear my wealth at any time .
speak softly , yonder , as i think , he walks .
enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse is so , and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have .
good sir , draw near to me , i speak to him .
signior antipholus , i wonder much that you would put me to this shame and trouble , and , not without some scandal to yourself , with circumstance and oaths so to deny this chain which now you wear so openly beside the charge , the shame , imprisonment , you have done wrong to this my honest friend , who , but for staying on our controversy , had hoisted sail and put to sea this chain you had of me , can you deny it ?
antipholus i think i had , i never did deny it .
yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .
antipholus who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
these ears of mine , thou did hear thee .
fie on thee , wretch !
is pity that thou livest to walk where any honest man resort .
antipholus thou art a villain to impeach me thus i prove mine honour and mine honesty against thee presently , if thou darest stand .
i dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
they draw enter adriana , luciana , the courtezan , and others hold , hurt him not , for god sake !
he is mad .
some get within him , take his sword away bind dromio too , and bear them to my house .
run , master , run , for god sake , take a house !
this is some priory .
in , or we are spoil !
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse to the priory enter the lady abbess , aemilia be quiet , people .
wherefore throng you hither ?
to fetch my poor distracted husband hence .
let us come in , that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery .
i knew he was not in his perfect wits .
i am sorry now that i did draw on him .
how long hath this possession held the man ?
this week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , and much different from the man he was , but till this afternoon his passion brake into extremity of rage .
hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea ?
buried some dear friend ?
hath not else his eye stray his affection in unlawful love ?
a sin prevailing much in youthful men , who give their eyes the liberty of gazing .
which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
to none of these , except it be the last , namely , some love that drew him oft from home .
you should for that have reprehended him .
why , so i did .
ay , but not rough enough .
as roughly as my modesty would let me .
haply , in private .
and in assemblies too .
ay , but not enough .
it was the copy of our conference in bed he slept not for my urging it , at board he fed not for my urging it , alone , it was the subject of my theme , in company i often glanced it , still did i tell him it was vile and bad .
and thereof came it that the man was mad .
the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog tooth .
it seems his sleeps were hinder by thy railing , and therefore comes it that his head is light .
thou his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions , thereof the raging fire of fever bred , and what a fever but a fit of madness ?
thou his sports were hinderd by thy brawls sweet recreation barr , what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy , kinsman to grim and comfortless despair , and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life ?
in food , in sport and rest to be disturb , would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
she never reprehended him but mildly , when he demean himself rough , rude and wildly .
why bear you these rebukes and answer not ?
she did betray me to my own reproof .
good people enter and lay hold on him .
no , not a creature enters in my house .
then let your servants bring my husband forth .
neither he took this place for sanctuary , and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again , or lose my labour in assaying it .
i will attend my husband , be his nurse , diet his sickness , for it is my office , and will have no attorney but myself , and therefore let me have him home with me .
be patient , for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have , with wholesome syrups , drugs and holy prayers , to make of him a formal man again it is a branch and parcel of mine oath , a charitable duty of my order .
therefore depart and leave him here with me .
i will not hence and leave my husband here and ill it doth beseem your holiness to separate the husband and the wife .
be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him .
exit complain unto the duke of this indignity .
come , go i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess .
by this , i think , the dial points at five anon , i sure , the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale , the place of death and sorry execution , behind the ditches of the abbey here .
upon what cause ?
to see a reverend syracusian merchant , who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town , beheaded publicly for his offence .
see where they come we will behold his death .
kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
enter duke solinus , attended , aegeon bareheaded , with the headsman and other officers yet once again proclaim it publicly , if any friend will pay the sum for him , he shall not die , so much we tender him .
justice , most sacred duke , against the abbess !
she is a virtuous and a reverend lady it can not be that she hath done thee wrong .
may it please your grace , antipholus , my husband , whom i made lord of me and all i had , at your important letters , this ill day a most outrageous fit of madness took him , that desperately he hurried through the street , with him his bondman , all as mad as he doing displeasure to the citizens by rushing in their houses , bearing thence rings , jewels , any thing his rage did like .
once did i get him bound and sent him home , whilst to take order for the wrongs i went , that here and there his fury had committed .
anon , i wot not by what strong escape , he broke from those that had the guard of him , and with his mad attendant and himself , each one with ireful passion , with drawn swords , met us again and madly bent on us , chased us away , till , raising of more aid , we came again to bind them .
then they fled into this abbey , whither we pursued them and here the abbess shuts the gates on us and will not suffer us to fetch him out , nor send him forth that we may bear him hence .
therefore , most gracious duke , with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .
long since thy husband served me in my wars , and i to thee engaged a prince word , when thou didst make him master of thy bed , to do him all the grace and good i could .
go , some of you , knock at the and bid the lady abbess come to me .
i will determine this before i stir .
enter a servant o mistress , mistress , shift and save yourself !
my master and his man are both broke loose , beaten the maids and bound the doctor whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire , and ever , as it blazed , they threw on him great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair my master preaches patience to him and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool , and sure , unless you send some present help , between them they will kill the conjurer .
peace , fool !
thy master and his man are here , and that is false thou dost report to us .
mistress , upon my life , i tell you true , i have not breathed almost since i did see it .
he cries for you , and vows , if he can take you , to scorch your face and to disfigure you .
cry within hark , hark !
i hear him , mistress .
fly , be gone !
come , stand by me , fear nothing .
guard with halberds !
ay me , it is my husband !
witness you , that he is borne about invisible even now we housed him in the abbey here , and now he there , past thought of human reason .
enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus antipholus justice , most gracious duke , o , grant me justice !
even for the service that long since i did thee , when i bestrid thee in the wars and took deep scars to save thy life , even for the blood that then i lost for thee , now grant me justice .
unless the fear of death doth make me dote , i see my son antipholus and dromio .
antipholus justice , sweet prince , against that woman there !
she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife , that hath abused and dishonour me even in the strength and height of injury !
beyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me .
discover how , and thou shalt find me just .
antipholus this day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me , while she with harlots feasted in my house .
a grievous fault !
say , woman , didst thou so ?
no , my good lord myself , he and my sister did dine together .
so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal !
may i look on day , nor sleep on night , but she tells to your highness simple truth !
o perjured woman !
they are both forsworn in this the madman justly chargeth them .
antipholus my liege , i am advised what i say , neither disturbed with the effect of wine , nor , provoked with raging ire , albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad .
this woman lock me out this day from dinner that goldsmith there , were he not pack with her , could witness it , for he was with me then , who parted with me to go fetch a chain , promising to bring it to the porpentine , where balthazar and i did dine together .
our dinner done , and he not coming thither , i went to seek him in the street i met him and in his company that gentleman .
there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him received the chain , which , god he knows , i saw not for the which he did arrest me with an officer .
i did obey , and sent my peasant home for certain ducats he with none return then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house .
by the way we met my wife , her sister , and a rabble more of vile confederates .
along with them they brought one pinch , a hungry villain , a mere anatomy , a mountebank , a threadbare juggler and a , a needy , , wretch , a man this pernicious slave , forsooth , took on him as a conjurer , and , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse , and with no face , as , outfacing me , cries out , i was possess .
then all together they fell upon me , bound me , bore me thence and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man , both bound together , till , gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder , i gain my freedom , and immediately ran hither to your grace , whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities .
my lord , in truth , thus far i witness with him , that he dined not at home , but was lock out .
but had he such a chain of thee or no ?
he had , my lord and when he ran in here , these people saw the chain about his neck .
besides , i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him after you first forswore it on the mart and thereupon i drew my sword on you , and then you fled into this abbey here , from whence , i think , you are come by miracle .
antipholus i never came within these , nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me i never saw the chain , so help me heaven !
and this is false you burden me withal .
why , what an intricate impeach is this !
i think you all have drunk of circe cup .
if here you housed him , here he would have been , if he were mad , he would not plead so coldly you say he dined at home , the goldsmith here denies that saying .
sirrah , what say you ?
sir , he dined with her there , at the porpentine .
he did , and from my finger snatch that ring .
antipholus is true , my liege , this ring i had of her .
thou him enter at the abbey here ?
as sure , my liege , as i do see your grace .
why , this is strange .
go call the abbess hither .
i think you are all mated or stark mad .
exit one to abbess most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me .
speak freely , syracusian , what thou wilt .
is not your name , sir , call antipholus ?
and is not that your bondman , dromio ?
within this hour i was his bondman sir , but he , i thank him , gnaw in two my cords now am i dromio and his man unbound .
i am sure you both of you remember me .
ourselves we do remember , sir , by you , for lately we were bound , as you are now you are not pinch patient , are you , sir ?
why look you strange on me ?
you know me well .
i never saw you in my life till now .
o , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , and careful hours with time deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face but tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ?
antipholus neither .
dromio , nor thou ?
no , trust me , sir , nor i .
i am sure thou dost .
ay , sir , but i am sure i do not , and whatsoever a man denies , you are now bound to believe him .
not know my voice !
o time extremity , hast thou so crack and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years , that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?
though now this grained face of mine be hid in winter drizzled snow , and all the conduits of my blood froze up , yet hath my night of life some memory , my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , my dull deaf ears a little use to hear all these old witnesses i can not err tell me thou art my son antipholus .
antipholus i never saw my father in my life .
but seven years since , in syracusa , boy , thou we parted but perhaps , my son , thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery .
antipholus the duke and all that know me in the city can witness with me that it is not so i saw syracusa in my life .
i tell thee , syracusian , twenty years have i been patron to antipholus , during which time he saw syracusa i see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
aemilia , with antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse most mighty duke , behold a man much wrong .
all gather to see them i see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
one of these men is genius to the other , and so of these .
which is the natural man , and which the spirit ?
who deciphers them ?
i , sir , am dromio , command him away .
i , sir , am dromio , pray , let me stay .
antipholus aegeon art thou not ?
or else his ghost ?
o , my old master !
who hath bound him here ?
whoever bound him , i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty .
speak , old aegeon , if thou the man that hadst a wife once call aemilia that bore thee at a burden two fair sons o , if thou the same aegeon , speak , and speak unto the same aemilia !
if i dream not , thou art aemilia if thou art she , tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
by men of epidamnum he and i and the twin dromio all were taken up , but by and by rude fishermen of corinth by force took dromio and my son from them and me they left with those of epidamnum .
what then became of them i can not tell i to this fortune that you see me in .
why , here begins his morning story right , these two antipholuses , these two so like , and these two dromios , one in semblance , besides her urging of her wreck at sea , these are the parents to these children , which accidentally are met together .
antipholus , thou camest from corinth first ?
antipholus no , sir , not i , i came from syracuse .
stay , stand apart , i know not which is which .
antipholus i came from corinth , my most gracious lord , and i with him .
antipholus brought to this town by that most famous warrior , duke menaphon , your most renowned uncle .
which of you two did dine with me ?
antipholus i , gentle mistress .
and are not you my husband ?
antipholus no , i say nay to that .
antipholus and so do i , yet did she call me so and this fair gentlewoman , her sister here , did call me brother .
to luciana what i told you then , i hope i shall have leisure to make good , if this be not a dream i see and hear .
that is the chain , sir , which you had of me .
antipholus i think it be , sir , i deny it not .
antipholus and you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
i think i did , sir , i deny it not .
i sent you money , sir , to be your bail , by dromio , but i think he brought it not .
no , none by me .
antipholus this purse of ducats i received from you , and dromio , my man , did bring them me .
i see we still did meet each other man , and i was for him , and he for me , and thereupon these errors are arose .
antipholus these ducats pawn i for my father here .
it shall not need , thy father hath his life .
sir , i must have that diamond from you .
antipholus there , take it , and much thanks for my good cheer .
renowned duke , vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes and all that are assembled in this place , that by this sympathized one day error have suffer wrong , go keep us company , and we shall make full satisfaction .
years have i but gone in travail of you , my sons , and till this present hour my heavy burden delivered .
the duke , my husband and my children both , and you the calendars of their nativity , go to a gossips ' feast and go with me , after so long grief , such festivity !
with all my heart , i gossip at this feast .
exeunt all but antipholus of syracuse , antipholus of ephesus , dromio of syracuse and dromio of ephesus master , shall i fetch your stuff from shipboard ?
antipholus dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embark ?
your goods that lay at host , sir , in the centaur .
antipholus he speaks to me .
i am your master , dromio come , go with us , we look to that anon embrace thy brother there , rejoice with him .
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and antipholus of ephesus there is a fat friend at your master house , that kitchen me for you at dinner she now shall be my sister , not my wife .
methinks you are my glass , and not my brother i see by you i am a youth .
will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
not i , sir , you are my elder .
that a question how shall we try it ?
we draw cuts for the senior till then lead thou first .
nay , then , thus we came into the world like brother and brother , and now let go hand in hand , not one before another .
exeunt act i scene rome .
a street .
enter a company of mutinous citizens , with staves , clubs , and other weapons before we proceed any further , hear me speak .
speak , speak .
you are all resolved rather to die than to famish ?
resolved .
resolved .
first , you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people .
we , we .
let us kill him , and we have corn at our own price .
a verdict ?
no more talking o , let it be done away , away !
one word , good citizens .
we are accounted poor citizens , the patricians good .
what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity , while it were wholesome , we might guess they relieved us humanely , but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us , the object of our misery , is as an inventory to particularise their abundance , our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes , ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread , not in thirst for revenge .
would you proceed especially against caius marcius ?
against him first he a very dog to the commonalty .
consider you what services he has done for his country ?
very well , and could be content to give him good report fort , but that he pays himself with being proud .
nay , but speak not maliciously .
i say unto you , what he hath done famously , he did it to that end though men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud , which he is , even till the altitude of his virtue .
what he can not help in his nature , you account a vice in him .
you must in no way say he is covetous .
if i must not , i need not be barren of accusations , he hath faults , with surplus , to tire in repetition .
shouts within what shouts are these ?
the other side o ' the city is risen why stay we prating here ?
to the capitol !
come , come .
soft !
who comes here ?
enter menenius agrippa worthy menenius agrippa , one that hath always loved the people .
he one honest enough would all the rest were so !
what work , my countrymen , in hand ?
where go you with bats and clubs ?
the matter ?
speak , i pray you .
our business is not unknown to the senate , they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do , which now we show in deeds .
they say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too .
why , masters , my good friends , mine honest neighbours , will you undo yourselves ?
we can not , sir , we are undone already .
i tell you , friends , most charitable care have the patricians of you .
for your wants , your suffering in this dearth , you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state , whose course will on the way it takes , cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment .
for the dearth , the gods , not the patricians , make it , and your knees to them , not arms , must help .
alack , you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you , and you slander the helms o ' the state , who care for you like fathers , when you curse them as enemies .
care for us !
true , indeed !
they cared for us yet suffer us to famish , and their crammed with grain , make edicts for usury , to support usurers , repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich , and provide more piercing statutes daily , to chain up and restrain the poor .
if the wars eat us not up , they will , and there all the love they bear us .
either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious , or be accused of folly .
i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it , but , since it serves my purpose , i will venture to stale a little more .
well , i hear it , sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but , an please you , deliver .
there was a time when all the body members rebell against the belly , thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i ' the midst o ' the body , idle and unactive , still cupboarding the viand , never bearing like labour with the rest , where the other instruments did see and hear , devise , instruct , walk , feel , and , mutually participate , did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body .
the belly answer well , sir , what answer made the belly ?
sir , i shall tell you .
with a kind of smile , which came from the lungs , but even thus for , look you , i may make the belly smile as well as speak it tauntingly replied to the discontented members , the mutinous parts that envied his receipt , even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you .
your belly answer ?
what !
the head , the vigilant eye , the counsellor heart , the arm our soldier , our steed the leg , the tongue our trumpeter .
with other muniments and petty helps in this our fabric , if that they what then ?
me , this fellow speaks !
what then ?
what then ?
should by the cormorant belly be restrain , who is the sink o ' the body , well , what then ?
the former agents , if they did complain , what could the belly answer ?
i will tell you if you bestow a small of what you have little patience awhile , you hear the belly answer .
ye long about it .
note me this , good friend , your most grave belly was deliberate , not rash like his accusers , and thus answer is it , my incorporate friends , ' quoth he , i receive the general food at first , which you do live upon , and fit it is , because i am the and the shop of the whole body but , if you do remember , i send it through the rivers of your blood , even to the court , the heart , to the seat o ' the brain , and , through the cranks and offices of man , the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once , you , my good friends , ' this says the belly , mark me , ay , sir , well , well .
all at once can not see what i do deliver out to each , yet i can make my audit up , that all from me do back receive the flour of all , and leave me but the bran . '
what say you ?
it was an answer how apply you this ?
the senators of rome are this good belly , and you the mutinous members , for examine their counsels and their cares , digest things rightly touching the weal o ' the common , you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves .
what do you think , you , the great toe of this assembly ?
i the great toe !
why the great toe ?
for that , being one o ' the lowest , basest , poorest , of this most wise rebellion , thou foremost thou rascal , that art worst in blood to run , first to win some vantage .
but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle , the one side must have bale .
enter caius marcius hail , noble marcius !
thanks .
what the matter , you dissentious rogues , that , rubbing the poor itch of your opinion , make yourselves scabs ?
we have ever your good word .
he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring .
what would you have , you curs , that like nor peace nor war ?
the one affrights you , the other makes you proud .
he that trusts to you , where he should find you lions , finds you hares , where foxes , geese you are no surer , no , than is the coal of fire upon the ice , or hailstone in the sun .
your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it .
who deserves greatness deserves your hate , and your affections are a sick man appetite , who desires most that which would increase his evil .
he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes .
hang ye !
trust ye ?
with every minute you do change a mind , and call him noble that was now your hate , him vile that was your garland .
what the matter , that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate , who , under the gods , keep you in awe , which else would feed on one another ?
what their seeking ?
for corn at their own rates , whereof , they say , the city is well stored .
hang !
they say !
they sit by the fire , and presume to know what done i ' the capitol , who like to rise , who thrives and who declines , side factions and give out conjectural marriages , making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes .
they say there grain enough !
would the nobility lay aside their ruth , and let me use my sword , i make a quarry with thousands of these quarter slaves , as high as i could pick my lance .
nay , these are almost thoroughly persuaded , for though abundantly they lack discretion , yet are they passing cowardly .
but , i beseech you , what says the other troop ?
they are dissolved hang !
they said they were , sigh forth proverbs , that hunger broke stone walls , that dogs must eat , that meat was made for mouths , that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings , which being answer , and a petition granted them , a strange one to break the heart of generosity , and make bold power look pale they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o ' the moon , shouting their emulation .
what is granted them ?
five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms , of their own choice one junius brutus , sicinius velutus , and i know not !
the rabble should have first unroof the city , ere so prevail with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection arguing .
this is strange .
go , get you home , you fragments !
enter a messenger , hastily where caius marcius ?
here what the matter ?
the news is , sir , the volsces are in arms .
i am glad on then we shall ha ' means to vent our musty superfluity .
see , our best elders .
enter cominius , titus lartius , and other senators , junius brutus and sicinius velutus marcius , is true that you have lately told us , the volsces are in arms .
they have a leader , tullus aufidius , that will put you to .
i sin in envying his nobility , and were i any thing but what i am , i would wish me only he .
you have fought together .
were half to half the world by the ears and he .
upon my party , revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt .
then , worthy marcius , attend upon cominius to these wars .
it is your former promise .
sir , it is , and i am constant .
titus lartius , thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus ' face .
what , art thou stiff ?
out ?
no , caius marcius , i lean upon one crutch and fight with , ere stay behind this business .
o , !
your company to the capitol , where , i know , our greatest friends attend us .
to cominius lead you on .
to marcius right worthy you priority .
noble marcius !
to the citizens hence to your homes , be gone !
nay , let them follow the volsces have much corn , take these rats thither to gnaw their garners .
worshipful mutiners , your valour puts well forth pray , follow .
citizens steal away .
exeunt all but sicinius and brutus was ever man so proud as is this marcius ?
he has no equal .
when we were chosen tribunes for the people , mark you his lip and eyes ?
nay .
but his taunts .
being moved , he will not spare to gird the gods .
the modest moon .
the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant .
such a nature , tickled with good success , disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius .
fame , at the which he aims , in whom already he well graced , can not better be held nor more attain than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the general fault , though he perform to the utmost of a man , and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius ' o if he had borne the business ! '
besides , if things go well , opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius .
come half all cominius ' honours are to marcius .
though marcius earned them not , and all his faults to marcius shall be honours , though indeed in aught he merit not .
let hence , and hear how the dispatch is made , and in what fashion , more than his singularity , he goes upon this present action .
lets along .

enter tullus aufidius and certain senators so , your opinion is , aufidius , that they of rome are entered in our counsels and know how we proceed .
is it not yours ?
what ever have been thought on in this state , that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention ?
is not four days gone since i heard thence , these are the words i think i have the letter here , yes , here it is .
reads have press a power , but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great , the people mutinous , and it is rumour , cominius , marcius your old enemy , who is of rome worse hated than of you , and titus lartius , a most valiant roman , these three lead on this preparation whither is bent most likely is for you consider of it . '
our army in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us .
nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veil till when they needs must show themselves , which in the hatching , it seem , appear to rome .
by the discovery .
we shall be shorten in our aim , which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot .
noble aufidius , take your commission , hie you to your bands let us alone to guard corioli if they set down before , for the remove bring your army , but , i think , you find they not prepared for us .
o , doubt not that , i speak from certainties .
nay , more , some parcels of their power are forth already , and only hitherward .
i leave your honours .
if we and caius marcius chance to meet , is sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more .
the gods assist you !
and keep your honours safe !
farewell .
farewell .
farewell .
exeunt scene iii .
rome .
a room in marcius ' house .
enter volumnia and virgilia they set them down on two low stools , and sew i pray you , daughter , sing , or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband , i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love .
when yet he was but and the only son of my womb , when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way , when for a day of kings ' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding , i , considering how honour would become such a person .
that it was no better than to hang by the wall , if renown made it not stir , was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame .
to a cruel war i sent him , from whence he returned , his brows bound with oak .
i tell thee , daughter , i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man .
but had he died in the business , madam , how then ?
then his good report should have been my son , i therein would have found issue .
hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons , each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good marcius , i had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action .
enter a gentlewoman madam , the lady valeria is come to visit you .
beseech you , give me leave to retire myself .
indeed , you shall not .
methinks i hear hither your husband drum , see him pluck aufidius down by the hair , as children from a bear , the volsces shunning him methinks i see him stamp thus , and call thus on , you cowards !
you were got in fear , though you were born in rome ' his bloody brow with his mail hand then wiping , forth he goes , like to a that task to mow or all or lose his hire .
his bloody brow !
o jupiter , no blood !
away , you fool !
it more becomes a man than gilt his trophy the breasts of hecuba , when she did suckle hector , look not lovelier than hector forehead when it spit forth blood at grecian sword , contemning .
tell valeria , we are fit to bid her welcome .
exit gentlewoman heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius !
he beat aufidius below his knee and tread upon his neck .
enter valeria , with an usher and gentlewoman my ladies both , good day to you .
sweet madam .
i am glad to see your ladyship .
how do you both ?
you are manifest .
what are you sewing here ?
a fine spot , in good faith .
how does your little son ?
i thank your ladyship , well , good madam .
he had rather see the swords , and hear a drum , than look upon his .
o ' my word , the father son i swear , is a very pretty boy .
o ' my troth , i looked upon him o ' wednesday half an hour together has such a confirmed countenance .
i saw him run after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it , he let it go again , and after it again , and over and over he comes , and again , catched it again , or whether his fall enraged him , or how was , he did so set his teeth and tear it , o , i warrant it , how he mammocked it !
one on father moods .
indeed , la , is a noble child .
a crack , madam .
come , lay aside your stitchery , i must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon .
no , good madam , i will not out of doors .
not out of doors !
she shall , she shall .
indeed , no , by your patience , i not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars .
fie , you confine yourself most unreasonably come , you must go visit the good lady that lies in .
i will wish her speedy strength , and visit her with my prayers , but i can not go thither .
why , i pray you ?
is not to save labour , nor that i want love .
you would be another penelope yet , they say , all the yarn she spun in ulysses ' absence did but fill ithaca full of moths .
come , i would your cambric were sensible as your finger , that you might leave pricking it for pity .
come , you shall go with us .
no , good madam , pardon me , indeed , i will not forth .
in truth , la , go with me , and i tell you excellent news of your husband .
o , good madam , there can be none yet .
verily , i do not jest with you , there came news from him last night .
indeed , madam ?
in earnest , it true , i heard a senator speak it .
thus it is the volsces have an army forth , against whom cominius the general is gone , with one part of our roman power your lord and titus lartius are set down before their city corioli , they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars .
this is true , on mine honour , and so , i pray , go with us .
give me excuse , good madam , i will obey you in every thing hereafter .
let her alone , lady as she is now , she will but disease our better mirth .
in troth , i think she would .
fare you well , then .
come , good sweet lady .
prithee , virgilia , turn thy solemness out o ' door .
and go along with us .
no , at a word , madam , indeed , i must not .
i wish you much mirth .
well , then , farewell .
exeunt scene iv .
before corioli .
enter , with drum and colours , marcius , titus lartius , captains and soldiers .
to them a messenger yonder comes news .
a wager they have met .
my horse to yours , no .
is done .
agreed .
say , has our general met the enemy ?
they lie in view , but have not spoke as yet .
so , the good horse is mine .
i buy him of you .
no , i nor sell nor give him lend you him i will for half a hundred years .
summon the town .
how far off lie these armies ?
within this mile and half .
then shall we hear their , and they ours .
now , mars , i prithee , make us quick in work , that we with smoking swords may march from hence , to help our fielded friends !
come , blow thy blast .
they sound a parley .
enter two senators with others on the walls tutus aufidius , is he within your walls ?
no , nor a man that fears you less than he , that lesser than a little .
drums afar off hark !
our drums are bringing forth our youth .
we break our walls , rather than they shall pound us up our gates , which yet seem shut , we , have but pinn with rushes , they open of themselves .
alarum afar off hark you .
far off !
there is aufidius , list , what work he makes amongst your cloven army .
o , they are at it !
their noise be our instruction .
ladders , ho !
enter the army of the volsces they fear us not , but issue forth their city .
now put your shields before your hearts , and fight with hearts more proof than shields .
advance , brave titus they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts , which makes me sweat with wrath .
come on , my fellows he that retires i take him for a volsce , and he shall feel mine edge .
alarum .
the romans are beat back to their trenches .
marcius cursing all the contagion of the south light on you , you shames of rome !
you herd of boils and plagues plaster you , that you may be abhorr further than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile !
you souls of geese , that bear the shapes of men , how have you run from slaves that apes would beat !
pluto and hell !
all hurt behind , backs red , and faces pale with flight and agued fear !
mend and charge home , or , by the fires of heaven , i leave the foe and make my wars on you look come on , if you stand fast , we beat them to their wives , as they us to our trenches followed .
another alarum .
the volsces fly , and marcius follows them to the gates so , now the gates are ope now prove good seconds is for the followers fortune widens them , not for the fliers mark me , and do the like .
enters the gates , not i .
nor i .
marcius is shut in see , they have shut him in .
to the pot , i warrant him .
alarum continues titus lartius what is become of marcius ?
slain , sir , doubtless .
following the fliers at the very heels , with them he enters , who , upon the sudden , clapp to their gates he is himself alone , to answer all the city .
o noble fellow !
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword , and , when it bows , stands up .
thou art left , marcius a carbuncle entire , as big as thou art , were not so rich a jewel .
thou wast a soldier even to cato wish , not fierce and terrible only in strokes , but , with thy grim looks and the percussion of thy sounds , thou madst thine enemies shake , as if the world were feverous and did tremble .
marcius , bleeding , assaulted by the enemy look , sir .
o , is marcius !
let fetch him off , or make remain alike .
they fight , and all enter the city scene corioli .
a street .
enter certain romans , with spoils this will i carry to rome .
and i this .
a murrain o !
i took this for silver .
alarum continues still afar off enter marcius and titus lartius with a trumpet see here these movers that do prize their hours at a crack drachm !
cushions , leaden spoons , irons of a doit , doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them , these base slaves , ere yet the fight be done , pack up down with them !
and hark , what noise the general makes !
to him !
there is the man of my soul hate , aufidius , piercing our romans then , valiant titus , take convenient numbers to make good the city , whilst i , with those that have the spirit , will haste to help cominius .
worthy sir , thou , thy exercise hath been too violent for a second course of fight .
sir , praise me not , my work hath yet not warm me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear , and fight .
now the fair goddess , fortune , fall deep in love with thee , and her great charms misguide thy opposers ' swords !
bold gentleman , prosperity be thy page !
thy friend no less than those she placeth highest !
so , farewell .
thou worthiest marcius !
exit marcius go , sound thy trumpet in the , call thither all the officers o ' the town , where they shall know our mind away !
exeunt scene vi .
near the camp of cominius .
enter cominius , as it were in retire , with soldiers breathe you , my friends well fought , we are come off like romans , neither foolish in our stands , nor cowardly in retire believe me , sirs , we shall be charged again .
whiles we have struck , by interims and conveying gusts we have heard the charges of our friends .
ye roman gods !
lead their successes as we wish our own , that both our powers , with smiling fronts encountering , may give you thankful sacrifice .
enter a messenger thy news ?
the citizens of corioli have issued , and given to lartius and to marcius battle i saw our party to their trenches driven , and then i came away .
though thou truth , methinks thou not well .
how long since ?
above an hour , my lord .
is not a mile , briefly we heard their drums how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour , and bring thy news so late ?
spies of the volsces held me in chase , that i was forced to wheel three or four miles about , else had i , sir , half an hour since brought my report .
who yonder , that does appear as he were flay ?
o gods he has the stamp of marcius , and i have seen him thus .
within come i too late ?
the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour more than i know the sound of marcius ' tongue from every meaner man .
enter marcius come i too late ?
ay , if you come not in the blood of others , but mantled in your own .
o , let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i woo , in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done , and tapers burn to bedward !
flower of warriors , how is it with titus lartius ?
as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death , and some to exile , ransoming him , or pitying , threatening the other , holding corioli in the name of rome , even like a fawning greyhound in the leash , to let him slip at will .
where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches ?
where is he ?
call him hither .
let him alone , he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen , the common file a plague !
tribunes for them ! the mouse shunn the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they .
but how prevail you ?
will the time serve to tell ?
i do not think .
where is the enemy ?
are you lords o ' the field ?
if not , why cease you till you are so ?
marcius , we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose .
how lies their battle ?
know you on which side they have placed their men of trust ?
as i guess , marcius , their bands i ' the vaward are the antiates , of their best trust , them aufidius , their very heart of hope .
i do beseech you , by all the battles wherein we have fought , by the blood we have shed together , by the vows we have made to endure friends , that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates , and that you not delay the present , but , filling the air with swords advanced and darts , we prove this very hour .
though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to , you , yet dare i never deny your asking take your choice of those that best can aid your action .
those are they that most are willing .
if any such be here as it were sin to doubt that love this painting wherein you see me smear , if any fear lesser his person than an ill report , if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country dearer than himself , let him alone , or so many so minded , wave thus , to express his disposition , and follow marcius .
they all shout and wave their swords , take him up in their arms , and cast up their caps o , me alone !
make you a sword of me ?
if these shows be not outward , which of you but is four volsces ?
none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his .
a certain number , though thanks to all , must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight , as cause will be obey .
please you to march , and four shall quickly draw out my command , which men are best inclined .
march on , my fellows make good this ostentation , and you shall divide in all with us .
exeunt scene vii .
the gates of corioli .
titus lartius , having set a guard upon corioli , going with drum and trumpet toward cominius and caius marcius , enters with lieutenant , other soldiers , and a scout so , let the ports be guarded keep your duties , as i have set them down .
if i do send , dispatch those centuries to our aid the rest will serve for a short holding if we lose the field , we can not keep the town .
fear not our care , sir .
hence , and shut your gates upon .
our guider , come , to the roman camp conduct us .
exeunt scene viii .
a field of battle .
alarum as in battle .
enter , from opposite sides , marcius and aufidius i fight with none but thee , for i do hate thee worse than a .
we hate alike not afric owns a serpent i abhor more than thy fame and envy .
fix thy foot .
let the first budger die the other slave , and the gods doom him after !
if i fly , marcius , holloa me like a hare .
within these three hours , tullus , alone i fought in your corioli walls , and made what work i pleased is not my blood wherein thou seest me mask , for thy revenge wrench up thy power to the highest .
wert thou the hector that was the whip of your bragg progeny , thou shouldst not scape me here .
they fight , and certain volsces come to the aid of aufidius .
marcius fights till they be driven in breathless officious , and not valiant , you have shamed me in your condemned seconds .
exeunt scene ix .
the roman camp .
flourish .
alarum .
a retreat is sounded .
flourish .
enter , from one side , cominius with the romans , from the other side , marcius , with his arm in a scarf if i should tell thee this thy day work , not believe thy deeds but i report it where senators shall mingle tears with smiles , where great patricians shall attend and shrug , i ' the end admire , where ladies shall be frighted , and , gladly quaked , hear more , where the dull tribunes , that , with the fusty plebeians , hate thine honours , shall say against their hearts thank the gods our rome hath such a soldier . '
yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast , having fully dined before .
enter titus lartius , with his power , from the pursuit o general , here is the steed , we the caparison hadst thou beheld pray now , no more my mother , who has a charter to extol her blood , when she does praise me grieves me .
i have done as you have done , that what i can , induced as you have been , that for my country he that has but effected his good will hath mine act .
you shall not be the grave of your deserving , rome must know the value of her own a concealment worse than a theft , no less than a traducement , to hide your doings , and to silence that , which , to the spire and top of praises vouch , would seem but modest therefore , i beseech you in sign of what you are , not to reward what you have done before our army hear me .
i have some wounds upon me , and they smart to hear themselves remember .
should they not , well might they fester ingratitude , and tent themselves with death .
of all the horses , whereof we have good and good store , of all the treasure in this field achieved and city , we render you the tenth , to be forth , before the common distribution , at your only choice .
i thank you , general , but can not make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it , and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing .
a long flourish .
they all cry !
marcius ! '
cast up their caps and lances cominius and lartius stand bare may these same instruments , which you profane , never sound more !
when drums and trumpets shall i ' the field prove flatterers , let courts and cities be made all of soothing !
when steel grows soft as the parasite silk , let him be made a coverture for the wars !
no more , i say !
for that i have not wash my nose that bled , or foil some debile which , without note , here many else have done , you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical , as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies .
too modest are you , more cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly by your patience , if yourself you be incensed , we put you , like one that means his proper harm , in manacles , then reason safely with you .
therefore , be it known , as to us , to all the world , that caius marcius wears this war garland in token of the which , my noble steed , known to the camp , i give him , with all his trim belonging , and from this time , for what he did before corioli , call him , with all the applause and clamour of the host , caius marcius coriolanus !
bear the addition nobly ever !
flourish .
trumpets sound , and drums caius marcius coriolanus !
i will go wash , and when my face is fair , you shall perceive whether i blush or no howbeit , i thank you .
i mean to stride your steed , and at all times to undercrest your good addition to the fairness of my power .
so , to our tent , where , ere we do repose us , we will write to rome of our success .
you , titus lartius , must to corioli back send us to rome the best , with whom we may articulate , for their own good and ours .
i shall , my lord .
the gods begin to mock me .
i , that now refused most princely gifts , am bound to beg of my lord general .
, is yours .
what ?
i sometime lay here in corioli at a poor man house , he used me kindly he cried to me , i saw him prisoner , but then aufidius was with in my view , and wrath my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom .
o , well begg !
were he the butcher of my son , he should be free as is the wind .
deliver him , titus .
marcius , his name ?
by jupiter !
forgot .
i am weary , yea , my memory is tired .
have we no wine here ?
go we to our tent the blood upon your visage dries , is time it should be look to come .
exeunt scene x .

cornets .
enter tullus aufidius , bloody , with two or three soldiers the town is !
be deliver back on good condition .
condition !
i would i were a roman , for i can not , being a volsce , be that i am .
condition !
what good condition can a treaty find i ' the part that is at mercy ?
five times , marcius , i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me , and wouldst do so , i think , should we encounter as often as we eat .
by the elements , if again i meet him beard to beard , he mine , or i am his mine emulation hath not that honour i it had , for where i thought to crush him in an equal force , true sword to sword , i potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him .
he the devil .
bolder , though not so subtle .
my valour poison with only suffering stain by him , for him shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary , being naked , sick , nor fane nor capitol , the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice , embarquements all of fury , shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom my hate to marcius where i find him , were it at home , upon my brother guard , even there , against the hospitable canon , would i wash my fierce hand in heart .
go you to the city , learn how is held , and what they are that must be hostages for rome .
will not you go ?
i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you is south the city mills bring me word thither how the world goes , that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey .
i shall , sir .
exeunt act ii scene rome .
a public place .
enter menenius with the two tribunes of the people , sicinius and brutus .
the augurer tells me we shall have news .
good or bad ?
not according to the prayer of the people , for they love not marcius .
nature teaches beasts to know their friends .
pray you , who does the wolf love ?
the lamb .
ay , to devour him , as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius .
he a lamb indeed , that baes like a bear .
he a bear indeed , that lives like a lamb .
you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you .
well , sir .
in what enormity is marcius poor in , that you two have not in abundance ?
he poor in no one fault , but stored with all .
especially in pride .
and topping all others in boasting .
this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city , i mean of us o ' the file ?
do you ?
why , how are we censured ?
because you talk of pride now , will you not be angry ?
well , well , sir , well .
why , is no great matter , for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins , and be angry at your pleasures , at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so .
you blame marcius for being proud ?
we do it not alone , sir .
i know you can do very little alone , for your helps are many , or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too for doing much alone .
you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks , and make but an interior survey of your good selves !
o that you could !
what then , sir ?
why , then you should discover a brace of unmeriting , proud , violent , testy magistrates , alias fools , as any in rome .
menenius , you are known well enough too .
i am known to be a humorous patrician , and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber i , said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint , hasty and upon too trivial motion , one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter , and spend my malice in my breath .
meeting two such wealsmen as you are i can not call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely , i make a crooked face at it .
i ca say your worships have delivered the matter well , when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men , yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces .
if you see this in the map of my microcosm , follows it that i am known well enough too ?
what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character , if i be known well enough too ?
come , sir , come , we know you well enough .
you know neither me , yourselves nor any thing .
you are ambitious for poor knaves ' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a , and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience .
when you are hearing a matter between party and party , if you chance to be pinched with the colic , you make faces like mummers , set up the bloody flag against all patience , and , in roaring for a , dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is , calling both the parties knaves .
you are a pair of strange ones .
come , come , you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol .
our very priests must become mockers , if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are .
when you speak best unto the purpose , it is not worth the wagging of your beards , and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher cushion , or to be entombed in an ass saddle .
yet you must be saying , marcius is proud , who in a cheap estimation , is worth predecessors since deucalion , though peradventure some of the best of were hereditary hangmen .
to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain , being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you .
brutus and sicinius go aside enter volumnia , virgilia , and valeria how now , my as fair as noble ladies , and the moon , were she earthly , no nobler , whither do you follow your eyes so fast ?
honourable menenius , my boy marcius approaches , for the love of juno , let go .
ha !
marcius coming home !
ay , worthy menenius , and with most prosperous approbation .
take my cap , jupiter , and i thank thee .
hoo !
marcius coming home !
nay , is true .
look , here a letter from him the state hath another , his wife another , and , i think , there one at home for you .
i will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me !
yes , certain , there a letter for you , i .
a letter for me !
it gives me an estate of seven years ' health , in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic , and , to this preservative , of no better report than a .
is he not wounded ?
he was wont to come home wounded .
o , no , no , no .
o , he is wounded , i thank the gods .
so do i too , if it be not too much brings a ' victory in his pocket ?
the wounds become him .
on brows menenius , he comes the third time home with the oaken garland .
has he disciplined aufidius soundly ?
titus lartius writes , they fought together , but aufidius got off .
and was time for him too , i warrant him that an he had stayed by him , i would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in corioli , and the gold that in them .
is the senate possessed of this ?
good ladies , let go .
yes , yes , yes , the senate has letters from the general , wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly in troth , there wondrous things spoke of him .
wondrous !
ay , i warrant you , and not without his true purchasing .
the gods grant them true !
true !
pow , wow .
true !
i be sworn they are true .
where is he wounded ?
to the tribunes god save your good worships !
marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud .
where is he wounded ?
i ' the shoulder and i ' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people , when he shall stand for his place .
he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i ' the body .
one i ' the neck , and two i ' the thigh , there nine that i know .
he had , before this last expedition , wounds upon him .
now it every gash was an enemy grave .
a shout and flourish hark !
the trumpets .
these are the ushers of marcius before him he carries noise , and behind him he leaves tears death , that dark spirit , in nervy arm doth lie , which , being advanced , declines , and then men die .
a sennet .
trumpets sound .
enter cominius the general , and titus lartius , between them , coriolanus , crowned with an oaken garland , with captains and soldiers , and a herald know , rome , that all alone marcius did fight within corioli gates where he hath won , with fame , a name to caius marcius , these in honour follows coriolanus .
welcome to rome , renowned coriolanus !
flourish welcome to rome , renowned coriolanus !
no more of this , it does offend my heart pray now , no more .
look , sir , your mother !
o , you have , i know , petition all the gods for my prosperity !
kneels nay , my good soldier , up , my gentle marcius , worthy caius , and by honour newly named , what is it ? coriolanus must i call thee ? but o , thy wife !
my gracious silence , hail !
wouldst thou have laugh had i come coffin home , that to see me triumph ?
ay , my dear , such eyes the widows in corioli wear , and mothers that lack sons .
now , the gods crown thee !
and live you yet ?
to valeria o my sweet lady , pardon .
i know not where to turn o , welcome home and welcome , general and ye welcome all .
a hundred thousand welcomes .
i could weep and i could laugh , i am light and heavy .
welcome .
a curse begin at very root on heart , that is not glad to see thee !
you are three that rome should dote on yet , by the faith of men , we have some old here at home that will not be grafted to your relish .
yet welcome , warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly .
ever right .
menenius ever , ever .
give way there , and go on !
to volumnia and virgilia your hand , and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head , the good patricians must be visited , from whom i have received not only greetings , but with them change of honours .
i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only there one thing wanting , which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee .
know , good mother , i had rather be their servant in my way , than sway with them in theirs .
on , to the capitol !

cornets .
exeunt in state , as before .
brutus and sicinius come forward all tongues speak of him , and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram her reechy neck , clambering the walls to eye him stalls , bulks , windows , are smother up , leads fill , and ridges horsed with variable complexions , all agreeing in earnestness to see him flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station or veil dames commit the war of white and damask in their cheeks to the wanton spoil of phoebus ' burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture .
on the sudden , i warrant him consul .
then our office may , during his power , go sleep .
he can not temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end , but will lose those he hath won .
in that there comfort .
doubt not the commoners , for whom we stand , but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours , which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to .
i heard him swear , were he to stand for consul , never would he appear i ' the nor on him put the napless vesture of humility , nor showing , as the manner is , his wounds to the people , beg their stinking breaths .
is right .
it was his word o , he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him , and the desire of the nobles .
i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution .
is most like he will .
it shall be to him then as our good wills , a sure destruction .
so it must fall out to him or our authorities .
for an end , we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them , that to power he would have made them mules , silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms , holding them , in human action and capacity , of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in the war , who have their provand only for bearing burdens , and sore blows for sinking under them .
this , as you say , suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people which time shall not want , if he be put upon , and that as easy as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble , and their blaze shall darken him for ever .
enter a messenger what the matter ?
you are sent for to the capitol .
is thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves , ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers , upon him as he pass the nobles bended , as to jove statue , and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like .
let to the capitol , and carry with us ears and eyes for the time , but hearts for the event .
have with you .
exeunt scene ii .
the same .
the capitol .
enter two officers , to lay cushions come , come , they are almost here .
how many stand for consulships ?
three , they say but is thought of every one coriolanus will carry it .
that a brave fellow , but he vengeance proud , and loves not the common people .
faith , there had been many great men that have flattered the people , who loved them , and there be many that they have loved , they know not wherefore so that , if they love they know not why , they hate upon no better a ground therefore , for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition , and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly .
if he did not care whether he had their love or no , he waved indifferently doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him , and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite .
now , to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes , to flatter them for their love .
he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who , having been supple and courteous to the people , bonneted , without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes , and his actions in their hearts , that for their tongues to be silent , and not confess so much , were a kind of ingrateful injury , to report otherwise , were a malice , that , giving itself the lie , would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it .
no more of him , he is a worthy man make way , they are coming .
a sennet .
enter , with actors before them , cominius the consul , menenius , coriolanus , senators , sicinius and brutus .
the senators take their places , the tribunes take their places by themselves .
coriolanus stands having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius , it remains , as the main point of this our , to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore , please you , most reverend and grave elders , to desire the present consul , and last general in our successes , to report a little of that worthy work perform by caius marcius coriolanus , whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself .
speak , good cominius leave nothing out for length , and make us think rather our state defective for requital than we to stretch it out .
to the tribunes masters o ' the people , we do request your kindest ears , and after , your loving motion toward the common body , to yield what passes here .
we are convented upon a pleasing treaty , and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly .
which the rather we shall be blest to do , if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prized them at .
that off , that off , i would you rather had been silent .
please you to hear cominius speak ?
most willingly , but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it .
he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow .
worthy cominius , speak .
coriolanus offers to go away nay , keep your place .
sit , coriolanus , never shame to hear what you have nobly done .
your horror pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them .
sir , i hope my words disbench you not .
no , sir yet oft , when blows have made me stay , i fled from words .
you soothed not , therefore hurt not but your people , i love them as they weigh .
pray now , sit down .
i had rather have one scratch my head i ' the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monster .
exit masters of the people , your multiplying spawn how can he flatter that thousand to one good one when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one on ears to hear it ?
proceed , cominius .
i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utter feebly .
it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue , and most dignifies the haver if it be , the man i speak of can not in the world be singly counterpoised .
at sixteen years , when tarquin made a head for rome , he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator , whom with all praise i point at , saw him fight , when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him be bestrid an roman and i ' the consul view slew three opposers tarquin self he met , and struck him on his knee in that day feats , when he might act the woman in the scene , he proved best man i ' the field , and for his meed was with the oak .
his pupil age thus , he waxed like a sea , and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurch all swords of the garland .
for this last , before and in corioli , let me say , i can not speak him home he stopp the fliers , and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail , so men obey and fell below his stem his sword , death stamp , where it did mark , it took , from face to foot he was a thing of blood , whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enter the mortal gate of the city , which he painted with shunless destiny , aidless came off , and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioli like a planet now all his when , by and by , the din of war gan pierce his ready sense , then straight his doubled spirit what in flesh was fatigate , and to the battle came he , where he did run reeking the lives of men , as if a perpetual spoil and till we call both field and city ours , he never stood to ease his breast with panting .
worthy man !
he can not but with measure fit the honours which we devise him .
our spoils he kick at , and look upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give , rewards his deeds with doing them , and is content to spend the time to end it .
he right noble let him be call for .
call coriolanus .
he doth appear .
coriolanus the senate , coriolanus , are well pleased to make thee consul .
i do owe them still my life and services .
it then remains that you do speak to the people .
i do beseech you , let me that custom , for i can not put on the gown , stand naked and entreat them , for my wounds ' sake , to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing .
sir , the people must have their voices , neither will they bate one jot of ceremony .
put them not pray you , go fit you to the custom and take to you , as your predecessors have , your honour with your form .
it is apart that i shall blush in acting , and might well be taken from the people .
mark you that ?
to brag unto them , thus i did , and thus , show them the unaching scars which i should hide , as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only !
do not stand upo .
we recommend to you , tribunes of the people , our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour .
to coriolanus come all joy and honour !
flourish of cornets .
exeunt all but sicinius and brutus you see how he intends to use the people .
may they perceive intent !
he will require them , as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give .
come , we inform them of our proceedings here on the marketplace , i know , they do attend us .
exeunt scene iii .
the same .
the forum .
enter seven or eight citizens once , if he do require our voices , we ought not to deny him .
we may , sir , if we will .
we have power in ourselves to do it , but it is a power that we have no power to do , for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds , we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them , so , if he tell us his noble deeds , we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them .
ingratitude is monstrous , and for the multitude to be ingrateful , were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members , should bring ourselves to be monstrous members .
and to make us no better thought of , a little help will serve , for once we stood up about the corn , he himself stuck not to call us the multitude .
we have been called so of many , not that our heads are some brown , some black , some auburn , some bald , but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull , they would fly east , west , north , south , and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o ' the compass .
think you so ?
which way do you judge my wit would fly ?
nay , your wit will not so soon out as another man will , is strongly wedged up in a , but if it were at liberty , , sure , southward .
why that way ?
to lose itself in a fog , where being three parts melted away with rotten dews , the fourth would return for conscience sake , to help to get thee a wife .
you are never without your tricks you may , you may .
are you all resolved to give your voices ?
but that no matter , the greater part carries it .
i say , if he would incline to the people , there was never a worthier man .
enter coriolanus in a gown of humility , with menenius here he comes , and in the gown of humility mark his behavior .
we are not to stay all together , but to come by him where he stands , by ones , by twos , and by threes .
he to make his requests by particulars , wherein every one of us has a single honour , in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me , and i direct you how you shall go by him .
content , content .
exeunt citizens o sir , you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have ?
what must i say ?
' i pray , sir ' plague upo !
i can not bring my tongue to such a pace , sir , my wounds !
i got them in my country service , when some certain of your brethren roar and ran from the noise of our own drums . '
o me , the gods !
you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you .
think upon me !
hang !
i would they would forget me , like the virtues which our divines lose by .
you mar all i leave you pray you , speak to , i pray you , in wholesome manner .
exit bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean .
two of the citizens so , here comes a brace .
a third citizen you know the cause , air , of my standing here .
we do , sir , tell us what hath brought you .
mine own desert .
your own desert !
ay , but not mine own desire .
how not your own desire ?
no , sir , was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging .
you must think , if we give you any thing , we hope to gain by you .
well then , i pray , your price o ' the consulship ?
the price is to ask it kindly .
kindly !
sir , i pray , let me i have wounds to show you , which shall be yours in private .
your good voice , sir , what say you ?
you shall ha ' it , worthy sir .
a match , sir .
there in all two worthy voices begged .
i have your alms adieu .
but this is something odd .
an to give again , but is no matter .
exeunt the three citizens two other citizens pray you now , if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul , i have here the customary gown .
you have deserved nobly of your country , and you have not deserved nobly .
your enigma ?
you have been a scourge to her enemies , you have been a rod to her friends , you have not indeed loved the common people .
you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love .
i will , sir , flatter my sworn brother , the people , to earn a dearer estimation of them , is a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart , i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly , that is , sir , i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers .
therefore , beseech you , i may be consul .
we hope to find you our friend , and therefore give you our voices heartily .
you have received many wounds for your country .
i will not seal your knowledge with showing them .
i will make much of your voices , and so trouble you no further .
the gods give you joy , sir , heartily !
exeunt most sweet voices !
better it is to die , better to starve , than crave the hire which first we do deserve .
why in this woolvish toge should i stand here , to beg of hob and dick , that do appear , their needless vouches ?
custom calls me what custom wills , in all things should we , the dust on antique time would lie unswept , and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to .
rather than fool it so , let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus .
i am half through , the one part suffer , the other will i do .
three citizens more here come more voices .
your voices for your voices i have fought , watch for your voices , for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd , battles thrice six i have seen and heard of , for your voices have done many things , some less , some more your voices indeed i would be consul .
he has done nobly , and can not go without any honest man voice .
therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy , and make him good friend to the people !
amen , amen .
god save thee , noble consul !
exeunt worthy voices !
menenius , with brutus and sicinius you have stood your limitation , and the tribunes endue you with the people voice remains that , in the official marks invested , you anon do meet the senate .
is this done ?
the custom of request you have discharged the people do admit you , and are summon to meet anon , upon your approbation .
where ?
at the ?
there , coriolanus .
may i change these garments ?
you may , sir .
that i straight do , and , knowing myself again , repair to the .
i keep you company .
will you along ?
we stay here for the people .
fare you well .
exeunt coriolanus and menenius he has it now , and by his looks methink is warm at heart .
with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds .
will you dismiss the people ?
citizens how now , my masters !
have you chose this man ?
he has our voices , sir .
we pray the gods he may deserve your loves .
amen , sir to my poor unworthy notice , he mock us when he begg our voices .
certainly he flouted us downright .
no , is his kind of speech he did not mock us .
not one amongst us , save yourself , but says he used us scornfully he should have show us his marks of merit , wounds received for country .
why , so he did , i am sure .
no , no , no man saw .
he said he had wounds , which he could show in private , and with his hat , thus waving it in scorn , ' i would be consul , ' says he custom , but by your voices , will not so permit me , your voices therefore . '
when we granted that , here was ' i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices , i have no further with you . '
was not this mockery ?
why either were you ignorant to , or , seeing it , of such childish friendliness to yield your voices ?
could you not have told him as you were lesson , when he had no power , but was a petty servant to the state , he was your enemy , ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i ' the body of the weal , and now , arriving a place of potency and sway o ' the state , if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii , your voices might be curses to yourselves ?
you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for , so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love , standing your friendly lord .
thus to have said , as you were , had touch his spirit and tried his inclination , from him pluck either his gracious promise , which you might , as cause had call you up , have held him to or else it would have gall his surly nature , which easily endures not article tying him to aught , so putting him to rage , you should have the advantage of his choler and pass him unelected .
did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves , and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you , when he hath power to crush ?
why , had your bodies no heart among you ?
or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment ?
have you ere now denied the asker ?
and now again of him that did not ask , but mock , bestow your tongues ?
he not confirm , we may deny him yet .
and will deny him i have five hundred voices of that sound .
i twice five hundred and their friends to piece .
get you hence instantly , and tell those friends , they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties , make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so .
let them assemble , and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election , enforce his pride , and his old hate unto you , besides , forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed , how in his suit he scorn you , but your loves , thinking upon his services , took from you the apprehension of his present portance , which most gibingly , ungravely , he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you .
lay a fault on us , your tribunes , that we laboured , no impediment between , but that you must cast your election on him .
say , you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections , and that your minds , preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should , made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us .
ay , spare us not .
say we read lectures to you .
how youngly he began to serve his country , how long continued , and what stock he springs of , the noble house o ' the marcians , from whence came that ancus marcius , numa daughter son , who , after great hostilius , here was king , of the same house publius and quintus were , that our beat water brought by conduits hither , and censorinus , nobly named so , twice being by the people chosen censor , was his great ancestor .
one thus descended , that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place , we did commend to your remembrances but you have found , scaling his present bearing with his past , that he your fixed enemy , and revoke your sudden approbation .
say , you had harp on that still but by our putting on , and presently , when you have drawn your number , repair to the capitol .
we will so almost all repent in their election .
exeunt citizens let them go on , this mutiny were better put in hazard , than stay , past doubt , for greater if , as his nature is , he fall in rage with their refusal , both observe and answer the vantage of his anger .
to the capitol , come we will be there before the stream o ' the people , and this shall seem , as partly is , their own , which we have goaded onward .

cornets .
enter coriolanus , menenius , all the gentry , cominius , titus lartius , and other senators tullus aufidius then had made new head ?
he had , my lord , and that it was which caused our swifter composition .
so then the volsces stand but as at first , ready , when time shall prompt them , to make road .
upon again .
they are worn , lord consul , so , that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again .
saw you aufidius ?
on he came to me , and did curse against the volsces , for they had so vilely yielded the town he is retired to antium .
spoke he of me ?
he did , my lord .
how ?
what ?
how often he had met you , sword to sword , that of all things upon the earth he hated your person most , that he would pawn his fortunes to hopeless restitution , so he might be call your vanquisher .
at antium lives he ?
at antium .
i wish i had a cause to seek him there , to oppose his hatred fully .
welcome home .
enter sicinius and brutus behold , these are the tribunes of the people , the tongues o ' the common mouth i do despise them , for they do prank them in authority , against all noble sufferance .
pass no further .
ha !
what is that ?
it will be dangerous to go on no further .
what makes this change ?
the matter ?
hath he not pass the noble and the common ?
cominius , no .
have i had children voices ?
tribunes , give way , he shall to the .
the people are incensed against him .
stop , or all will fall in broil .
are these your herd ?
must these have voices , that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues ?
what are your offices ?
you being their mouths , why rule you not their teeth ?
have you not set them on ?
be calm , be calm .
it is a purposed thing , and grows by plot , to curb the will of the nobility , and live with such as can not rule nor ever will be ruled .
not a plot the people cry you mock them , and of late , when corn was given them gratis , you repined , scandal the suppliants for the people , call them , flatterers , foes to nobleness .
why , this was known before .
not to them all .
have you inform them sithence ?
how !
i inform them !
you are like to do such business .
not unlike , each way , to better yours .
why then should i be consul ?
by yond clouds , let me deserve so ill as you , and make me your fellow tribune .
you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound , you must inquire your way , which you are out of , with a gentler spirit , or never be so noble as a consul , nor yoke with him for tribune .
let be calm .
the people are abused , set on .
this paltering becomes not rome , nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonour rub , laid falsely i ' the plain way of his merit .
tell me of corn !
this was my speech , and i will again not now , not now .
not in this heat , sir , now .
now , as i live , i will .
my nobler friends , i crave their pardons for the mutable , many , let them regard me as i do not flatter , and therein behold themselves i say again , in soothing them , we nourish our senate the cockle of rebellion , insolence , sedition , which we ourselves have plough for , sow , and scatter , by mingling them with us , the honour number , who lack not virtue , no , nor power , but that which they have given to beggars .
well , no more .
no more words , we beseech you .
how !
no more !
as for my country i have shed my blood , not fearing outward force , so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles , which we disdain should tatter us , yet sought the very way to catch them .
you speak o ' the people , as if you were a god to punish , not a man of their infirmity .
well we let the people .
what , what ?
his choler ?
choler !
were i as patient as the midnight sleep , by jove , be my mind !
it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is , not poison any further .
shall remain !
hear you this triton of the minnows ?
mark you his absolute ' ?
was from the canon .

o good but most unwise patricians !
why , you grave but reckless senators , have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer , that with his peremptory , ' being but the horn and noise o ' the monster , wants not spirit to say he turn your current in a ditch , and make your channel his ?
if he have power then vail your ignorance , if none , awake your dangerous lenity .
if you are learn , be not as common fools , if you are not , let them have cushions by you .
you are plebeians , if they be senators and they are no less , when , both your voices blended , the taste most palates theirs .
they choose their magistrate , and such a one as he , who puts his , ' his popular ' against a graver bench than ever frown in greece .
by jove himself !
it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know , when two authorities are up , neither supreme , how soon confusion may enter the gap of both and take the one by the other .
well , on to the .
whoever gave that counsel , to give forth the corn o ' the storehouse gratis , as was used sometime in greece , well , well , no more of that .
though there the people had more absolute power , i say , they nourish disobedience , fed the ruin of the state .
why , shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice ?
i give my reasons , more worthier than their voices .
they know the corn was not our recompense , resting well assured that did service being press to the war , even when the navel of the state was touch , they would not thread the gates .
this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis .
being i ' the war their mutinies and revolts , wherein they show most valour , spoke not for them the accusation which they have often made against the senate , all cause unborn , could never be the motive of our so frank donation .
well , what then ?
how shall this bisson multitude digest the senate courtesy ?
let deeds express what like to be their words did request it , we are the greater poll , and in true fear they gave us our demands . '
thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears , which will in time break ope the locks o ' the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles .
come , enough .
enough , with .
no , take more what may be sworn by , both divine and human , seal what i end withal !
this double worship , where one part does disdain with cause , the other insult without all reason , where gentry , title , wisdom , can not conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance , it must omit real necessities , and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barr , it follows , nothing is done to purpose .
therefore , beseech you , you that will be less fearful than discreet , that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change o , that prefer a noble life before a long , and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that sure of death without it , at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue , let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should , not having the power to do the good it would , for the in which doth .

has spoken like a traitor , and shall answer as traitors do .
thou wretch , despite thee !
what should the people do with these bald tribunes ?
on whom depending , their obedience fails to the greater bench in a rebellion , when what not meet , but what must be , was law , then were they chosen in a better hour , let what is meet be said it must be meet , and throw their power i ' the dust .
manifest treason !
this a consul ?
no .
the aediles , ho !

go , call the people exit aedile in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator , a foe to the public weal obey , i charge thee , and follow to thine answer .

or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments .

what is about to be ?
i am out of breath , confusion near , i can not speak .
you , tribunes to the people !
coriolanus , patience !
speak , good sicinius .
hear me , people , peace !
let hear our tribune peace speak , speak , speak .
you are at point to lose your liberties marcius would have all from you , marcius , whom late you have named for consul .
fie , fie , fie !
this is the way to kindle , not to quench .
to unbuild the city and to lay all flat .
what is the city but the people ?
true , the people are the city .
by the consent of all , we were establish the people magistrates .
you so remain .
and so are like to do .
that is the way to lay the city flat , to bring the roof to the foundation , and bury all , which yet distinctly ranges , in heaps and piles of ruin .
this deserves death .
or let us stand to our authority , or let us lose it .
we do here pronounce , upon the part o ' the people , in whose power we were elected theirs , marcius is worthy of present death .
therefore lay hold of him , bear him to the rock tarpeian , and from thence into destruction cast him .
aediles , seize him !
yield , marcius , yield !
hear me one word , beseech you , tribunes , hear me but a word .
peace , peace !
to brutus be that you seem , truly your country friend , and temperately proceed to what you would thus violently redress .
sir , those cold ways , that seem like prudent helps , are very poisonous where the disease is violent .
lay hands upon him , and bear him to the rock .
no , i die here .
drawing his sword there some among you have beheld me fighting come , try upon yourselves what you have seen me .
down with that sword !
tribunes , withdraw awhile .
lay hands upon him .
help marcius , help , you that be noble , help him , young and old !
down with him , down with him !
in this mutiny , the tribunes , the aediles , and the people , are beat in go , get you to your house , be gone , away !
all will be naught else .
get you gone .
stand fast , we have as many friends as enemies .
sham it be put to that ?
the gods forbid !
i prithee , noble friend , home to thy house , leave us to cure this cause .
for is a sore upon us , you can not tent yourself be gone , beseech you .
come , sir , along with us .
i would they were barbarians as they are , though in rome litter not romans as they are not , though calved i ' the porch o ' the capitol be gone , put not your worthy rage into your tongue , one time will owe another .
on fair ground i could beat forty of them .
i could myself take up a brace o ' the best of them , yea , the two tribunes but now is odds beyond arithmetic , and manhood is call foolery , when it stands against a falling fabric .
will you hence , before the tag return ?
whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and what they are used to bear .
pray you , be gone i try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patch with cloth of any colour .
nay , come away .
exeunt coriolanus , cominius , and others this man has marr his fortune .
his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident , or jove for power to thunder .
his heart his mouth what his breast forges , that his tongue must vent , and , being angry , does forget that ever he heard the name of death .
a noise within here goodly work !
i would they were abed !
i would they were in tiber !
what the vengeance !
could he not speak fair ?
brutus and sicinius , with the rabble where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself ?
you worthy tribunes , he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law , and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought .
he shall well know the noble tribunes are the people mouths , and we their hands .
he shall , sure o .
sir , sir , peace !
do not cry havoc , where you should but hunt with modest warrant .
sir , how that you have holp to make this rescue ?
hear me speak as i do know the consul worthiness , so can i name his faults , consul !
what consul ?
the consul coriolanus .
he consul !
no , no , no , no , no .
if , by the tribunes ' leave , and yours , good people , i may be heard , i would crave a word or two , the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time .
speak briefly then , for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger , and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies .
now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome , whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enroll in jove own book , like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own !
he a disease that must be cut away .
o , he a limb that has but a disease , mortal , to cut it off , to cure it , easy .
what has he done to rome that worthy death ?
killing our enemies , the blood he hath lost which , i dare vouch , is more than that he hath , by many an ounce he dropp it for his country , and what is left , to lose it by his country , were to us all , that and suffer it , a brand to the end o ' the world .
this is clean kam .
merely awry when he did love his country , it honour him .
the service of the foot being once gangrened , is not then respected for what before it was .
we hear no more .
pursue him to his house , and pluck him thence lest his infection , being of catching nature , spread further .
one word more , one word .
this rage , when it shall find the harm of unscann swiftness , will too late tie leaden pounds to heels .
proceed by process , lest parties , as he is beloved , break out , and sack great rome with romans .
if it were so , what do ye talk ?
have we not had a taste of his obedience ?
our aediles smote ?
ourselves resisted ?
come .
consider this he has been bred i ' the wars since he could draw a sword , and is ill school in bolted language , meal and bran together he throws without distinction .
give me leave , i go to him , and undertake to bring him where he shall answer , by a lawful form , in peace , to his utmost peril .
noble tribunes , it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody , and the end of it unknown to the beginning .
noble menenius , be you then as the people officer .
masters , lay down your weapons .
go not home .
meet on the .
we attend you there where , if you bring not marcius , we proceed in our first way .
i bring him to you .
to the senators let me desire your company he must come , or what is worst will follow .
pray you , let to him .
exeunt scene ii .
a room in coriolanus house .
enter coriolanus with patricians let them puff all about mine ears , present me death on the wheel or at wild horses ' heels , or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock , that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight , yet will i still be thus to them .
you do the nobler .
i muse my mother does not approve me further , who was wont to call them woollen vassals , things created to buy and sell with groats , to show bare heads in congregations , to yawn , be still and wonder , when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war .
enter volumnia i talk of you why did you wish me milder ?
would you have me false to my nature ?
rather say i play the man i am .
o , sir , sir , sir , i would have had you put your power well on , before you had worn it out .
let go .
you might have been enough the man you are , with striving less to be so , lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions , if you had not show them how ye were disposed ere they lack power to cross you .
let them hang .
ay , and burn too .
enter menenius and senators come , come , you have been too rough , something too rough , you must return and mend it .
there no remedy , unless , by not so doing , our good city cleave in the midst , and perish .
pray , be counsell i have a heart as little apt as yours , but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage .
well said , noble woman ?
before he should thus stoop to the herd , but that the violent fit o ' the time craves it as physic for the whole state , i would put mine armour on , which i can scarcely bear .
what must i do ?
return to the tribunes .
well , what then ?
what then ?
repent what you have spoke .
for them !
i can not do it to the gods , must i then to them ?
you are too absolute , though therein you can never be too noble , but when extremities speak .
i have heard you say , honour and policy , like unsever friends , i ' the war do grow together grant that , and tell me , in peace what each of them by the other lose , that they combine not there .
tush , tush !
a good demand .
if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not , which , for your best ends , you adopt your policy , how is it less or worse , that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour , as in war , since that to both it stands in like request ?
why force you this ?
because that now it lies you on to speak to the people , not by your own instruction , nor by the matter which your heart prompts you , but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue , though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom truth .
now , this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words , which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood .
i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour i am in this , your wife , your son , these senators , the nobles , and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon , for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin .
noble lady !
come , go with us , speak fair you may salve so , not what is dangerous present , but the loss of what is past .
i prithee now , my son , go to them , with this bonnet in thy hand , and thus far having stretch it here be with them thy knee bussing the stones for in such business action is eloquence , and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the ears waving thy head , which often , thus , correcting thy stout heart , now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them , thou art their soldier , and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which , thou dost confess , were fit for thee to use as they to claim , in asking their good loves , but thou wilt frame thyself , forsooth , hereafter theirs , so far as thou hast power and person .
this but done , even as she speaks , why , their hearts were yours , for they have pardons , being ask , as free as words to little purpose .
prithee now , go , and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower .
here is cominius .
enter cominius i have been i ' the , and , sir , is fit you make strong party , or defend yourself by calmness or by absence all in anger .
only fair speech .
i think serve , if he can thereto frame his spirit .
he must , and will prithee now , say you will , and go about it .
must i go show them my unbarbed sconce ?
must i with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear ?
well , i will yet , were there but this single plot to lose , this mould of marcius , they to dust should grind it and against the wind .
to the !
you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life .
come , come , we prompt you .
i prithee now , sweet son , as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier , so , to have my praise for this , perform a part thou hast not done before .
well , i must away , my disposition , and possess me some harlot spirit !
my throat of war be turn , which quired with my drum , into a pipe small as an eunuch , or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep !
the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks , and schoolboys ' tears take up the glasses of my sight !
a beggar tongue make motion through my lips , and my arm knees , who bow but in my stirrup , bend like his that hath received an alms !
i will not , lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my body action teach my mind a most inherent baseness .
at thy choice , then to beg of thee , it is my more dishonour than thou of them .
come all to ruin , let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness , for i mock at death with as big heart as thou .
do as thou list thy valiantness was mine , thou it from me , but owe thy pride thyself .
pray , be content mother , i am going to the , chide me no more .
i mountebank their loves , cog their hearts from them , and come home beloved of all the trades in rome .
look , i am going commend me to my wife .
i return consul , or never trust to what my tongue can do i ' the way of flattery further .
do your will .
exit away !
the tribunes do attend you arm yourself to answer mildly , for they are prepared with accusations , as i hear , more strong than are upon you yet .
the word is . '
pray you , let us go let them accuse me by invention , i will answer in mine honour .
ay , but mildly .
well , mildly be it then .

must all determine here ?
i do demand , if you submit you to the people voices , allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you ?
i am content .
lo , citizens , he says he is content the warlike service he has done , consider , think upon the wounds his body bears , which show like graves i ' the holy churchyard .
scratches with briers , scars to move laughter only .
consider further , that when he speaks not like a citizen , you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds , but , as i say , such as become a soldier , rather than envy you .
well , well , no more .
what is the matter that being pass for consul with full voice , i am so dishonour that the very hour you take it off again ?
answer to us .
say , then is true , i ought so .
we charge you , that you have contrived to take from rome all season office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical , for which you are a traitor to the people .
how !
traitor !
nay , temperately , your promise .

call me their traitor !
thou injurious tribune !
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths , in thy hand clutch as many millions , in thy lying tongue both numbers , i would say liest ' unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods .
mark you this , people ?
to the rock , to the rock with him !
peace !
we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak , beating your officers , cursing yourselves , opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him , even this , so criminal and in such capital kind , deserves the extremest death .
but since he hath served well for rome , what do you prate of service ?
i talk of that , that know it .
you ?
is this the promise that you made your mother ?
know , i pray you , i know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death , vagabond exile , raying , pent to linger but with a grain a day , i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word , nor cheque my courage for what they can give , to with saying morrow . '
for that he has , as much as in him lies , from time to time envied against the people , seeking means to pluck away their power , as now at last given hostile strokes , and that not in the presence of dreaded justice , but on the ministers that do distribute it , in the name o ' the people and in the power of us the tribunes , we , even from this instant , banish him our city , in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates i ' the people name , i say it shall be so .
it shall be so , it shall be so , let him away he banish , and it shall be so .
hear me , my masters , and my common friends , he sentenced , no more hearing .
let me speak i have been consul , and can show for rome her enemies ' marks upon me .
i do love my country good with a respect more tender , more holy and profound , than mine own life , my dear wife estimate , her womb increase , and treasure of my loins , then if i would speak that , we know your drift speak what ?
there no more to be said , but he is banish , as enemy to the people and his country it shall be so .
it shall be so , it shall be so .
you common cry of curs !
whose breath i hate as reek o ' the rotten fens , whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air , i banish you , and here remain with your uncertainty !
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts !
your enemies , with nodding of their plumes , fan you into despair !
have the power still to banish your defenders , till at length your ignorance , which finds not till it feels , making not reservation of yourselves , still your own foes , deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows !

i am a roman , and my services are , as you are , against know you me yet ?
nicanor ?
no .
the same , sir .
you had more beard when i last saw you , but your favour is well approved by your tongue .
what the news in rome ?
i have a note from the volscian state , to find you out there you have well saved me a day journey .
there hath been in rome strange insurrections , the people against the senators , patricians , and nobles .
hath been !
is it ended , then ?
our state thinks not so they are in a most warlike preparation , and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division .
the main blaze of it is past , but a small thing would make it flame again for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy coriolanus , that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever .
this lies glowing , i can tell you , and is almost mature for the violent breaking out .
coriolanus banished !
banished , sir .
you will be welcome with this intelligence , nicanor .
the day serves well for them now .
i have heard it said , the fittest time to corrupt a man wife is when she fallen out with her husband .
your noble tullus aufidius will appear well in these wars , his great opposer , coriolanus , being now in no request of his country .
he can not choose .
i am most fortunate , thus accidentally to encounter you you have ended my business , and i will merrily accompany you home .
i shall , between this and supper , tell you most strange things from rome , all tending to the good of their adversaries .
have you an army ready , say you ?
a most royal one , the centurions and their charges , distinctly billeted , already in the entertainment , and to be on foot at an hour warning .
i am joyful to hear of their readiness , and am the man , i think , that shall set them in present action .

exit third servingman enter aufidius with the second servingman where is this fellow ?
here , sir have beaten him like a dog , but for disturbing the lords within .
retires whence comest thou ?
what wouldst thou ?
thy name ?
why not ?
speak , man what thy name ?
if , tullus , unmuffling not yet thou knowest me , and , seeing me , dost not think me for the man i am , necessity commands me name myself .
what is thy name ?
a name unmusical to the volscians ' ears , and harsh in sound to thine .
say , what thy name ?
thou hast a grim appearance , and thy face bears a command i , though thy tackle torn .
thou a noble vessel what thy name ?
prepare thy brow to frown thou me yet ?
i know thee not thy name ?
my name is caius marcius , who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief , thereto witness may my surname , coriolanus the painful service , the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname , a good memory , and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains , the cruelty and envy of the people , permitted by our dastard nobles , who have all forsook me , hath devour the rest , and suffer me by the voice of slaves to be whoop out of rome .
now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth , not out of hope mistake me not to save my life , for if i had fear death , of all the men i ' the world i would have thee , but in mere spite , to be full quit of those my banishers , stand i before thee here .
then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee , that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country , speed thee straight , and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee , for i will fight against my canker country with the spleen of all the under fiends .
but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes tired , then , in a word , i also am longer to live most weary , and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice , which not to cut would show thee but a fool , since i have ever follow thee with hate , drawn tuns of blood out of thy country breast , and can not live but to thy shame , unless it be to do thee service .
o marcius , marcius !
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy .
if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things , and say is true , ' not believe them more than thee , all noble marcius .
let me twine mine arms about that body , where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword , and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour .
know thou first , i loved the maid i married , never man sigh truer breath , but that i see thee here , thou noble thing !
more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold .
why , thou mars !
i tell thee , we have a power on foot , and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn , or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out twelve several times , and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters thyself and me , we have been down together in my sleep , unbuckling helms , fisting each other throat , and waked half dead with nothing .
worthy marcius , had we no quarrel else to rome , but that thou art thence banish , we would muster all from twelve to seventy , and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome , like a bold flood .
o , come , go in , and take our friendly senators by the hands , who now are here , taking their leaves of me , who am prepared against your territories , though not for rome itself .
you bless me , gods !
therefore , most absolute sir , if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges , take the one half of my commission , and set down as best thou art experienced , since thou thy country strength and weakness , thine own ways , whether to knock against the gates of rome , or rudely visit them in parts remote , to fright them , ere destroy .
but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires .
a thousand welcomes !
and more a friend than an enemy , yet , marcius , that was much .
your hand most welcome !
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius .
the two servingmen come forward here a strange alteration !
by my hand , i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel , and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him .
what an arm he has !
he turned me about with his finger and his thumb , as one would set up a top .
nay , i knew by his face that there was something in him he had , sir , a kind of face , methought , i can not tell how to term it .
he had so , looking as it were would i were hanged , but i thought there was more in him than i could think .
so did i , i be sworn he is simply the rarest man i ' the world .
i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on .
who , my master ?
nay , it no matter for that .
worth six on him .
nay , not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier .
faith , look you , one can not tell how to say that for the defence of a town , our general is excellent .
ay , and for an assault too .
third servingman o slaves , i can tell you news , news , you rascals !
what , what , what ?
let partake .
i would not be a roman , of all nations , i had as lieve be a condemned man .
wherefore ?
wherefore ?
why , here he that was wont to thwack our general , caius marcius .
why do you say our general ' ?
i do not say our general , ' but he was always good enough for him .
come , we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him , i have heard him say so himself .
he was too hard for him directly , to say the troth o before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado .
an he had been cannibally given , he might have broiled and eaten him too .
but , more of thy news ?
why , he is so made on here within , as if he were son and heir to mars , set at upper end o ' the table , no question asked him by any of the senators , but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with hand and turns up the white o ' the eye to his discourse .
but the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i ' the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday , for the other has half , by the entreaty and grant of the whole table .
he go , he says , and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he will mow all down before him , and leave his passage polled .
and he as like to as any man i can imagine .
!
he will , for , look you , sir , he has as many friends as enemies , which friends , sir , as it were , durst not , look you , sir , show themselves , as we term it , his friends whilst he in directitude .
directitude !
what that ?
but when they shall see , sir , his crest up again , and the man in blood , they will out of their burrows , like conies after rain , and revel all with him .
but when goes this forward ?
, , presently , you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon is , as it were , a parcel of their feast , and to be executed ere they wipe their lips .
why , then we shall have a stirring world again .
this peace is nothing , but to rust iron , increase tailors , and breed .
let me have war , say i , it exceeds peace as far as day does night , it spritely , waking , audible , and full of vent .
peace is a very apoplexy , lethargy , mulled , deaf , sleepy , insensible , a getter of more bastard children than war a destroyer of men .
is so and as war , in some sort , may be said to be a ravisher , so it can not be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds .
ay , and it makes men hate one another .
reason , because they then less need one another .
the wars for my money .
i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians .
they are rising , they are rising .
in , in , in , in !
exeunt scene vi .
rome .
a public place .
enter sicinius and brutus we hear not of him , neither need we fear him , his remedies are tame i ' the present peace and quietness of the people , which before were in wild hurry .
here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well , who rather had , though they themselves did suffer , behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen with in their shops and going about their functions friendly .
we stood in good time .
enter menenius is this menenius ?
is he , is he o , he is grown most kind of late .
hail sir !
hail to you both !
your coriolanus is not much miss , but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand , and so would do , were he more angry at it .
all well , and might have been much better , if he could have temporized .
where is he , hear you ?
nay , i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him .
enter three or four citizens the gods preserve you both !
, our neighbours .
to you all , to you all .
ourselves , our wives , and children , on our knees , are bound to pray for you both .
live , and thrive !
farewell , kind neighbours we wish coriolanus had loved you as we did .
now the gods keep you !
farewell , farewell .
exeunt citizens this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets , crying confusion .
caius marcius was a worthy officer i ' the war , but insolent , with pride , ambitious past all thinking , , and affecting one sole throne , without assistance .
i think not so .
we should by this , to all our lamentation , if he had gone forth consul , found it so .
the gods have well prevented it , and rome sits safe and still without him .
enter an aedile worthy tribunes , there is a slave , whom we have put in prison , reports , the volsces with two several powers are enter in the roman territories , and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before .
is aufidius , who , hearing of our marcius ' banishment , thrusts forth his horns again into the world , which were inshell when marcius stood for rome , and durst not once peep out .
come , what talk you of marcius ?
go see this rumourer whipp .
it can not be the volsces dare break with us .
can not be !
we have record that very well it can , and three examples of the like have been within my age .
but reason with the fellow , before you punish him , where he heard this , lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded .
tell not me i know this can not be .
not possible .
enter a messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the some news is come that turns their countenances .
is this slave , go whip him , the people eyes his raising , nothing but his report .
yes , worthy sir , the slave report is seconded , and more , more fearful , is deliver .
what more fearful ?
it is spoke freely out of many mouths how probable i do not know that marcius , join with aufidius , leads a power rome , and vows revenge as spacious as between the and oldest thing .
this is most likely !
raised only , that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again .
the very trick o .
this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety .
enter a second messenger you are sent for to the senate a fearful army , led by caius marcius associated with aufidius , rages upon our territories , and have already their way , consumed with fire , and took what lay before them .
enter cominius o , you have made good work !
what news ?
what news ?
you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates , to see your wives dishonour to your noses , what the news ?
what the news ?
your temples burned in their cement , and your franchises , whereon you stood , confined into an auger bore .
pray now , your news ?
you have made fair work , i fear pray , your news ? if marcius should be join with volscians , if !
he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature , that shapes man better , and they follow him , against us brats , with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies , or butchers killing flies .
you have made good work , you and your , you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and the breath of !
he will shake your rome about your ears .
as hercules did shake down mellow fruit .
you have made fair work !
but is this true , sir ?
ay , and you look pale before you find it other .
all the regions do smilingly revolt , and who resist are mock for valiant ignorance , and perish constant fools .
who can blame him ?
your enemies and his find something in him .
we are all undone , unless the noble man have mercy .
who shall ask it ?
the tribunes can not for shame , the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends , if they should say good to rome , ' they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate , and therein show like enemies .
is true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it , i have not the face to say you , cease . '
you have made fair hands , you and your crafts !
you have crafted fair !
you have brought a trembling upon rome , such as was never so incapable of help .
say not we brought it .
how !
was it we ?
we loved him but , like beasts and cowardly nobles , gave way unto your clusters , who did hoot him out o ' the city .
but i fear they roar him in again .
tullus aufidius , the second name of men , obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy , strength and defence , that rome can make against them .
enter a troop of citizens here come the clusters .
and is aufidius with him ?
you are they that made the air unwholesome , when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus ' exile .
now he coming , and not a hair upon a soldier head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down , and pay you for your voices .
is no matter , if he could burn us all into one coal , we have deserved it .
faith , we hear fearful news .
for mine own part , when i said , banish him , i said was pity .
and so did i .
and so did i , and , to say the truth , so did very many of us that we did , we did for the best , and though we willingly consented to his banishment , yet it was against our will .
ye re goodly things , you voices !
you have made good work , you and your cry !
shall to the capitol ?
o , ay , what else ?
exeunt cominius and menenius go , masters , get you home , be not dismay these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear .
go home , and show no sign of fear .
the gods be good to us !
come , masters , let home .
i ever said we were i ' the wrong when we banished him .
so did we all .
but , come , let home .
exeunt citizens i do not like this news .
nor i .
let to the capitol .
would half my wealth would buy this for a lie !
pray , let us go .
exeunt scene vii .
a camp , at a small distance from rome .
enter aufidius and his lieutenant do they still fly to the roman ?
i do not know what witchcraft in him , but your soldiers use him as the grace meat , their talk at table , and their thanks at end , and you are darken in this action , sir , even by your own .
i can not help it now , unless , by using means , i lame the foot of our design .
he bears himself more proudlier , even to my person , than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in that no changeling , and i must excuse what can not be amended .
yet i wish , sir , i mean for your particular , you had not join in commission with him , but either had borne the action of yourself , or else to him had left it solely .
i understand thee well , and be thou sure , when he shall come to his account , he knows not what i can urge against him .
although it seems , and so he thinks , and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye , that he bears all things fairly .
and shows good husbandry for the volscian state , fights , and does achieve as soon as draw his sword , yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine , we come to our account .
sir , i beseech you , think you he carry rome ?
all places yield to him ere he sits down , and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers , and their people will be as rash in the repeal , as hasty to expel him thence .
i think he be to rome as is the osprey to the fish , who takes it by sovereignty of nature .
first he was a noble servant to them , but he could not carry his honours even whether was pride , which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man , whether defect of judgment , to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of , or whether nature , not to be other than one thing , not moving from the casque to the cushion , but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll the war , but one of these as he hath spices of them all , not all , for i dare so far free him made him fear , so hated , and so banish but he has a merit , to choke it in the utterance .
so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time and power , unto itself most commendable , hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done .
one fire drives out one fire , one nail , one nail , rights by rights falter , strengths by strengths do fail .
come , let away .
when , caius , rome is thine , thou art of all , then shortly art thou mine .
exeunt act v scene rome .
a public place .
enter menenius , cominius , sicinius , brutus , and others no , i not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general , who loved him in a most dear particular .
he call me father but what o ' that ?
go , you that banish him , a mile before his tent fall down , and knee the way into his mercy nay , if he coy to hear cominius speak , i keep at home .
he would not seem to know me .
do you hear ?
yet one time he did call me by my name i urged our old acquaintance , and the drops that we have bled together .
coriolanus he would not answer to forbad all names , he was a kind of nothing , titleless , till he had forged himself a name o ' the fire of burning rome .
why , so you have made good work !
a pair of tribunes that have rack for rome , to make coals cheap , a noble memory !
i minded him how royal was to pardon when it was less expected he replied , it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punish .
very well could he say less ?
i offer to awaken his regard for private friends his answer to me was , he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said was folly , for one poor grain or two , to leave unburnt , and still to nose the offence .
for one poor grain or two !
i am one of those , his mother , wife , his child , and this brave fellow too , we are the grains you are the musty chaff , and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you .
nay , pray , be patient if you refuse your aid in this so help , yet do not upbraid with our distress .
but , sure , if you would be your country pleader , your good tongue , more than the instant army we can make , might stop our countryman .
no , i not meddle .
pray you , go to him .
what should i do ?
only make trial what your love can do for rome , towards marcius .
well , and say that marcius return me , as cominius is return , unheard , what then ?
but as a discontented friend , with his unkindness ?
be so ?
yet your good will must have that thanks from rome , after the measure as you intended well .
i undertake i think he hear me .
yet , to bite his lip and hum at good cominius , much unhearts me .
he was not taken well , he had not dined the veins unfill , our blood is cold , and then we pout upon the morning , are unapt to give or to forgive , but when we have stuff these and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding , we have suppler souls than in our fasts therefore i watch him till he be dieted to my request , and then i set upon him .
you know the very road into his kindness , and can not lose your way .
good faith , i prove him , speed how it will .
i shall ere long have knowledge of my success .
exit he never hear him .
not ?
i tell you , he does sit in gold , his eye red as burn rome , and his injury the gaoler to his pity .
i kneel before him , was very faintly he said , ' dismiss me thus , with his speechless hand what he would do , he sent in writing after me , what he would not , bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain .
unless his noble mother , and his wife , who , as i hear , mean to solicit him for mercy to his country .
therefore , let hence , and with our fair entreaties haste them on .
exeunt scene ii .
entrance of the volscian camp before rome .
two sentinels on guard .
enter to them , menenius stay whence are you ?
stand , and go back .
you guard like men , is well but , by your leave , i am an officer of state , and come to speak with coriolanus .
from whence ?
from rome .
you may not pass , you must return our general will no more hear from thence .
you see your rome embraced with fire before you speak with coriolanus .
good my friends , if you have heard your general talk of rome , and of his friends there , it is lots to blanks , my name hath touch your ears it is menenius .
be it so , go back the virtue of your name is not here passable .
i tell thee , fellow , the general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts , whence men have read his name unparallel , haply amplified , for i have ever verified my friends , of whom he chief , with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay , sometimes , like to a bowl upon a subtle ground , i have tumbled past the throw , and in his praise have almost stamp the leasing therefore , fellow , i must have leave to pass .
faith , sir , if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own , you should not pass here , no , though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely .
therefore , go back .
prithee , fellow , remember my name is menenius , always factionary on the party of your general .
howsoever you have been his liar , as you say you have , i am one that , telling true under him , must say , you can not pass .
therefore , go back .
has he dined , canst thou tell ?
for i would not speak with him till after dinner .
you are a roman , are you ?
i am , as thy general is .
then you should hate rome , as he does .
can you , when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them , and , in a violent popular ignorance , given your enemy your shield , think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women , the virginal palms of your daughters , or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be ?
can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in , with such weak breath as this ?
no , you are deceived , therefore , back to rome , and prepare for your execution you are condemned , our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon .
sirrah , if thy captain knew i were here , he would use me with estimation .
come , my captain knows you not .
i mean , thy general .
my general cares not for you .
back , i say , go , lest i let forth your of blood , back , that the utmost of your having back .
nay , but , fellow , fellow , enter coriolanus and aufidius what the matter ?
now , you companion , i say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation , you shall perceive that a jack guardant can not office me from my son coriolanus guess , but by my entertainment with him , if thou standest not i ' the state of hanging , or of some death more long in spectatorship , and crueller in suffering , behold now presently , and swoon for what to come upon thee .
to coriolanus the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity , and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does !
o my son , my son !
thou art preparing fire for us , look thee , here water to quench it .
i was hardly moved to come to thee , but being assured none but myself could move thee , i have been blown out of your gates with sighs , and conjure thee to pardon rome , and thy petitionary countrymen .
the good gods assuage thy wrath , and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here , this , who , like a block , hath denied my access to thee .
away !
how !
away !
wife , mother , child , i know not .
my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly , my remission lies in volscian breasts .
that we have been familiar , ingrate forgetfulness shall poison , rather than pity note how much .
therefore , be gone .
mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force .
yet , for i loved thee , take this along , i writ it for thy sake gives a letter and would have rent it .
another word , menenius , i will not hear thee speak .
this man , aufidius , was my beloved in rome yet thou !
you keep a constant temper .
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius now , sir , is your name menenius ?
is a spell , you see , of much power you know the way home again .
do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back ?
what cause , do you think , i have to swoon ?
i neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you , i can scarce think there any , ye so slight .
he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst .
for you , be that you are , long , and your misery increase with your age !
i say to you , as i was said to , away !
exit a noble fellow , i warrant him .
the worthy fellow is our general he the rock , the oak not to be .
exeunt scene iii .
the tent of coriolanus .
enter coriolanus , aufidius , and others we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host .
my partner in this action , you must report to the volscian lords , how plainly i have borne this business .
only their ends you have respected , stopp your ears against the general suit of rome , never admitted a private whisper , no , not with such friends that thought them sure of you .
this last old man , whom with a crack heart i have sent to rome , loved me above the measure of a father , nay , godded me , indeed .
their latest refuge was to send him , for whose old love i have , though i show sourly to him , once more offer the first conditions , which they did refuse and can not now accept , to grace him only that thought he could do more , a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits , nor from the state nor private friends , hereafter will i lend ear to .
ha !
what shout is this ?
shout within shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time is made ?
i will not .
enter in mourning habits , virgilia , volumnia , leading young marcius , valeria , and attendants my wife comes foremost , then the honour mould wherein this trunk was framed , and in her hand the grandchild to her blood .
but , out , affection !
all bond and privilege of nature , break !
let it be virtuous to be obstinate .
what is that worth ?
or those doves ' eyes , which can make gods forsworn ?
i melt , and am not of stronger earth than others .
my mother bows , as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession , which great nature cries not . '
let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy i never be such a gosling to obey instinct , but stand , as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin .
my lord and husband !
these eyes are not the same i wore in rome .
the sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so .
like a dull actor now , i have forgot my part , and i am out , even to a full disgrace .
best of my flesh , forgive my tyranny , but do not say for that our romans . '
o , a kiss long as my exile , sweet as my revenge !
now , by the jealous queen of heaven , that kiss i carried from thee , dear , and my true lip hath virgin it since .
you gods !
i prate , and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink , my knee , i ' the earth , kneels of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons .
o , stand up blest !
whilst , with no softer cushion than the flint , i kneel before thee , and unproperly show duty , as mistaken all this while between the child and parent .
kneels what is this ?
your knees to me ?
to your corrected son ?
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars , then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars the fiery sun , murdering impossibility , to make what can not be , slight work .
thou art my warrior , i holp to frame thee .
do you know this lady ?
the noble sister of publicola , the moon of rome , chaste as the icicle that curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dian temple dear valeria !
this is a poor epitome of yours , which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself .
the god of soldiers , with the consent of supreme jove , inform thy thoughts with nobleness , that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable , and stick i ' the wars like a great , standing every flaw , and saving those that eye thee !
your knee , sirrah .
that my brave boy !
even he , your wife , this lady , and myself , are suitors to you .
i beseech you , peace or , if ask , remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials .
do not bid me dismiss my soldiers , or capitulate again with rome mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not to ally my rages and revenges with your colder reasons .
o , no more , no more !
you have said you will not grant us any thing , for we have nothing else to ask , but that which you deny already yet we will ask , that , if you fail in our request , the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us .
aufidius , and you volsces , mark , for we hear nought from rome in private .
your request ?
should we be silent and not speak , our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile .
think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight , which should make our eyes flow with joy , hearts dance with comforts , constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow , making the mother , wife and child to see the son , the husband and the father tearing his country bowels out .
and to poor we thine enmity most capital thou us our prayers to the gods , which is a comfort that all but we enjoy , for how can we , alas , how can we for our country pray .
whereto we are bound , together with thy victory , whereto we are bound ?
alack , or we must lose the country , our dear nurse , or else thy person , our comfort in the country .
we must find an evident calamity , though we had our wish , which side should win for either thou must , as a foreign recreant , be led with manacles thorough our streets , or else triumphantly tread on thy country ruin , and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children blood .
for myself , son , i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i can not persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one , thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread trust , thou shalt not on thy mother womb , that brought thee to this world .
ay , and mine , that brought you forth this boy , to keep your name living to time .
a ' shall not tread on me , i run away till i am bigger , but then i fight .
not of a woman tenderness to be , requires nor child nor woman face to see .
i have sat too long .
rising nay , go not from us thus .
if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans , thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve , you might condemn us , as poisonous of your honour no , our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say mercy we have show , ' the romans , we received , ' and each in either side give the to thee and cry blest for making up this peace ! '
thou , great son , the end of war uncertain , but this certain , that , if thou conquer rome , the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name , whose repetition will be dogg with curses , whose chronicle thus writ man was noble , but with his last attempt he wiped it out , destroy his country , and his name remains to the ensuing age abhorr . '
speak to me , son thou hast affected the fine strains of honour , to imitate the graces of the gods , to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o ' the air , and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak .
why dost not speak ?
thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs ?
daughter , speak you he cares not for your weeping .
speak thou , boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons .
there no man in the world more bound to mother , yet here he lets me prate like one i ' the stocks .
thou hast never in thy life show thy dear mother any courtesy , when she , poor hen , fond of no second brood , has cluck thee to the wars and safely home , loaden with honour .
say my request unjust , and spurn me back but if it be not so , thou art not honest , and the gods will plague thee , that thou from me the duty which to a mother part belongs .
he turns away down , ladies , let us shame him with our knees .
to his surname coriolanus more pride than pity to our prayers .
down an end , this is the last so we will home to rome , and die among our neighbours .
nay , behold this boy , that can not tell what he would have but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship , does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny .
come , let us go this fellow had a volscian to his mother , his wife is in corioli and his child like him by chance .
yet give us our dispatch i am hush until our city be , and then i speak a little .
he holds her by the hand , silent o mother , mother !
what have you done ?
behold , the heavens do ope , the gods look down , and this unnatural scene they laugh at .
o my mother , mother !
o !
you have won a happy victory to rome , but , for your son , believe it , o , believe it , most dangerously you have with him prevail , if not most mortal to him .
but , let it come .
aufidius , though i can not make true wars , i frame convenient peace .
now , good aufidius , were you in my stead , would you have heard a mother less ?
or granted less , aufidius ?
i was moved withal .
i dare be sworn you were and , sir , it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion .
but , good sir , what peace you make , advise me for my part , i not to rome , i back with you , and pray you , stand to me in this cause .
o mother !
wife !
aside i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour at difference in thee out of that i work myself a former fortune .
the ladies make signs to coriolanus ay , by and by , to volumnia , virgilia , and c but we will drink together , and you shall bear a better witness back than words , which we , on like conditions , will have .
come , enter with us .
ladies , you deserve to have a temple built you all the swords in italy , and her confederate arms , could not have made this peace .
exeunt scene iv .
rome .
a public place .
enter menenius and sicinius see you yond coign o ' the capitol , yond ?
why , what of that ?
if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger , there is some hope the ladies of rome , especially his mother , may prevail with him .
but i say there is no hope i our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution .
possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man !
there is differency between a grub and a butterfly , yet your butterfly was a grub .
this marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings , he more than a creeping thing .
he loved his mother dearly .
so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an horse .
the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks , he moves like an engine , and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye , talks like a knell , and his hum is a battery .
he sits in his state , as a thing made for alexander .
what he bids be done is finished with his bidding .
he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in .
yes , mercy , if you report him truly .
i paint him in the character .
mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger , that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you .
the gods be good unto us !
no , in such a case the gods will not be good unto us .
when we banished him , we respected not them , and , he returning to break our necks , they respect not us .
enter a messenger sir , if save your life , fly to your house the plebeians have got your and hale him up and down , all swearing , if the roman ladies bring not comfort home , they give him death by inches .
enter a second messenger what the news ?
good news , good news , the ladies have prevail , the volscians are dislodged , and marcius gone a merrier day did never yet greet rome , no , not the expulsion of the tarquins .
friend , art thou certain this is true ?
is it most certain ?
as certain as i know the sun is fire where have you lurk , that you make doubt of it ?
through an arch so hurried the blown tide , as the recomforted through the gates .
why , hark you !
trumpets , hautboys , drums beat , all together the trumpets , sackbuts , psalteries and fifes , tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans , make the sun dance .
hark you !
a shout within this is good news i will go meet the ladies .
this volumnia is worth of consuls , senators , patricians , a city full , of tribunes , such as you , a sea and land full .

music still , with shouts first , the gods bless you for your tidings , next , accept my thankfulness .
sir , we have all great cause to give great thanks .
they are near the city ?
almost at point to enter .
we will meet them , and help the joy .
exeunt scene the same .
a street near the gate .
enter two senators with volumnia , virgilia , valeria , and passing over the stage , followed by patricians and others behold our patroness , the life of rome !
call all your tribes together , praise the gods , and make triumphant fires , strew flowers before them unshout the noise that banish marcius , repeal him with the welcome of his mother , cry , ladies , welcome ! '

enter tullus aufidius , with attendants go tell the lords o ' the city i am here deliver them this paper having read it , bid them repair to the market place , where i , even in theirs and in the commons ' ears , will vouch the truth of it .
him i accuse the city ports by this hath enter and intends to appear before the people , hoping to purge herself with words dispatch .
exeunt attendants enter three or four conspirators of aufidius ' faction most welcome !
how is it with our general ?
even so as with a man by his own alms empoison , and with his charity slain .
most noble sir , if you do hold the same intent wherein you wish us parties , we deliver you of your great danger .
sir , i can not tell we must proceed as we do find the people .
the people will remain uncertain whilst you there difference , but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all .
i know it , and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction .
i raised him , and i pawn mine honour for his truth who being so heighten , he water his new plants with dews of flattery , seducing so my friends , and , to this end , he bow his nature , never known before but to be rough , unswayable and free .
sir , his stoutness when he did stand for consul , which he lost by lack of stooping , that i would have spoke of being banish , he came unto my hearth , presented to my knife his throat i took him , made him with me , gave him way in all his own desires , nay , let him choose out of my files , his projects to accomplish , my best and freshest men , served his designments in mine own person , holp to reap the fame which he did end all his , and took some pride to do myself this wrong till , at the last , i seem his follower , not partner , and he waged me with his countenance , as if i had been mercenary .
so he did , my lord the army marvell at it , and , in the last , when he had carried rome and that we look for no less spoil than glory , there was it for which my sinews shall be stretch upon him .
at a few drops of women rheum , which are as cheap as lies , he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die , and i renew me in his fall .
but , hark !
drums and trumpets sound , with great shouts of the people your native town you enter like a post , and had no welcomes home but he returns , splitting the air with noise .
and patient fools , whose children he hath slain , their base throats tear with giving him glory .
therefore , at your vantage , ere he express himself , or move the people with what he would say , let him feel your sword , which we will second .
when he lies along , after your way his tale pronounced shall bury his reasons with his body .
say no more here come the lords .
enter the lords of the city you are most welcome home .
i have not deserved it .
but , worthy lords , have you with heed perused what i have written to you ?
we have .
and grieve to .
what faults he made before the last , i think might have found easy fines but there to end where he was to begin and give away the benefit of our levies , answering us with our own charge , making a treaty where there was a yielding , this admits no excuse .
he approaches you shall hear him .
enter coriolanus , marching with drum and colours , commoners being with him hail , lords !
i am return your soldier , no more infected with my country love than when i parted hence , but still subsisting under your great command .
you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome .
our spoils we have brought home do more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action .
we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates than shame to the romans and we here deliver , subscribed by the consuls and patricians , together with the seal o ' the senate , what we have compounded on .
read it not , noble lords , but tell the traitor , in the degree he hath abused your powers .
traitor !
how now !
ay , traitor , marcius !
marcius !
ay , marcius , caius marcius dost thou think i grace thee with that robbery , thy name coriolanus in corioli ?
you lords and heads o ' the state , perfidiously he has betray your business , and given up , for certain drops of salt , your city rome , i say city , ' to his wife and mother , breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk , never admitting counsel o ' the war , but at his nurse tears he whined and roar away your victory , that pages blush at him and men of heart look wondering each at other .
thou , mars ?
name not the god , thou boy of tears !
ha !
no more .
measureless liar , thou hast made my heart too great for what contains it .
boy !
o slave !
pardon me , lords , is the first time that ever i was forced to scold .
your judgments , my grave lords , must give this cur the lie and his own notion who wears my stripes impress upon him , that must bear my beating to his grave shall join to thrust the lie unto him .
peace , both , and hear me speak .
cut me to pieces , volsces , men and lads , stain all your edges on me .
boy !
false hound !
if you have writ your annals true , is there , that , like an eagle in a , i flutter your volscians in corioli alone i did it .
boy !
why , noble lords , will you be put in mind of his blind fortune , which was your shame , by this unholy braggart , your own eyes and ears ?
let him die .

kill my son . '
daughter . '
killed my cousin marcus . '
killed my father . '
peace , ho !
no outrage peace !
the man is noble and his fame this orb o ' the earth .
his last offences to us shall have judicious hearing .
stand , aufidius , and trouble not the peace .
o that i had him , with six aufidiuses , or more , his tribe , to use my lawful sword !
insolent villain !
kill , kill , kill , kill , kill him !
the conspirators draw , and kill coriolanus aufidius stands on his body hold , hold , hold , hold !
my noble masters , hear me speak .
o tullus , thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep .
tread not upon him .
masters all , be quiet , put up your swords .
my lords , when you shall know as in this rage , provoked by him , you can not the great danger which this man life did owe you , you rejoice that he is thus cut off .
please it your honours to call me to your senate , i deliver myself your loyal servant , or endure your heaviest censure .
bear from hence his body , and mourn you for him let him be regarded as the most noble corse that ever herald did follow to his urn .
his own impatience takes from aufidius a great part of blame .
let make the best of it .
my rage is gone , and i am struck with sorrow .
take him up .
help , three o ' the chiefest soldiers , i be one .
beat thou the drum , that it speak mournfully trail your steel pikes .
though in this city he hath widow and unchilded many a one , which to this hour bewail the injury , yet he shall have a noble memory .

a dead march sounded act i scene britain .
the garden of cymbeline palace .
enter two gentlemen you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods no more obey the heavens than our courtiers still seem as does the king .
but what the matter ?
his daughter , and the heir of kingdom , whom he purposed to his wife sole son a widow that late he married hath referr herself unto a poor but worthy gentleman she wedded , her husband banish , she imprison all is outward sorrow , though i think the king be touch at very heart .
none but the king ?
he that hath lost her too , so is the queen , that most desired the match , but not a courtier , although they wear their faces to the bent of the king look , hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at .
and why so ?
he that hath miss the princess is a thing too bad for bad report and he that hath her i mean , that married her , alack , good man !
and therefore banish is a creature such as , to seek through the regions of the earth for one his like , there would be something failing in him that should compare .
i do not think so fair an outward and such stuff within endows a man but he .
you speak him far .
i do extend him , sir , within himself , crush him together rather than unfold his measure duly .
what his name and birth ?
i can not delve him to the root his father was call sicilius , who did join his honour against the romans with cassibelan , but had his titles by tenantius whom he served with glory and admired success , so gain the leonatus , and had , besides this gentleman in question , two other sons , who in the wars o ' the time died with their swords in hand , for which their father , then old and fond of issue , took such sorrow that he quit being , and his gentle lady , big of this gentleman our theme , deceased as he was born .
the king he takes the babe to his protection , calls him posthumus leonatus , breeds him and makes him of his , puts to him all the learnings that his time could make him the receiver of , which he took , as we do air , fast as was minister , and in spring became a harvest , lived in court which rare it is to do most praised , most loved , a sample to the youngest , to the more mature a glass that feated them , and to the graver a child that guided dotards , to his mistress , for whom he now is banish , her own price proclaims how she esteem him and his virtue , by her election may be truly read what kind of man he is .
i honour him even out of your report .
but , pray you , tell me , is she sole child to the king ?
his only child .
he had two sons if this be worth your hearing , mark it the eldest of them at three years old , i ' the the other , from their nursery were , and to this hour no guess in knowledge which way they went .
how long is this ago ?
some twenty years .
that a king children should be so convey , so slackly guarded , and the search so slow , that could not trace them !
is strange , or that the negligence may well be laugh at , yet is it true , sir .
i do well believe you .
we must forbear here comes the gentleman , the queen , and princess .
exeunt enter the queen , posthumus leonatus , and imogen no , be assured you shall not find me , daughter , after the slander of most stepmothers , unto you you my prisoner , but your gaoler shall deliver you the keys that lock up your restraint .
for you , posthumus , so soon as i can win the offended king , i will be known your advocate marry , yet the fire of rage is in him , and good you lean unto his sentence with what patience your wisdom may inform you .
please your highness , i will from hence .
you know the peril .
i fetch a turn about the garden , pitying the pangs of barr affections , though the king hath charged you should not speak together .
exit o dissembling courtesy !
how fine this tyrant can tickle where she wounds !
my dearest husband , i something fear my father wrath , but nothing always reserved my holy duty what his rage can do on me you must be gone , and i shall here abide the hourly shot of angry eyes , not comforted to live , but that there is this jewel in the world that i may see again .
my queen !
my mistress !
o lady , weep no more , lest i give cause to be suspected of more tenderness than doth become a man .
i will remain the husband that did plight troth my residence in rome at one philario , who to my father was a friend , to me known but by letter thither write , my queen , and with mine eyes i drink the words you send , though ink be made of gall .
queen be brief , i pray you if the king come , i shall incur i know not how much of his displeasure .
aside yet i move him to walk this way i never do him wrong , but he does buy my injuries , to be friends , pays dear for my offences .
exit should we be taking leave as long a term as yet we have to live , the loathness to depart would grow .
adieu !
nay , stay a little were you but riding forth to air yourself , such parting were too petty .
look here , love , this diamond was my mother take it , heart , but keep it till you woo another wife , when imogen is dead .
how , how !
another ?
you gentle gods , give me but this i have , and sear up my embracements from a next with bonds of death !
putting on the ring remain , remain thou here while sense can keep it on .
and , sweetest , fairest , as i my poor self did exchange for you , to your so infinite loss , so in our trifles i still win of you for my sake wear this , it is a manacle of love , i place it upon this fairest prisoner .

when shall we see again ?

i am gone .
exit there can not be a pinch in death more sharp than this is .
o disloyal thing , that shouldst repair my youth , thou a year age on me .
i beseech you , sir , harm not yourself with your vexation i am senseless of your wrath , a touch more rare subdues all pangs , all fears .
past grace ?
obedience ?
past hope , and in despair , that way , past grace .
that mightst have had the sole son of my queen !
o blest , that i might not !
i chose an eagle , and did avoid a puttock .
thou a beggar , wouldst have made my throne a seat for baseness .
no , i rather added a lustre to it .
o thou vile one !
sir , it is your fault that i have loved posthumus you bred him as my playfellow , and he is a man worth any woman , overbuys me almost the sum he pays .
what , art thou mad ?
almost , sir heaven restore me !
would i were a daughter , and my leonatus our neighbour shepherd son !
thou foolish thing !
queen they were again together you have done not after our command .
away with her , and pen her up .
beseech your patience .
peace , dear lady daughter , peace !
sweet sovereign , leave us to ourselves , and make yourself some comfort out of your best advice .
nay , let her languish a drop of blood a day , and , being aged , die of this folly !

i am very glad o .
your son my father friend , he takes his part .
to draw upon an exile !
o brave sir !
i would they were in afric both together , myself by with a needle , that i might prick the .
why came you from your master ?
on his command he would not suffer me to bring him to the haven , left these notes of what commands i should be subject to , when pleased you to employ me .
this hath been your faithful servant i dare lay mine honour he will remain so .

enter cloten and two lords sir , i would advise you to shift a shirt , the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice where air comes out , air comes in there none abroad so wholesome as that you vent .
if my shirt were bloody , then to shift it .
have i hurt him ?
aside no , , not so much as his patience .
hurt him !
his body a passable carcass , if he be not hurt it is a thoroughfare for steel , if it be not hurt .
aside his steel was in debt , it went o ' the backside the town .
the villain would not stand me .
aside no , but he fled forward still , toward your face .
stand you !
you have land enough of your own but he added to your having , gave you some ground .
aside as many inches as you have oceans .
puppies !
i would they had not come between us .
aside so would i , till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the ground .
and that she should love this fellow and refuse me !
aside if it be a sin to make a true election , she is damned .
sir , as i told you always , her beauty and her brain go not together she a good sign , but i have seen small reflection of her wit .
aside she shines not upon fools , lest the reflection should hurt her .
come , i to my chamber .
would there had been some hurt done !
aside i wish not so , unless it had been the fall of an ass , which is no great hurt .
you go with us ?
i attend your lordship .
nay , come , let go together .
well , my lord .
exeunt scene iii .
a room in cymbeline palace .
enter imogen and pisanio i would thou unto the shores o ' the haven , and every sail if he should write and not have it , a paper lost , as offer mercy is .
what was the last that he spake to thee ?
it was his queen , his queen !
then waved his handkerchief ?
and kiss it , madam .
senseless linen !
happier therein than i !
and that was all ?
no , madam , for so long as he could make me with this eye or ear distinguish him from others , he did keep the deck , with glove , or hat , or handkerchief , still waving , as the fits and stirs of mind could best express how slow his soul sail on , how swift his ship .
thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow , or less , ere left to him .
madam , so i did .
i would have broke mine , crack them , but to look upon him , till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle , nay , follow him , till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air , and then have turn mine eye and wept .
but , good pisanio , when shall we hear from him ?
be assured , madam , with his next vantage .
i did not take my leave of him , but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such , or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honour , or have charged him , at the sixth hour of morn , at noon , at midnight , to encounter me with orisons , for then i am in heaven for him , or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words , comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all our buds from growing .
enter a lady the queen , madam , desires your highness ' company .
those things i bid you do , get them dispatch .
i will attend the queen .
madam , i shall .
exeunt scene iv .
rome .
philario house .
enter philario , iachimo , a frenchman , a dutchman , and a spaniard believe it , sir , i have seen him in britain he was then of a crescent note , expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of , but i could then have looked on him without the help of admiration , though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items .
you speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within .
i have seen him in france we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he .
this matter of marrying his king daughter , wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own , words him , i doubt not , a great deal from the matter .
and then his banishment .
ay , and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him , be it but to fortify her judgment , which else an easy battery might lay flat , for taking a beggar without less quality .
but how comes it he is to sojourn with you ?
how creeps acquaintance ?
his father and i were soldiers together , to whom i have been often bound for no less than my life .
here comes the briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits , with gentlemen of your knowing , to a stranger of his quality .
enter posthumus leonatus i beseech you all , be better known to this gentleman , whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear hereafter , rather than story him in his own hearing .
sir , we have known together in orleans .
since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies , which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still .
sir , you my poor kindness i was glad i did atone my countryman and you , it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore , upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature .
by your pardon , sir , i was then a young traveller , rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others ' experiences but upon my mended judgment if i offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight .
, yes , to be put to the arbitrement of swords , and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other , or have fallen both .
can we , with manners , ask what was the difference ?
safely , i think was a contention in public , which may , without contradiction , suffer the report .
it was much like an argument that fell out last night , where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses , this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair , virtuous , wise , chaste , and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france .
that lady is not now living , or this gentleman opinion by this worn out .
she holds her virtue still and i my mind .
you must not so far prefer her ours of italy .
being so far provoked as i was in france , i would abate her nothing , though i profess myself her adorer , not her friend .
as fair and as good a kind of comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain .
if she went before others i have seen , as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld .
i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is , nor you the lady .
i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone .
what do you esteem it at ?
more than the world enjoys .
either your unparagoned mistress is dead , or she outprized by a trifle .
you are mistaken the one may be sold , or given , if there were wealth enough for the purchase , or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale , and only the gift of the gods .
which the gods have given you ?
which , by their graces , i will keep .
you may wear her in title yours but , you know , strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds .
your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable estimations , the one is but frail and the other casual , a cunning thief , or a that way accomplished courtier , would hazard the winning both of first and last .
your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress , if , in the holding or loss of that , you term her frail .
i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves , notwithstanding , i fear not my ring .
let us leave here , gentlemen .
sir , with all my heart .
this worthy signior , i thank him , makes no stranger of me , we are familiar at first .
with five times so much conversation , i should get ground of your fair mistress , make her go back , even to the yielding , had i admittance and opportunity to friend .
no , no .
i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring , which , in my opinion , it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and , to bar your offence herein too , i durst attempt it against any lady in the world .
you are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion , and i doubt not you sustain what you worthy of by your attempt .
what that ?
a repulse though your attempt , as you call it , deserve more , a punishment too .
gentlemen , enough of this it came in too suddenly , let it die as it was born , and , i pray you , be better acquainted .
would i had put my estate and my neighbour on the approbation of what i have spoke !
what lady would you choose to assail ?
yours , whom in constancy you think stands so safe .
i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring , that , commend me to the court where your lady is , with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference , and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved .
i will wage against your gold , gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger , is part of it .
you are afraid , and therein the wiser .
if you buy ladies ' flesh at a million a dram , you can not preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you , that you fear .
this is but a custom in your tongue , you bear a graver purpose , i hope .
i am the master of my speeches , and would undergo what spoken , i swear .
will you ?
i shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn between my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here my ring .
i will have it no lay .
by the gods , it is one .
if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress , my ten thousand ducats are yours , so is your diamond too if i come off , and leave her in such honour as you have trust in , she your jewel , this your jewel , and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment .
i embrace these conditions , let us have articles betwixt us .
only , thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevailed , i am no further your enemy , she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduced , you not making it appear otherwise , for your ill opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword .
your hand , a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel , and straight away for britain , lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded .
agreed .
exeunt posthumus leonatus and iachimo will this hold , think you ?
signior iachimo will not from it .
pray , let us follow .
exeunt scene britain .
a room in cymbeline palace .
enter queen , ladies , and cornelius whiles yet the dew on ground , gather those flowers , make haste who has the note of them ?
i , madam .
dispatch .
exeunt ladies now , master doctor , have you brought those drugs ?
pleaseth your highness , ay here they are , madam presenting a small box but i beseech your grace , without offence , my conscience bids me ask wherefore you have commanded of me those most poisonous compounds , which are the movers of a languishing death , but though slow , deadly ?
i wonder , doctor , thou me such a question .
have i not been thy pupil long ?
hast thou not learn me how to make perfumes ?
distil ?
preserve ?
yea , so that our great king himself doth woo me oft for my confections ?
having thus far proceeded , unless thou me devilish not meet that i did amplify my judgment in other conclusions ?
i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging , but none human , to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act , and by them gather their several virtues and effects .
your highness shall from this practise but make hard your heart besides , the seeing these effects will be both noisome and infectious .
o , content thee .
enter pisanio aside here comes a flattering rascal , upon him will i first work he for his master , an enemy to my son .
how now , pisanio !
doctor , your service for this time is ended , take your own way .
aside i do suspect you , madam , but you shall do no harm .
to pisanio hark thee , a word .
aside i do not like her .
she doth think she has strange lingering poisons i do know her spirit , and will not trust one of her malice with a drug of such damn nature .
those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile , which first , perchance , she prove on cats and dogs , then afterward up higher but there is no danger in what show of death it makes , more than the the spirits a time , to be more fresh , reviving .
she is fool with a most false effect , and i the truer , so to be false with her .
no further service , doctor , until i send for thee .
i humbly take my leave .
exit weeps she still , thou ?
dost thou think in time she will not quench and let instructions enter where folly now possesses ?
do thou work when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son , i tell thee on the instant thou art then as great as is thy master , greater , for his fortunes all lie speechless and his name is at last gasp return he can not , nor continue where he is to shift his being is to exchange one misery with another , and every day that comes comes to decay a day work in him .
what shalt thou expect , to be depender on a thing that leans , who can not be new built , nor has no friends , so much as but to prop him ?
the queen drops the box pisanio takes it up thou takest up thou not what , but take it for thy labour it is a thing i made , which hath the king five times redeem from death i do not know what is more cordial .
nay , i prethee , take it , it is an earnest of a further good that i mean to thee .
tell thy mistress how the case stands with her , as from thyself .
think what a chance thou changest on , but think thou hast thy mistress still , to boot , my son , who shall take notice of thee i move the king to any shape of thy preferment such as desire , and then myself , i chiefly , that set thee on to this desert , am bound to load thy merit richly .

exit scene vi .
the same .
another room in the palace .
enter imogen a father cruel , and a false , a foolish suitor to a wedded lady , that hath her husband banish , o , that husband !
my supreme crown of grief !
and those repeated vexations of it !
had i been , as my two brothers , happy !
but most miserable is the desire that glorious blest be those , how mean , that have their honest wills , which seasons comfort .
who may this be ?
fie !
enter pisanio and iachimo madam , a noble gentleman of rome , comes from my lord with letters .
change you , madam ?
the worthy leonatus is in safety and greets your highness dearly .
presents a letter thanks , good sir you kindly welcome .
aside all of her that is out of door most rich !
if she be furnish with a mind so rare , she is alone the arabian bird , and i have lost the wager .
boldness be my friend !
arm me , audacity , from head to foot !
or , like the parthian , i shall flying fight , rather directly fly .
reads is one of the noblest note , to whose kindnesses i am most infinitely tied .
reflect upon him accordingly , as you value your trust leonatus . '
so far i read aloud but even the very middle of my heart is warm by the rest , and takes it thankfully .
you are as welcome , worthy sir , as i have words to bid you , and shall find it so in all that i can do .
thanks , fairest lady .
what , are men mad ?
hath nature given them eyes to see this vaulted arch , and the rich crop of sea and land , which can distinguish the fiery orbs above and the twinn stones upon the number beach ?
and can we not partition make with spectacles so precious fair and foul ?
what makes your admiration ?
it can not be i ' the eye , for apes and monkeys two such shes would chatter this way and contemn with mows the other , nor i ' the judgment , for idiots in this case of favour would be wisely definite , nor i ' the appetite , sluttery to such neat excellence opposed should make desire vomit emptiness , not so allured to feed .
what is the matter , trow ?
the cloyed will , that satiate yet unsatisfied desire , that tub both fill and running , ravening first the lamb longs after for the garbage .
what , dear sir , thus raps you ?
are you well ?
thanks , madam , well .
to pisanio beseech you , sir , desire my man abode where i did leave him he is strange and peevish .
i was going , sir , to give him welcome .
exit continues well my lord ?
his health , beseech you ?
well , madam .
is he disposed to mirth ?
i hope he is .
exceeding pleasant , none a stranger there so merry and so gamesome he is call the briton reveller .
when he was here , he did incline to sadness , and not knowing why .
i never saw him sad .
there is a frenchman his companion , one an eminent monsieur , that , it seems , much loves a gallian girl at home , he furnaces the thick sighs from him , whiles the jolly briton your lord , i mean laughs from free lungs , cries ' o , can my sides hold , to think that man , who knows by history , report , or his own proof , what woman is , yea , what she can not choose but must be , will his free hours languish for assured bondage ? '
will my lord say so ?
ay , madam , with his eyes in flood with laughter it is a recreation to be by and hear him mock the frenchman .
but , heavens know , some men are much to blame .
not he , i hope .
not he but yet heaven bounty towards him might be used more thankfully .
in himself , is much , in you , which i account his beyond all talents , whilst i am bound to wonder , i am bound to pity too .
what do you pity , sir ?
two creatures heartily .
am i one , sir ?
you look on me what wreck discern you in me deserves your pity ?
lamentable !
what , to hide me from the radiant sun and solace i ' the dungeon by a snuff ?
i pray you , sir , deliver with more openness your answers to my demands .
why do you pity me ?
that others do i was about to say enjoy your but it is an office of the gods to venge it , not mine to speak on .
you do seem to know something of me , or what concerns me pray you , since doubling things go ill often hurts more than to be sure they do , for certainties either are past remedies , or , timely knowing , the remedy then born discover to me what both you spur and stop .
had i this cheek to bathe my lips upon , this hand , whose touch , whose every touch , would force the feeler soul to the oath of loyalty , this object , which takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye , fixing it only here , should i , damn then , slaver with lips as common as the stairs that mount the capitol , join gripes with hands made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood , as with labour , then in an eye base and unlustrous as the smoky light that fed with stinking tallow , it were fit that all the plagues of hell should at one time encounter such revolt .
my lord , i fear , has forgot britain .
and himself .
not i , inclined to this intelligence , pronounce the beggary of his change , but is your graces that from pay mutest conscience to my tongue charms this report out .
let me hear no more .
o dearest soul !
your cause doth strike my heart with pity , that doth make me sick .
a lady so fair , and fasten to an empery , would make the king double , to be partner with tomboys hired with that which your own coffers yield !
with diseased ventures that play with all infirmities for gold which rottenness can lend nature !
such boil stuff as well might poison poison !
be revenged , or she that bore you was no queen , and you recoil from your great stock .
revenged !
how should i be revenged ?
if this be true , as i have such a heart that both mine ears must not in haste abuse if it be true , how should i be revenged ?
should he make me live , like diana priest , betwixt cold sheets , whiles he is vaulting variable ramps , in your despite , upon your purse ?
revenge it .
i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure , more noble than that runagate to your bed , and will continue fast to your affection , still close as sure .
what , ho , pisanio !
let me my service tender on your lips .
away !
i do condemn mine ears that have so long attended thee .
if thou wert honourable , thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue , not for such an end thou , as base as strange .
thou a gentleman , who is as far from thy report as thou from honour , and here a lady that disdains thee and the devil alike .
what ho , pisanio !
the king my father shall be made acquainted of thy assault if he shall think it fit , a saucy stranger in his court to mart as in a romish stew and to expound his beastly mind to us , he hath a court he little cares for and a daughter who he not respects at all .
what , ho , pisanio !
o happy leonatus !
i may say the credit that thy lady hath of thee deserves thy trust , and thy most perfect goodness her assured credit .
blessed live you long !
a lady to the worthiest sir that ever country call his !
and you his mistress , only for the most worthiest fit !
give me your pardon .
i have spoke this , to know if your affiance were deeply rooted , and shall make your lord , that which he is , new and he is one the truest manner , such a holy witch that he enchants societies into him , half all men hearts are his .
you make amends .
he sits men like a descended god he hath a kind of honour sets him off , more than a mortal seeming .
be not angry , most mighty princess , that i have adventured to try your taking a false report , which hath honour with confirmation your great judgment in the election of a sir so rare , which you know can not err the love i bear him made me to fan you thus , but the gods made you , unlike all others , chaffless .
pray , your pardon .
all well , sir take my power i ' the court for yours .
my humble thanks .
i had almost forgot to entreat your grace but in a small request , and yet of moment to , for it concerns your lord , myself and other noble friends , are partners in the business .
pray , what ?
some dozen romans of us and your lord the best feather of our wing have mingled sums to buy a present for the emperor which i , the factor for the rest , have done in france is plate of rare device , and jewels of rich and exquisite form , their values great , and i am something curious , being strange , to have them in safe stowage may it please you to take them in protection ?
willingly , and pawn mine honour for their safety since my lord hath interest in them , i will keep them in my bedchamber .
they are in a trunk , attended by my men i will make bold to send them to you , only for this night , i must aboard .
o , no , no .
yes , i beseech , or i shall short my word by lengthening my return .
from gallia i cross the seas on purpose and on promise to see your grace .
i thank you for your pains but not away !
o , i must , madam therefore i shall beseech you , if you please to greet your lord with writing , i have outstood my time , which is material to the tender of our present .

you sin against obedience , which you owe your father .
for the contract you pretend with that base wretch , one bred of alms and foster with cold dishes , with scraps o ' the court , it is no contract , none and though it be allow in meaner parties yet who than he more mean ? to knit their souls , on whom there is no more dependency but brats and beggary , in knot , yet you are curb from that enlargement by the consequence o ' the crown , and must not soil the precious note of it with a base slave .

profane fellow wert thou the son of jupiter and no more but what thou art besides , thou wert too base to be his groom thou wert dignified enough , even to the point of envy , if made comparative for your virtues , to be styled the of his kingdom , and hated for being preferred so well .

what means do you make to him ?
not any , but abide the change of time , quake in the present winter state and wish that warmer days would come in these sear hopes , i barely gratify your love , they failing , i must die much your debtor .
your very goodness and your company all i can do .
by this , your king hath heard of great augustus caius lucius will do commission throughly and i think he grant the tribute , send the arrearages , or look upon our romans , whose remembrance is yet fresh in their grief .
i do believe , statist though i am none , nor like to be , that this will prove a war , and you shall hear the legions now in gallia sooner landed in our britain than have tidings of any penny tribute paid .
our countrymen are men more order than when julius caesar smiled at their lack of skill , but found their courage worthy his frowning at their discipline , now mingled with their courages , will make known to their approvers they are people such that mend upon the world .
enter iachimo see !
iachimo !
the swiftest harts have posted you by land , and winds of all the comers kiss your sails , to make your vessel nimble .
welcome , sir .
i hope the briefness of your answer made the speediness of your return .
your lady is one of the fairest that i have look upon .
and therewithal the best , or let her beauty look through a casement to allure false hearts and be false with them .
here are letters for you .
their tenor good , i trust .
is very like .
was caius lucius in the britain court when you were there ?
he was expected then , but not approach .
all is well yet .
sparkles this stone as it was wont ?
or not too dull for your good wearing ?
if i had lost it , i should have lost the worth of it in gold .
i make a journey twice as far , to enjoy a second night of such sweet shortness which was mine in britain , for the ring is won .
the stone too hard to come by .
not a whit , your lady being so easy .
make not , sir , your loss your sport i hope you know that we must not continue friends .
good sir , we must , if you keep covenant .
had i not brought the knowledge of your mistress home , i grant we were to question further but i now profess myself the winner of her honour , together with your ring , and not the wronger of her or you , having proceeded but by both your wills .
if you can apparent that you have tasted her in bed , my hand and ring is yours , if not , the foul opinion you had of her pure honour gains or loses your sword or mine , or masterless leaves both to who shall find them .
sir , my circumstances , being so near the truth as i will make them , must first induce you to believe whose strength i will confirm with oath , which , i doubt not , you give me leave to spare , when you shall find you need it not .
proceed .
first , her bedchamber , where , i confess , i slept not , but profess had that was well worth watching it was hang with tapesty of silk and silver , the story proud cleopatra , when she met her roman , and cydnus swell above the banks , or for the press of boats or pride a piece of work so bravely done , so rich , that it did strive in workmanship and value , which i wonder could be so rarely and exactly wrought , since the true life o was this is true , and this you might have heard of here , by me , or by some other .
more particulars must justify my knowledge .
so they must , or do your honour injury .
the chimney is south the chamber , and the chaste dian bathing never saw i figures so likely to report themselves the cutter was as another nature , dumb , outwent her , motion and breath left out .
this is a thing which you might from relation likewise reap , being , as it is , much spoke of .
the roof o ' the chamber with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons i had forgot them were two winking cupids of silver , each on one foot standing , nicely depending on their brands .
this is her honour !
let it be granted you have seen all this and praise be given to your remembrance the description of what is in her chamber nothing saves the wager you have laid .
then , if you can , showing the bracelet be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel , see !
and now is up again it must be married to that your diamond , i keep them .
jove !
once more let me behold it is it that which i left with her ?
sir i thank her that she stripp it from her arm , i see her yet , her pretty action did outsell her gift , and yet enrich it too she gave it me , and said she prized it once .
may be she pluck it off to send it me .
she writes so to you , doth she ?
o , no , no , no !
is true .
here , take this too , gives the ring it is a basilisk unto mine eye , kills me to look o .
let there be no honour where there is beauty , truth , where semblance , love , where there another man the vows of women of no more bondage be , to where they are made , than they are to their virtues , which is nothing .
o , above measure false !
have patience , sir , and take your ring again , is not yet won it may be probable she lost it , or who knows if one of her women , being corrupted , hath it from her ?
very true , and so , i hope , he came .
back my ring render to me some corporal sign about her , more evident than this , for this was stolen .
by jupiter , i had it from her arm .
hark you , he swears , by jupiter he swears .
is true nay , keep the ring is true i am sure she would not lose it her attendants are all sworn and honourable they induced to steal it !
and by a stranger ! no , he hath enjoyed her the cognizance of her incontinency is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly .
there , take thy hire , and all the fiends of hell divide themselves between you !
sir , be patient this is not strong enough to be believed of one persuaded well of never talk o , she hath been colted by him .
if you seek for further satisfying , under her breast worthy the pressing lies a mole , right proud of that most delicate lodging by my life , i kiss it , and it gave me present hunger to feed again , though full .
you do remember this stain upon her ?
ay , and it doth confirm another stain , as big as hell can hold , were there no more but it .
will you hear more ?
spare your arithmetic never count the turns , once , and a million !
i be sworn no swearing .
if you will swear you have not , you lie , and i will kill thee , if thou dost deny made me cuckold .
i deny nothing .
o , that i had her here , to tear her !
i will go there and , i ' the court , before her father .
i do something exit quite besides the government of patience !
you have won let follow him , and pervert the present wrath he hath against himself .
with an my heart .

and mounted , found no opposition but what he look for should oppose and she should from encounter guard .
could i find out the woman part in me !
for there no motion that tends to vice in man , but i affirm it is the woman part be it lying , note it , the woman , flattering , hers , deceiving , hers , lust and rank thoughts , hers , hers , revenges , hers , ambitions , covetings , change of prides , disdain , nice longing , slanders , mutability , all faults that may be named , nay , that hell knows , why , hers , in part or all , but rather , all , for even to vice they are not constant but are changing still one vice , but of a minute old , for one not half so old as that .
i write against them , detest them , curse them yet is greater skill in a true hate , to pray they have their will the very devils can not plague them better .
exit act iii scene britain .
a hall in cymbeline palace .
enter in state , cymbeline , queen , cloten , and lords at one door , and at another , caius lucius and attendants now say , what would augustus caesar with us ?
when julius caesar , whose remembrance yet lives in men eyes and will to ears and tongues be theme and hearing ever , was in this britain and conquer it , cassibelan , thine uncle , famous in caesar praises , no whit less than in his feats deserving it for him and his succession granted rome a tribute , yearly three thousand pounds , which by thee lately is left untender .
and , to kill the marvel , shall be so ever .
there be many caesars , ere such another julius .
britain is a world by itself , and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses .
that opportunity which then they had to take from , to resume we have again .
remember , sir , my liege , the kings your ancestors , together with the natural bravery of your isle , which stands as neptune park , ribbed and paled in with rocks unscalable and roaring waters , with sands that will not bear your enemies ' boats , but suck them up to the topmast .
a kind of conquest caesar made here , but made not here his brag of ' and ' and ' with shame that first that ever touch him he was carried from off our coast , twice beaten , and his shipping poor ignorant baubles ! upon our terrible seas , like moved upon their surges , crack as easily our rocks for joy whereof the famed cassibelan , who was once at point o giglot fortune ! to master caesar sword , made lud town with rejoicing fires bright and britons strut with courage .
come , there no more tribute to be paid our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time , and , as i said , there is no moe such caesars other of them may have crook noses , but to owe such straight arms , none .
son , let your mother end .
we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as cassibelan i do not say i am one , but i have a hand .
why tribute ?
why should we pay tribute ?
if caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket , or put the moon in his pocket , we will pay him tribute for light , else , sir , no more tribute , pray you now .
you must know , till the injurious romans did extort this tribute from us , we were free caesar ambition , which swell so much that it did almost stretch the sides o ' the world , against all colour here did put the yoke upon , which to shake off becomes a warlike people , whom we reckon ourselves to be .
we do .
say , then , to caesar , our ancestor was that mulmutius which ordain our laws , whose use the sword of caesar hath too much mangled , whose repair and franchise shall , by the power we hold , be our good deed , though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws , who was the first of britain which did put his brows within a golden crown and call himself a king .
i am sorry , cymbeline , that i am to pronounce augustus caesar caesar , that hath more kings his servants than thyself domestic officers thine enemy receive it from me , then war and confusion in caesar name pronounce i thee look for fury not to be resisted .
thus defied , i thank thee for myself .
thou art welcome , caius .
thy caesar knighted me , my youth i spent much under him , of him i gather honour , which he to seek of me again , perforce , behoves me keep at utterance .
i am perfect that the pannonians and dalmatians for their liberties are now in arms , a precedent which not to read would show the britons cold so caesar shall not find them .
let proof speak .
his majesty bids you welcome .
make pastime with us a day or two , or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms , you shall find us in our girdle if you beat us out of it , it is yours , if you fall in the adventure , our crows shall fare the better for you , and there an end .
so , sir .
i know your master pleasure and he mine all the remain is ! '
exeunt scene ii .
another room in the palace .
enter pisanio , with a letter how ?
of adultery ?
wherefore write you not what monster her accuser ?
leonatus , o master !
what a strange infection is into thy ear !
what false italian , as as handed , hath prevail on thy too ready hearing ?
disloyal !
no she punish for her truth , and undergoes , more than , such assaults as would take in some virtue .
o my master !
thy mind to her is now as low as were thy fortunes .
how !
that i should murder her ?
upon the love and truth and vows which i have made to thy command ?
i , her ?
her blood ?
if it be so to do good service , never let me be counted serviceable .
how look i , that i should seem to lack humanity so much as this fact comes to ?
reading the letter that i have sent her , by her own command shall give thee opportunity . '
o damn paper !
black as the ink that on thee !
senseless bauble , art thou a feodary for this act , and so without ?
lo , here she comes .
i am ignorant in what i am commanded .
enter imogen how now , pisanio !
madam , here is a letter from my lord .
who ?
thy lord ?
that is my lord , leonatus !
o , learn indeed were that astronomer that knew the stars as i his characters , lay the future open .
you good gods , let what is here contain relish of love , of my lord health , of his content , yet not that we two are asunder , let that grieve him some griefs are , that is one of them , for it doth physic love of his content , all but in that !
good wax , thy leave .
blest be you bees that make these locks of counsel !
lovers and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike though forfeiters you cast in prison , yet you clasp young cupid tables .
good news , gods !
reads , and your father wrath , should he take me in his dominion , could not be so cruel to me , as you , o the dearest of creatures , would even renew me with your eyes .
take notice that i am in cambria , at what your own love will out of this advise you , follow .
so he wishes you all happiness , that remains loyal to his vow , and your , increasing in love , leonatus posthumus . '
o , for a horse with wings !
thou , pisanio ?
he is at read , and tell me how far is thither .
if one of mean affairs may plod it in a week , why may not i glide thither in a day ?
then , true pisanio , who , like me , to see thy lord , who , let me bate , not like me yet , but in a fainter kind o , not like me , for mine beyond beyond say , and speak thick , love counsellor should fill the bores of hearing , to the smothering of the sense how far it is to this same blessed milford and by the way tell me how wales was made so happy as to inherit such a haven but first of all , how we may steal from hence , and for the gap that we shall make in time , from our and our return , to excuse but first , how get hence why should excuse be born or begot ?
we talk of that hereafter .
prithee , speak , how many score of miles may we well ride hour and hour ?
one score sun and sun , madam , enough for you aside and too much too .
why , one that rode to execution , man , could never go so slow i have heard of riding wagers , where horses have been nimbler than the sands that run i ' the clock behalf .
but this is foolery go bid my woman feign a sickness , say she home to her father and provide me presently a , no costlier than would fit a franklin housewife .
madam , you best consider .
i see before me , man nor here , nor here , nor what ensues , but have a fog in them , that i can not look through .
away , i prithee , do as i bid thee there no more to say , accessible is none but milford way .
exeunt scene iii .
wales a mountainous country with a cave .
enter , from the cave , belarius , guiderius , and arviragus following a goodly day not to keep house , with such whose roof as low as ours !
stoop , boys , this gate instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you to a morning holy office the gates of monarchs are arch so high that giants may jet through and keep their impious turbans on , without good morrow to the sun .
hail , thou fair heaven !
we house i ' the rock , yet use thee not so hardly as prouder livers do .
hail , heaven !
hail , heaven !
now for our mountain sport up to yond hill , your legs are young , i tread these flats .
consider , when you above perceive me like a crow , that it is place which lessens and sets off , and you may then revolve what tales i have told you of courts , of princes , of the tricks in war this service is not service , so being done , but being so allow to apprehend thus , draws us a profit from all things we see , and often , to our comfort , shall we find the sharded beetle in a safer hold than is the eagle .
o , this life is nobler than attending for a cheque , richer than doing nothing for a bauble , prouder than rustling in silk such gain the cap of him that makes fine , yet keeps his book uncross no life to ours .
out of your proof you speak we , poor unfledged , have never wing from view o ' the nest , nor know not what air from home .
haply this life is best , if quiet life be best , sweeter to you that have a sharper known , well corresponding with your stiff age but unto us it is a cell of ignorance , travelling , a prison for a debtor , that not dares to stride a limit .
what should we speak of when we are old as you ?
when we shall hear the rain and wind beat dark december , how , in this our pinching cave , shall we discourse the freezing hours away ?
we have seen nothing , we are beastly , subtle as the fox for prey , like warlike as the wolf for what we eat , our valour is to chase what flies , our cage we make a quire , as doth the prison bird , and sing our bondage freely .
how you speak !
did you but know the city usuries and felt them knowingly , the art o ' the court as hard to leave as keep , whose top to climb is certain falling , or so slippery that the fear as bad as falling , the toil o ' the war , a pain that only seems to seek out danger i ' the name of fame and honour , which dies i ' the search , and hath as oft a slanderous epitaph as record of fair act , nay , many times , doth ill deserve by doing well , what worse , must at the censure o boys , this story the world may read in me my body mark with roman swords , and my report was once first with the best of note cymbeline loved me , and when a soldier was the theme , my name was not far off then was i as a tree whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night , a storm or robbery , call it what you will , shook down my mellow hangings , nay , my leaves , and left me bare to weather .
uncertain favour !
my fault being nothing as i have told you oft but that two villains , whose false oaths prevail before my perfect honour , swore to cymbeline i was confederate with the romans so follow my banishment , and this twenty years this rock and these demesnes have been my world , where i have lived at honest freedom , paid more pious debts to heaven than in all the of my time .
but up to the mountains !
this is not hunters ' language he that strikes the venison first shall be the lord o ' the feast , to him the other two shall minister , and we will fear no poison , which attends in place of greater state .
i meet you in the valleys .
exeunt guiderius and arviragus how hard it is to hide the sparks of nature !
these boys know little they are sons to the king , nor cymbeline dreams that they are alive .
they think they are mine , and though train up thus meanly i ' the cave wherein they bow , their thoughts do hit the roofs of palaces , and nature prompts them in simple and low things to prince it much beyond the trick of others .
this polydore , the heir of cymbeline and britain , who the king his father call guiderius , jove !
when on my stool i sit and tell the warlike feats i have done , his spirits fly out into my story say , mine enemy fell , and thus i set my foot on neck , ' even then the princely blood flows in his cheek , he sweats , strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture that acts my words .
the younger brother , cadwal , once arviragus , in as like a figure , strikes life into my speech and shows much more his own hark , the game is roused !
o cymbeline !
heaven and my conscience knows thou didst unjustly banish me whereon , at three and two years old , i stole these babes , thinking to bar thee of succession , as thou me of my lands .
euriphile , thou wast their nurse , they took thee for their mother , and every day do honour to her grave myself , belarius , that am morgan call , they take for natural father .
the game is up .
exit scene iv .
country near .
enter pisanio and imogen thou me , when we came from horse , the place was near at hand long my mother so to see me first , as i have now .
pisanio !
man !
where is posthumus ?
what is in thy mind , that makes thee stare thus ?
wherefore breaks that sigh from the inward of thee ?
one , but painted thus , would be interpreted a thing perplex beyond put thyself into a havior of less fear , ere wildness vanquish my staider senses .
what the matter ?
why thou that paper to me , with a look untender ?
be summer news , smile before , if winterly , thou but keep that countenance still .
my husband hand !
that italy hath him , and he at some hard point .
speak , man thy tongue may take off some extremity , which to read would be even mortal to me .
please you , read , and you shall find me , wretched man , a thing the most disdain of fortune .
reads mistress , pisanio , hath played the strumpet in my bed , the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me .
i speak not out of weak surmises , but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as i expect my revenge .
that part thou , pisanio , must act for me , if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers .
let thine own hands take away her life i shall give thee opportunity at .
she hath my letter for the purpose where , if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done , thou art the pandar to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal . '
what shall i need to draw my sword ?
the paper hath cut her throat already .
no , is slander , whose edge is sharper than the sword , whose tongue outvenoms all the worms of nile , whose breath rides on the posting winds and doth belie all corners of the world kings , queens and states , maids , matrons , nay , the secrets of the grave this viperous slander enters .
what cheer , madam ?
false to his bed !
what is it to be false ?
to lie in watch there and to think on him ?
to weep clock and clock ?
if sleep charge nature , to break it with a fearful dream of him and cry myself awake ?
that false to bed , is it ?
alas , good lady !
i false !
thy conscience witness iachimo , thou didst accuse him of incontinency , thou then like a villain , now methinks thy favour good enough .
some jay of italy whose mother was her painting , hath betray him poor i am stale , a garment out of fashion , and , for i am richer than to hang by the walls , i must be ripp to pieces with me ! o , men vows are women traitors !
all good seeming , by thy revolt , o husband , shall be thought put on for villany , not born grows , but worn a bait for ladies .
good madam , hear me .
true honest men being heard , like false aeneas , were in his time thought false , and sinon weeping did scandal many a holy tear , took pity from most true wretchedness so thou , posthumus , wilt lay the leaven on all proper men , goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured from thy great fall .
come , fellow , be thou honest do thou thy master bidding when thou him , a little witness my obedience look !
i draw the sword myself take it , and hit the innocent mansion of my love , my heart , fear not , is empty of all things but grief , thy master is not there , who was indeed the riches of it do his bidding , strike thou mayst be valiant in a better cause , but now thou a coward .
hence , vile instrument !
thou shalt not damn my hand .
why , i must die , and if i do not by thy hand , thou art no servant of thy master .
against there is a prohibition so divine that cravens my weak hand .
come , here my heart .
something .
soft , soft !
we no defence , obedient as the scabbard .
what is here ?
the scriptures of the loyal leonatus , all turn to heresy ?
away , away , corrupters of my faith !
you shall no more be stomachers to my heart .
thus may poor fools believe false teachers though those that are betray do feel the treason sharply , yet the traitor stands in worse case of woe .
and thou , posthumus , thou that didst set up my disobedience the king my father and make me put into contempt the suits of princely fellows , shalt hereafter find it is no act of common passage , but a strain of rareness and i grieve myself to think , when thou shalt be disedged by her that now thou tirest on , how thy memory will then be pang by me .
prithee , dispatch the lamb entreats the butcher where thy knife ?
thou art too slow to do thy master bidding , when i desire it too .
o gracious lady , since i received command to do this business i have not slept one wink .
, and to bed then .
i wake mine blind first .
wherefore then didst undertake it ?
why hast thou abused so many miles with a pretence ?
this place ?
mine action and thine own ?
our horses ' labour ?
the time inviting thee ?
the perturb court , for my being absent ?
whereunto i never purpose return .
why hast thou gone so far , to be unbent when thou hast thy stand , the elected deer before thee ?
but to win time to lose so bad employment , in the which i have consider of a course .
good lady , hear me with patience .
talk thy tongue weary , speak i have heard i am a strumpet , and mine ear therein false struck , can take no greater wound , nor tent to bottom that .
but speak .
then , madam , i thought you would not back again .
most like , bringing me here to kill me .
not so , neither but if i were as wise as honest , then my purpose would prove well .
it can not be but that my master is abused some villain , ay , and singular in his art .
hath done you both this cursed injury .
some roman courtezan .
no , on my life .
i give but notice you are dead and send him some bloody sign of it , for is commanded i should do so you shall be miss at court , and that will well confirm it .
why good fellow , what shall i do the where ?
where bide ?
how live ?
or in my life what comfort , when i am dead to my husband ?
if you back to the court no court , no father , nor no more ado with that harsh , noble , simple nothing , that cloten , whose hath been to me as fearful as a siege .
if not at court , then not in britain must you bide .
where then hath britain all the sun that shines ?
day , night , are they not but in britain ?
i ' the world volume our britain seems as of it , but not in , in a great pool a swan nest prithee , think there livers out of britain .
i am most glad you think of other place .
the ambassador , lucius the roman , comes to now , if you could wear a mind dark as your fortune is , and but disguise that which , to appear itself , must not yet be but by , you should tread a course pretty and full of view , yea , haply , near the residence of posthumus , so nigh at least that though his actions were not visible , yet report should render him hourly to your ear as truly as he moves .
o , for such means !
though peril to my modesty , not death o , i would adventure .
well , then , here the point you must forget to be a woman , change command into obedience fear and niceness the handmaids of all women , or , more truly , woman its pretty self into a waggish courage ready in gibes , , saucy and as quarrelous as the weasel , nay , you must forget that rarest treasure of your cheek , exposing it but , o , the harder heart !
alack , no remedy ! to the greedy touch of titan , and forget your laboursome and dainty trims , wherein you made great juno angry .
nay , be brief i see into thy end , and am almost a man already .
first , make yourself but like one .
this , i have already fit is in my doublet , hat , hose , all that answer to them would you in their serving , and with what imitation you can borrow from youth of such a season , noble lucius present yourself , desire his service , tell him wherein you happy , which you make him know , if that his head have ear in music , doubtless with joy he will embrace you , for he honourable and doubling that , most holy .
your means abroad , you have me , rich , and i will never fail beginning nor supplyment .
thou art all the comfort the gods will diet me with .
prithee , away there more to be consider , but we even all that good time will give us this attempt i am soldier to , and will abide it with a prince courage .
away , i prithee .
well , madam , we must take a short farewell , lest , being miss , i be suspected of your carriage from the court .
my noble mistress , here is a box , i had it from the queen what i is precious , if you are sick at sea , or at land , a dram of this will drive away distemper .
to some shade , and fit you to your manhood .
may the gods direct you to the best !
amen i thank thee .
exeunt , severally scene a room in cymbeline palace .
enter cymbeline , queen , cloten , lucius , lords , and attendants thus far , and so farewell .
thanks , royal sir .
my emperor hath wrote , i must from hence , and am right sorry that i must report ye my master enemy .
our subjects , sir , will not endure his yoke , and for ourself to show less sovereignty than they , must needs appear unkinglike .
so , sir i desire of you a conduct to .
madam , all joy befal your grace !
and you !
my lords , you are appointed for that office , the due of honour in no point omit .
so farewell , noble lucius .
your hand , my lord .
receive it friendly , but from this time forth i wear it as your enemy .
sir , the event is yet to name the winner fare you well .
leave not the worthy lucius , good my lords , till he have cross the severn .
happiness !
exeunt lucius and lords he goes hence frowning but it honours us that we have given him cause .
is all the better , your valiant britons have their wishes in it .
lucius hath wrote already to the emperor how it goes here .
it fits us therefore ripely our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness the powers that he already hath in gallia will soon be drawn to head , from whence he moves his war for britain .
is not sleepy business , but must be look to speedily and strongly .
our expectation that it would be thus hath made us forward .
but , my gentle queen , where is our daughter ?
she hath not appear before the roman , nor to us hath tender the duty of the day she looks us like a thing more made of malice than of duty we have noted it .
call her before us , for we have been too slight in sufferance .
exit an attendant royal sir , since the exile of posthumus , most retired hath her life been , the cure whereof , my lord , is time must do .
beseech your majesty , forbear sharp speeches to her she a lady so tender of rebukes that words are strokes and strokes death to her .
attendant where is she , sir ?
how can her contempt be answer ?
please you , sir , her chambers are all lock , and there no answer that will be given to the loudest noise we make .
my lord , when last i went to visit her , she pray me to excuse her keeping close , whereto constrain by her infirmity , she should that duty leave unpaid to you , which daily she was bound to proffer this she wish me to make known , but our great court made me to blame in memory .
her doors lock ?
not seen of late ?
grant , heavens , that which i fear prove false !
exit son , i say , follow the king .
that man of hers , pisanio , her old servant , have not seen these two days .
go , look after .
exit cloten pisanio , thou that so for posthumus !
he hath a drug of mine , i pray his absence proceed by swallowing that , for he believes it is a thing most precious .
but for her , where is she gone ?
haply , despair hath seized her , or , wing with fervor of her love , she flown to her desired posthumus gone she is to death or to dishonour , and my end can make good use of either she being down , i have the placing of the british crown .
cloten how now , my son !
is certain she is fled .
go in and cheer the king he rages , none dare come about him .
aside all the better may this night forestall him of the coming day !
exit i love and hate her for she fair and royal , and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite than lady , ladies , woman , from every one the best she hath , and she , of all compounded , outsells them all , i love her therefore but disdaining me and throwing favours on the low posthumus slanders so her judgment that what else rare is choked , and in that point i will conclude to hate her , nay , indeed , to be revenged upon her .
for when fools shall enter pisanio who is here ?
what , are you packing , sirrah ?
come hither ah , you precious pander !
villain , where is thy lady ?
in a word , or else thou art straightway with the fiends .
o , good my lord !
where is thy lady ?
or , by jupiter , i will not ask again .
close villain , i have this secret from thy heart , or rip thy heart to find it .
is she with posthumus ?
from whose so many weights of baseness can not a dram of worth be drawn .
alas , my lord , how can she be with him ?
when was she missed ?
he is in rome .
where is she , sir ?
come nearer , no further halting satisfy me home what is become of her .
o , my lord !
villain !
discover where thy mistress is at once , at the next word no more of lord ! '
speak , or thy silence on the instant is thy condemnation and thy death .
then , sir , this paper is the history of my knowledge touching her flight .
presenting a letter let .
i will pursue her even to augustus ' throne .
aside or this , or perish .
she far enough , and what he learns by this may prove his travel , not her danger .
hum !
aside i write to my lord she dead .
o imogen , safe mayst thou wander , safe return again !
sirrah , is this letter true ?
sir , as i think .
it is posthumus ' hand , i .
sirrah , if thou wouldst not be a villain , but do me true service , undergo those employments wherein i should have cause to use thee with a serious industry , that is , what villany i bid thee do , to perform it directly and truly , i would think thee an honest man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment .
well , my good lord .
wilt thou serve me ?
for since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar posthumus , thou canst not , in the course of gratitude , but be a diligent follower of mine wilt thou serve me ?
sir , i will .
give me thy hand , here my purse .
hast any of thy late master garments in thy possession ?
i have , my lord , at my lodging , the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress .
the first service thou dost me , fetch that suit hither let it be thy lint service , go .
i shall , my lord .
exit meet thee at ! i forgot to ask him one thing , i anon even there , thou villain posthumus , will i kill thee .
i would these garments were come .
she said upon a time the bitterness of it i now belch from my heart that she held the very garment of posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities .
with that suit upon my back , will i ravish her first kill him , and in her eyes , there shall she see my valour , which will then be a torment to her contempt .
he on the ground , my speech of insultment ended on his dead body , and when my lust hath dined , which , as i say , to vex her i will execute in the clothes that she so praised , to the court i knock her back , foot her home again .
she hath despised me rejoicingly , and i be merry in my revenge .
pisanio , with the clothes be those the garments ?
ay , my noble lord .
how long since she went to ?
she can scarce be there yet .
bring this apparel to my chamber , that is the second thing that i have commanded thee the third is , that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design .
be but duteous , and true preferment shall tender itself to thee .
my revenge is now at milford would i had wings to follow it !
come , and be true .
exit thou me to my loss for true to thee were to prove false , which i will never be , to him that is most true .
to milford go , and find not her whom thou pursuest .
flow , flow , you heavenly blessings , on her !
this fool speed be cross with slowness , labour be his meed !

i think foundations fly the wretched , such , i mean , where they should be relieved .
two beggars told me i could not miss my way will poor folks lie , that have afflictions on them , knowing is a punishment or trial ?
yes , no wonder , when rich ones scarce tell true .
to lapse in fulness is sorer than to lie for need , and falsehood is worse in kings than beggars .
my dear lord !
thou art one o ' the false ones .
now i think on thee , my hunger gone , but even before , i was at point to sink for food .

imogen good masters , harm me not before i enter here , i call , and thought to have begg or bought what i have took good troth , i have nought , nor would not , though i had found gold strew i ' the floor .

boys , we go dress our hunt .
fair youth , come in discourse is heavy , fasting , when we have supp , we mannerly demand thee of thy story , so far as thou wilt speak it .

why should his mistress , who was made by him that made the tailor , not be fit too ?
the rather saving reverence of the word for is said a woman fitness comes by fits .
therein i must play the workman .
i dare speak it to myself for it is not for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber i mean , the lines of my body are as well drawn as his , no less young , more strong , not beneath him in fortunes , beyond him in the advantage of the time , above him in birth , alike conversant in general services , and more remarkable in single oppositions yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite .
what mortality is !
posthumus , thy head , which now is growing upon thy shoulders , shall within this hour be off , thy mistress enforced , thy garments cut to pieces before thy face and all this done , spurn her home to her father , who may haply be a little angry for my so rough usage , but my mother , having power of his testiness , shall turn all into my commendations .
my horse is tied up safe out , sword , and to a sore purpose !
fortune , put them into my hand !
this is the very description of their , and the fellow dares not deceive me .
exit scene ii .
before the cave of belarius .
enter , from the cave , belarius , guiderius , arviragus , and imogen to imogen you are not well remain here in the cave , we come to you after hunting .
to imogen brother , stay here are we not brothers ?
so man and man should be , but clay and clay differs in dignity , whose dust is both alike .
i am very sick .
go you to hunting , i abide with him .
so sick i am not , yet i am not well , but not so citizen a wanton as to seem to die ere sick so please you , leave me , stick to your journal course the breach of custom is breach of all .
i am ill , but your being by me can not amend me , society is no comfort to one not sociable i am not very sick , since i can reason of it .
pray you , trust me here i rob none but myself , and let me die , stealing so poorly .
i love thee , i have spoke it how much the quantity , the weight as much , as i do love my father .
what !
how !
how !
if it be sin to say so , i yoke me in my good brother fault i know not why i love this youth , and i have heard you say , love reason without reason the bier at door , and a demand who shall die , i say father , not this youth . '
aside o noble strain !
o worthiness of nature !
breed of greatness !
cowards father cowards and base things sire base nature hath meal and bran , contempt and grace .
i not their father , yet who this should be , doth miracle itself , loved before me .
is the ninth hour o ' the morn .
brother , farewell .
i wish ye sport .
you health .
so please you , sir .
aside these are kind creatures .
gods , what lies i have heard !
our courtiers say all savage but at court experience , o , thou disprovest report !
the imperious seas breed monsters , for the dish poor tributary rivers as sweet fish .
i am sick still , .
pisanio , i now taste of thy drug .
swallows some i could not stir him he said he was gentle , but unfortunate , dishonestly afflicted , but yet honest .
thus did he answer me yet said , hereafter i might know more .
to the field , to the field !
we leave you for this time go in and rest .
we not be long away .
pray , be not sick , for you must be our housewife .
well or ill , i am bound to you .
and shalt be ever .
exit imogen , to the cave this youth , distress , appears he hath had good ancestors .
how he sings !
but his neat cookery !
he cut our roots in characters , and sauced our broths , as juno had been sick and he her dieter .
nobly he yokes a smiling with a sigh , as if the sigh was that it was , for not being such a smile , the smile mocking the sigh , that it would fly from so divine a temple , to commix with winds that sailors rail at .
i do note that grief and patience , rooted in him both , mingle their spurs together .
grow , patience !
and let the stinking elder , grief , untwine his perishing root with the increasing vine !
it is great morning .
come , away ! who there ?
enter cloten i can not find those runagates , that villain hath mock me .
i am faint .
runagates ! '
means he not us ?
i partly know him is cloten , the son o ' the queen .
i fear some ambush .
i saw him not these many years , and yet i know is he .
we are held as outlaws hence !
he is but one you and my brother search what companies are near pray you , away , let me alone with him .
exeunt belarius and arviragus soft !
what are you that fly me thus ?
some villain mountaineers ?
i have heard of such .
what slave art thou ?
a thing more slavish did i than answering a slave without a knock .
thou art a robber , a , a villain yield thee , thief .
to who ?
to thee ?
what art thou ?
have not i an arm as big as thine ?
a heart as big ?
thy words , i grant , are bigger , for i wear not my dagger in my mouth .
say what thou art , why i should yield to thee ?
thou villain base , me not by my clothes ?
no , nor thy tailor , rascal , who is thy grandfather he made those clothes , which , as it seems , make thee .
thou precious varlet , my tailor made them not .
hence , then , and thank the man that gave them thee .
thou art some fool , i am loath to beat thee .
thou injurious thief , hear but my name , and tremble .
what thy name ?
cloten , thou villain .
cloten , thou double villain , be thy name , i can not tremble at it were it toad , or adder , spider , move me sooner .
to thy further fear , nay , to thy mere confusion , thou shalt know i am son to the queen .
i am sorry for , not seeming so worthy as thy birth .
art not afeard ?
those that i reverence those i fear , the wise at fools i laugh , not fear them .
die the death when i have slain thee with my proper hand , i follow those that even now fled hence , and on the gates of set your heads yield , rustic mountaineer .
exeunt , fighting belarius and arviragus no companies abroad ?
none in the world you did mistake him , sure .
i can not tell long is it since i saw him , but time hath nothing blurr those lines of favour which then he wore , the snatches in his voice , and burst of speaking , were as his i am absolute was very cloten .
in this place we left them i wish my brother make good time with him , you say he is so fell .
being scarce made up , i mean , to man , he had not apprehension of roaring terrors , for the effect of judgment is oft the cause of fear .
but , see , thy brother .
guiderius , with cloten head this cloten was a fool , an empty purse , there was no money i not hercules could have knock out his brains , for he had none yet i not doing this , the fool had borne my head as i do his .
what hast thou done ?
i am perfect what cut off one cloten head , son to the queen , after his own report , who call me traitor , mountaineer , and swore with his own single hand take us in displace our heads where thank the gods ! they grow , and set them on .
we are all undone .
why , worthy father , what have we to lose , but that he swore to take , our lives ?
the law protects not us then why should we be tender to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us , play judge and executioner all himself , for we do fear the law ?
what company discover you abroad ?
no single soul can we set eye on , but in all safe reason he must have some attendants .
though his humour was nothing but mutation , ay , and that from one bad thing to worse , not frenzy , not absolute madness could so far have raved to bring him here alone , although perhaps it may be heard at court that such as we cave here , hunt here , are outlaws , and in time may make some stronger head , the which he hearing as it is like him might break out , and swear fetch us in , yet not probable to come alone , either he so undertaking , or they so suffering then on good ground we fear , if we do fear this body hath a tail more perilous than the head .
let ordinance come as the gods foresay it , my brother hath done well .
i had no mind to hunt this day the boy fidele sickness did make my way long forth .
with his own sword , which he did wave against my throat , i have his head from him i into the creek behind our rock , and let it to the sea , and tell the fishes he the queen son , cloten that all i reck .
exit i fear be revenged would , polydote , thou hadst not !
though valour becomes thee well enough .
would i had so the revenge alone pursued me !
polydore , i love thee brotherly , but envy much thou hast robb me of this deed i would revenges , that possible strength might meet , would seek us through and put us to our answer .
well , is done we hunt no more , nor seek for danger where there no profit .
i prithee , to our rock , you and fidele play the cooks i stay till hasty polydote return , and bring him to dinner presently .
poor sick fidele !
i weringly to him to gain his colour let a parish of such clotens ' blood , and praise myself for charity .
exit o thou goddess , thou divine nature , how thyself thou in these two princely boys !
they are as gentle as zephyrs blowing below the violet , not wagging his sweet head , and yet as rough , their royal blood enchafed , as the rudest wind , that by the top doth take the mountain pine , and make him stoop to the vale .
is wonder that an invisible instinct should frame them to royalty unlearn , honour untaught , civility not seen from other , valour that wildly grows in them , but yields a crop as if it had been sow .
yet still it strange what cloten being here to us portends , or what his death will bring us .
guiderius where my brother ?
i have sent cloten clotpoll down the stream , in embassy to his mother his body hostage for his return .
solemn music my ingenious instrument !
hark , polydore , it sounds !
but what occasion hath cadwal now to give it motion ?
hark !
is he at home ?
he went hence even now .
what does he mean ?
since death of my mother it did not speak before .
all solemn things should answer solemn accidents .
the matter ?
triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys is jollity for apes and grief for boys .
is cadwal mad ?
look , here he comes , and brings the dire occasion in his arms of what we blame him for .
arviragus , with imogen , as dead , bearing her in his arms the bird is dead that we have made so much on .
i had rather have skipp from sixteen years of age to sixty , to have turn my into a crutch , than have seen this .
o sweetest , fairest lily !
my brother wears thee not the one half so well as when thou thyself .
o melancholy !
who ever yet could sound thy bottom ?
find the ooze , to show what coast thy sluggish crare might easiliest harbour in ?
thou blessed thing !
jove knows what man thou mightst have made , but i , thou diedst , a most rare boy , of melancholy .
how found you him ?
stark , as you see thus smiling , as some fly hid tickled slumber , not as death dart , being laugh at , his right cheek reposing on a cushion .
where ?
o ' the floor , his arms thus leagued i thought he slept , and put my clouted brogues from off my feet , whose rudeness answer my steps too loud .
why , he but sleeps if he be gone , he make his grave a bed , with female fairies will his tomb be haunted , and worms will not come to thee .
with fairest flowers whilst summer lasts and i live here , fidele , i sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack the flower that like thy face , pale primrose , nor the azured harebell , like thy veins , no , nor the leaf of eglantine , whom not to slander , not thy breath the ruddock would , with charitable bill , o bill , those heirs that let their fathers lie without a monument ! bring thee all this , yea , and furr moss besides , when flowers are none , to thy corse .
prithee , have done , and do not play in words with that which is so serious .
let us bury him , and not protract with admiration what is now due debt .
to the grave !
say , where shall lay him ?
by good euriphile , our mother .
so and let us , polydore , though now our voices have got the mannish crack , sing him to the ground , as once our mother , use like note and words , save that euriphile must be fidele .
cadwal , i can not sing i weep , and word it with thee , for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse than priests and fanes that lie .
we speak it , then .
great griefs , i see , medicine the less , for cloten is quite forgot .
he was a queen son , boys , and though he came our enemy , remember he was paid for that though mean and mighty , rotting together , have one dust , yet reverence , that angel of the world , doth make distinction of place high and low .
our foe was princely and though you took his life , as being our foe , yet bury him as a prince .
pray you , fetch him hither .
thersites ' body is as good as ajax ' , when neither are alive .
if you go fetch him , we say our song the whilst .
brother , begin .
exit belarius nay , cadwal , we must lay his head to the east , my father hath a reason .
is true .
come on then , and remove him .
so .
begin .
song fear no more the heat o ' the sun , nor the furious winter rages , thou thy worldly task hast done , home art gone , and thy wages golden lads and girls all must , as , come to dust .
fear no more the frown o ' the great , thou art past the tyrant stroke , care no more to clothe and eat , to thee the reed is as the oak the sceptre , learning , physic , must all follow this , and come to dust .
fear no more the lightning flash , nor the , fear not slander , censure rash , thou hast finish joy and moan all lovers young , all lovers must consign to thee , and come to dust .
no exorciser harm thee !
nor no witchcraft charm thee !
ghost unlaid forbear thee !
nothing ill come near thee !
quiet consummation have , and renowned be thy grave !
belarius , with the body of cloten we have done our obsequies come , lay him down .
here a few flowers , but midnight , more the herbs that have on them cold dew o ' the night are strewings for graves .
upon their faces .
you were as flowers , now wither even so these herblets shall , which we upon you strew .
come on , away apart upon our knees .
the ground that gave them first has them again their pleasures here are past , so is their pain .
exeunt belarius , guiderius , and arviragus awaking yes , sir , to , which is the way ? i thank by yond bush ? pray , how far thither ?
pittikins !
can it be six mile yet ? i have gone all night .
, i lie down and sleep .
but , soft !
no bedfellow ! o god s and goddesses !
seeing the body of cloten these flowers are like the pleasures of the world , this bloody man , the care o .
i hope i dream , for so i thought i was a , and cook to honest creatures but is not so , was but a bolt of nothing , shot at nothing , which the brain makes of fumes our very eyes are sometimes like our judgments , blind .
good faith , i tremble stiff with fear but if there be yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity as a wren eye , fear gods , a part of it !
the dream here still even when i wake , it is without me , as within me , not imagined , felt .
a headless man !
the garments of posthumus !
i know the shape of leg this is his hand , his foot mercurial , his martial thigh , the brawns of hercules but his jovial face murder in heaven ? how ! is gone .
pisanio , all curses madded hecuba gave the greeks , and mine to boot , be darted on thee !
thou , conspired with that irregulous devil , cloten , hast here cut off my lord .
to write and read be henceforth treacherous !
damn pisanio hath with his forged letters , damn pisanio from this most bravest vessel of the world struck the !
o posthumus !
alas , where is thy head ?
where that ?
ay me !
where that ?
pisanio might have kill thee at the heart , and left this head on .
how should this be ?
pisanio ?
is he and cloten malice and lucre in them have laid this woe here .
o , is pregnant , pregnant !
the drug he gave me , which he said was precious and cordial to me , have i not found it murderous to the senses ?
that confirms it home this is pisanio deed , and cloten o !
give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood , that we the horrider may seem to those which chance to find us o , my lord , my lord !
falls on the body enter lucius , a captain and other officers , and a soothsayer to them the legions garrison in gailia , after your will , have cross the sea , attending you here at with your ships they are in readiness .
but what from rome ?
the senate hath stirr up the confiners and gentlemen of italy , most willing spirits , that promise noble service and they come under the conduct of bold iachimo , syenna brother .
when expect you them ?
with the next benefit o ' the wind .
this forwardness makes our hopes fair .
command our present numbers be muster , bid the captains look .
now , sir , what have you dream of late of this war purpose ?
last night the very gods show me a vision i fast and pray for their intelligence thus i saw jove bird , the roman eagle , wing from the spongy south to this part of the west , there vanish in the sunbeams which portends unless my sins abuse my divination success to the roman host .
dream often so , and never false .
soft , ho !
what trunk is here without his top ?
the ruin speaks that sometime it was a worthy building .
how !
a page !
or dead , or sleeping on him ?
but dead rather , for nature doth abhor to make his bed with the defunct , or sleep upon the dead .
let see the boy face .
he alive , my lord .
he then instruct us of this body .
young one , inform us of thy fortunes , for it seems they crave to be demanded .
who is this thou makest thy bloody pillow ?
or who was he that , otherwise than noble nature did , hath alter that good picture ?
what thy interest in this sad wreck ?
how came it ?
who is it ?
what art thou ?
i am nothing or if not , nothing to be were better .
this was my master , a very valiant briton and a good , that here by mountaineers lies slain .
alas !
there is no more such masters i may wander from east to occident , cry out for service , try many , all good , serve truly , never find such another master .
, good youth !
thou movest no less with thy complaining than thy master in bleeding say his name , good friend .
richard du champ .
aside if i do lie and do no harm by it , though the gods hear , i hope they pardon say you , sir ?
thy name ?
fidele , sir .
thou dost approve thyself the very same thy name well fits thy faith , thy faith thy name .
wilt take thy chance with me ?
i will not say thou shalt be so well master , but , be sure , no less beloved .
the roman emperor letters , sent by a consul to me , should not sooner than thine own worth prefer thee go with me .
i follow , sir .
but first , a please the gods , i hide my master from the flies , as deep as these poor pickaxes can dig , and when with wild and weeds i ha ' strew his grave , and on it said a century of prayers , such as i can , twice , i weep and sigh , and leaving so his service , follow you , so please you entertain me .
ay , good youth !
and rather father thee than master thee .
my friends , the boy hath taught us manly duties let us find out the prettiest daisied plot we can , and make him with our pikes and partisans a grave come , arm him .
boy , he is preferr by thee to us , and he shall be interr as soldiers can .
be cheerful , wipe thine eyes some falls are means the happier to arise .
exeunt scene iii .
a room in cymbeline palace .
enter cymbeline , lords , pisanio , and attendants again , and bring me word how is with her .
exit an attendant a fever with the absence of her son , a madness , of which her life in danger .
heavens , how deeply you at once do touch me !
imogen , the great part of my comfort , gone , my queen upon a desperate bed , and in a time when fearful wars point at me , her son gone , so needful for this present it strikes me , past the hope of comfort .
but for thee , fellow , who needs must know of her departure and dost seem so ignorant , we enforce it from thee by a sharp torture .
sir , my life is yours , i humbly set it at your will , but , for my mistress , i nothing know where she remains , why gone , nor when she purposes return .
beseech your highness , hold me your loyal servant .
good my liege , the day that she was missing he was here i dare be bound he true and shall perform all parts of his subjection loyally .
for cloten , there wants no diligence in seeking him , and will , no doubt , be found .
the time is troublesome .
to pisanio we slip you for a season , but our jealousy does yet depend .
so please your majesty , the roman legions , all from gallia drawn , are landed on your coast , with a supply of roman gentlemen , by the senate sent .
now for the counsel of my son and queen !
i am amazed with matter .
good my liege , your preparation can affront no less than what you hear of come more , for more you ready the want is but to put those powers in motion that long to move .
i thank you .
let withdraw , and meet the time as it seeks us .
we fear not what can from italy annoy us , but we grieve at chances here .
away !
exeunt all but pisanio i heard no letter from my master since i wrote him imogen was slain is strange nor hear i from my mistress who did promise to yield me often tidings neither know i what is betid to cloten , but remain perplex in all .
the heavens still must work .
wherein i am false i am honest , not true , to be true .
these present wars shall find i love my country , even to the note o ' the king , or i fall in them .
all other doubts , by time let them be clear fortune brings in some boats that are not steer .
exit scene iv .
wales before the cave of belarius .
enter belarius , guiderius , and arviragus .
the noise is round about us .
let us from it .
what pleasure , sir , find we in life , to lock it from action and adventure ?
nay , what hope have we in hiding us ?
this way , the romans must or for britons slay us , or receive us for barbarous and unnatural revolts during their use , and slay us after .
sons , we higher to the mountains , there secure us .
to the king party there no going newness of cloten death we being not known , not muster among the bands may drive us to a render where we have lived , and so extort from that which we have done , whose answer would be death drawn on with torture .
this is , sir , a doubt in such a time nothing becoming you , nor satisfying us .
it is not likely that when they hear the roman horses neigh , behold their quarter fires , have both their eyes and ears so cloy importantly as now , that they will waste their time upon our note , to know from whence we are .
o , i am known of many in the army many years , though cloten then but young , you see , not wore him from my remembrance .
and , besides , the king hath not deserved my service nor your loves , who find in my exile the want of breeding , the certainty of this hard life , aye hopeless to have the courtesy your cradle promised , but to be still hot summer tamings and the shrinking slaves of winter .
than be so better to cease to be .
pray , sir , to the army i and my brother are not known , yourself so out of thought , and thereto so , can not be question .
by this sun that shines , i thither what thing is it that i never did see man die !
scarce ever look on blood , but that of coward hares , hot goats , and venison !
never bestrid a horse , save one that had a rider like myself , who wore rowel nor iron on his heel !
i am ashamed to look upon the holy sun , to have the benefit of his blest beams , remaining so long a poor unknown .
by heavens , i go if you will bless me , sir , and give me leave , i take the better care , but if you will not , the hazard therefore due fall on me by the hands of romans !
so say i amen .
no reason i , since of your lives you set so slight a valuation , should reserve my crack one to more care .
have with you , boys !
if in your country wars you chance to die , that is my bed too , lads , an there i lie lead , lead .
aside the time seems long , their blood thinks scorn , till it fly out and show them princes born .
exeunt act v scene britain .
the roman camp .
enter posthumus , with a bloody handkerchief yea , bloody cloth , i keep thee , for i wish thou shouldst be colour thus .
you married ones , if each of you should take this course , how many must murder wives much better than themselves for wrying but a little !
o pisanio !
every good servant does not all commands no bond but to do just ones .
gods !
if you should have vengeance on my faults , i never had lived to put on this so had you saved the noble imogen to repent , and struck me , wretch more worth your vengeance .
but , alack , you snatch some hence for little faults , that love , to have them fall no more you some permit to second ills with ills , each elder worse , and make them dread it , to the doers ' thrift .
but imogen is your own do your best wills , and make me blest to obey !
i am brought hither among the italian gentry , and to fight against my lady kingdom is enough that , britain , i have kill thy mistress , peace !
i give no wound to thee .
therefore , good heavens , hear patiently my purpose i disrobe me of these italian weeds and suit myself as does a briton peasant so i fight against the part i come with , so i die for thee , o imogen , even for whom my life is every breath a death , and thus , unknown , pitied nor hated , to the face of peril myself i dedicate .
let me make men know more valour in me than my habits show .
gods , put the strength o ' the leonati in me !
to shame the guise o ' the world , i will begin the fashion , less without and more within .
exit scene ii .
field of battle between the british and roman camps .
enter , from one side , lucius , iachimo , and the roman army from the other side , the british army , posthumus leonatus following , like a poor soldier .
they march over and go out .
then enter again , in skirmish , iachimo and posthumus leonatus he vanquisheth and disarmeth iachimo , and then leaves him the heaviness and guilt within my bosom takes off my manhood i have belied a lady , the princess of this country , and the air o revengingly enfeebles me , or could this carl , a very drudge of nature , have subdued me in my profession ?
knighthoods and honours , borne as i wear mine , are titles but of scorn .
if that thy gentry , britain , go before this lout as he exceeds our lords , the odds is that we scarce are men and you are gods .
exit the battle continues , the britons fly , cymbeline is taken then enter , to his rescue , belarius , guiderius , and arviragus stand , stand !
we have the advantage of the ground , the lane is guarded nothing routs us but the villany of our fears .
stand , stand , and fight !
posthumus leonatus , and seconds the britons they rescue cymbeline , and exeunt .
then lucius , and iachimo , with imogen away , boy , from the troops , and save thyself , for friends kill friends , and the disorder such as war were hoodwink .
is their fresh supplies .
it is a day turn strangely or betimes let reinforce , or fly .
exeunt scene iii .
another part of the field .
enter posthumus leonatus and a british lord camest thou from where they made the stand ?
i did .
though you , it seems , come from the fliers .
i did .
no blame be to you , sir , for all was lost , but that the heavens fought the king himself of his wings destitute , the army broken , and but the backs of britons seen , all flying through a straight lane , the enemy , lolling the tongue with slaughtering , having work more plentiful than tools to , struck down some mortally , some slightly touch , some falling merely through fear , that the straight pass was damm with dead men hurt behind , and cowards living to die with lengthen shame .
where was this lane ?
close by the battle , ditch , and wall with turf , which gave advantage to an ancient soldier , an honest one , i warrant , who deserved so long a breeding as his white beard came to , in doing this for country athwart the lane , he , with two more like to run the country base than to commit such slaughter with faces fit for masks , or rather fairer than those for preservation cased , or shame made good the passage , cried to those that fled , britain s harts die flying , not our men to darkness fleet souls that fly backwards .
stand , or we are romans and will give you that like beasts which you shun beastly , and may save , but to look back in frown stand , stand . '
these three , three thousand confident , in act as many for three performers are the file when all the rest do nothing with this word , stand , ' accommodated by the place , more charming with their own nobleness , which could have turn a distaff to a lance , gilded pale looks , part shame , part spirit renew , that some , turn coward but by example o , a sin in war , damn in the first beginners ! gan to look the way that they did , and to grin like lions upon the pikes o ' the hunters .
then began a stop i ' the chaser , a retire , anon a rout , confusion thick , forthwith they fly chickens , the way which they stoop eagles , slaves , the strides they victors made and now our cowards , like fragments in hard voyages , became the life o ' the need having found the backdoor open of the unguarded hearts , heavens , how they wound !
some slain before , some dying , some their friends borne i ' the former wave ten , chased by one , are now each one the of twenty those that would die or ere resist are grown the mortal bugs o ' the field .
this was strange chance a narrow lane , an old man , and two boys .
nay , do not wonder at it you are made rather to wonder at the things you hear than to work any .
will you rhyme upo , and vent it for a mockery ?
here is one boys , an old man twice a boy , a lane , preserved the britons , was the romans ' bane . '
nay , be not angry , sir .
, to what end ?
who dares not stand his foe , i be his friend , for if he do as he is made to do , i know he quickly fly my friendship too .
you have put me into rhyme .
farewell , you angry .
still going ?
exit lord this is a lord !
o noble misery , to be i ' the field , and ask news ? '
of me !
how many would have given their honours to have saved their carcasses !
took heel to , and yet died too !
i , in mine own woe charm , could not find death where i did hear him groan , nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster , is strange he hides him in fresh cups , soft beds , sweet words , or hath more ministers than we that draw his knives i ' the war .
well , i will find him for being now a favourer to the briton , no more a briton , i have resumed again the part i came in fight i will no more , but yield me to the veriest hind that shall once touch my shoulder .
great the slaughter is here made by the roman , great the answer be britons must take .
for me , my ransom death , on either side i come to spend my breath , which neither here i keep nor bear again , but end it by some means for imogen .
enter two british captains and soldiers great jupiter be praised !
lucius is taken .
is thought the old man and his sons were angels .
there was a fourth man , in a silly habit , that gave the affront with them .
so is reported but none of can be found .
stand !
who there ?
a roman , who had not now been drooping here , if seconds had answer him .
lay hands on him , a dog !

for thou art away , think , to liberty yet am i better than one that sick o ' the gout , since he had rather groan so in perpetuity than be cured by the sure physician , death , who is the key to unbar these locks .
my conscience , thou art fetter more than my shanks and wrists you good gods , give me the penitent instrument to pick that bolt , then , free for ever !
enough i am sorry ?
so children temporal fathers do appease , gods are more full of mercy .
must i repent ?
i can not do it better than in gyves , desired more than constrain to satisfy , if of my freedom is the main part , take no stricter render of me than my all .
i know you are more clement than vile men , who of their broken debtors take a third , a sixth , a tenth , letting them thrive again on their abatement that not my desire for imogen dear life take mine , and though is not so dear , yet is a life , you coin it man and man they weigh not every stamp , though light , take pieces for the figure sake you rather mine , being yours and so , great powers , if you will take this audit , take this life , and cancel these cold bonds .
o imogen !
i speak to thee in silence .
sleeps solemn music .
enter , as in an apparition , sicilius leonatus , father to posthumus leonatus , an old man , attired like a warrior , leading in his hand an ancient matron , his wife , and mother to posthumus leonatus , with music before them then , after other music , follow the two young leonati , brothers to posthumus leonatus , with wounds as they died in the wars .
they circle posthumus leonatus round , as he lies sleeping no more , thou , show thy spite on mortal flies with mars fall out , with juno chide , that thy adulteries rates and revenges .
hath my poor boy done aught but well , whose face i never saw ?
i died whilst in the womb he stay attending nature law whose father then , as men report thou orphans ' father art , thou shouldst have been , and shielded him from this smart .
lucina lent not me her aid , but took me in my throes , that from me was posthumus ript , came crying his foes , a thing of pity !
great nature , like his ancestry , moulded the stuff so fair , that he deserved the praise o ' the world , as great sicilius ' heir .
when once he was mature for man , in britain where was he that could stand up his parallel , or fruitful object be in eye of imogen , that best could deem his dignity ?
with marriage wherefore was he mock , to be exiled , and thrown from leonati seat , and cast from her his dearest one , sweet imogen ?
why did you suffer iachimo , slight thing of italy , to taint his nobler heart and brain with needless jealosy , and to become the geck and scorn o ' th ' other villany ?
for this from stiller seats we came , our parents and us twain , that striking in our country cause fell bravely and were slain , our fealty and tenantius ' right with honour to maintain .
like hardiment posthumus hath to cymbeline perform then , jupiter , thou king of gods , why hast thou thus adjourn the graces for his merits due , being all to dolours turn ?
thy crystal window ope , look out , no longer exercise upon a valiant race thy harsh and potent injuries .
since , jupiter , our son is good , take off his miseries .
peep through thy marble mansion , help , or we poor ghosts will cry to the shining synod of the rest against thy deity .
help , jupiter , or we appeal , and from thy justice fly .
jupiter descends in thunder and lightning , sitting upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt .
the apparitions fall on their knees no more , you petty spirits of region low , offend our hearing , hush !
how dare you ghosts accuse the thunderer , whose bolt , you know , batters all rebelling coasts ?
poor shadows of elysium , hence , and rest upon your banks of flowers be not with mortal accidents opprest , no care of yours it is , you know is ours .
whom best i love i cross , to make my gift , the more delay , delighted .
be content , your son our godhead will uplift his comforts thrive , his trials well are spent .
our jovial star reign at his birth , and in our temple was he married .
rise , and fade .
he shall be lord of lady imogen , and happier much by his affliction made .
this tablet lay upon his breast , wherein our pleasure his full fortune doth confine and so , away no further with your din express impatience , lest you stir up mine .
mount , eagle , to my palace crystalline .
ascends he came in thunder , his celestial breath was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle stoop as to foot us his ascension is more sweet than our blest fields his royal bird prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak , as when his god is pleased .
thanks , jupiter !
the marble pavement closes , he is enter his radiant root .
away !
and , to be blest , let us with care perform his great behest .
the apparitions vanish waking sleep , thou hast been a grandsire , and begot a father to me , and thou hast created a mother and two brothers but , o scorn !
gone !
they went hence so soon as they were born and so i am awake .
poor wretches that depend on greatness ' favour dream as i have done , wake and find nothing .
but , alas , i swerve many dream not to find , neither deserve , and yet are steep in favours so am i , that have this golden chance and know not why .
what fairies haunt this ground ?
a book ?
o rare one !
be not , as is our fangled world , a garment nobler than that it covers let thy effects so follow , to be most unlike our courtiers , as good as promise .
reads as a lion whelp shall , to himself unknown , without seeking find , and be embraced by a piece of tender air , and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches , which , being dead many years , shall after revive , be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow , then shall posthumus end his miseries , britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty . '
is still a dream , or else such stuff as madmen tongue and brain not , either both or nothing , or senseless speaking or a speaking such as sense can not untie .
be what it is , the action of my life is like it , which i keep , if but for sympathy .
first gaoler come , sir , are you ready for death ?
rather , ready long ago .
hanging is the word , sir if you be ready for that , you are well cooked .
so , if i prove a good repast to the spectators , the dish pays the shot .
a heavy reckoning for you , sir .
but the comfort is , you shall be called to no more payments , fear no more , which are often the sadness of parting , as the procuring of mirth you come in flint for want of meat , depart reeling with too much drink , sorry that you have paid too much , and sorry that you are paid too much , purse and brain both empty , the brain the heavier for being too light , the purse too light , being drawn of heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be quit .
o , the charity of a penny cord !
it sums up thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and creditor but it , of what past , is , and to come , the discharge your neck , sir , is pen , book and counters , so the acquittance follows .
i am merrier to die than thou art to live .
indeed , sir , he that sleeps feels not the but a man that were to sleep your sleep , and a hangman to help him to bed , i think he would change places with his officer , for , look you , sir , you know not which way you shall go .
yes , indeed do i , fellow .
your death has eyes in head then , i have not seen him so pictured you must either be directed by some that take upon them to know , or do take upon yourself that which i am sure you do not know , or jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how you shall speed in your journey end , i think you never return to tell one .
i tell thee , fellow , there are none want eyes to direct them the way i am going , but such as wink and will not use them .
what an infinite mock is this , that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness !
i am sure hanging the way of winking .
enter a messenger knock off his manacles , bring your prisoner to the king .
thou good news , i am called to be made free .
i be hang then .
thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler , no bolts for the dead .
exeunt posthumus leonatus and messenger unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets , i never saw one so prone .
yet , on my conscience , there are verier knaves desire to live , for all he be a roman and there be some of them too that die against their wills , so should i , if i were one .
i would we were all of one mind , and one mind good , o , there were desolation of gaolers and gallowses !
i speak against my present profit , but my wish hath a preferment in .
exeunt scene cymbeline tent .
enter cymbeline , belarius , guiderius , arviragus , pisanio , lords , officers , and attendants stand by my side , you whom the gods have made preservers of my throne .
woe is my heart that the poor soldier that so richly fought , whose rags shamed gilded arms , whose naked breast stepp before larges of proof , can not be found he shall be happy that can find him , if our grace can make him so .
i never saw such noble fury in so poor a thing , such precious deeds in one that promises nought but beggary and poor looks .
no tidings of him ?
he hath been search among the dead and living , but no trace of him .
to my grief , i am the heir of his reward , to belarius , guiderius , and arviragus which i will add to you , the liver , heart and brain of britain , by whom i grant she lives .
is now the time to ask of whence you are .
report it .
sir , in cambria are we born , and gentlemen further to boast were neither true nor modest , unless i add , we are honest .
bow your knees .
arise my knights o ' the battle i create you companions to our person and will fit you with dignities becoming your estates .
enter cornelius and ladies there business in these faces .
why so sadly greet you our victory ?
you look like romans , and not o ' the court of britain .
hail , great king !
to sour your happiness , i must report the queen is dead .
who worse than a physician would this report become ?
but i consider , by medicine life may be prolong , yet death will seize the doctor too .
how ended she ?
with horror , madly dying , like her life , which , being cruel to the world , concluded most cruel to herself .
what she confess i will report , so please you these her women can trip me , if i err , who with wet cheeks were present when she finish .
prithee , say .
first , she confess she never loved you , only affected greatness got by you , not you married your royalty , was wife to your place , abhorr your person .
she alone knew this , and , but she spoke it dying , i would not believe her lips in opening it .
proceed .
your daughter , whom she bore in hand to love with such integrity , she did confess was as a scorpion to her sight , whose life , but that her flight prevented it , she had off by poison .
o most delicate fiend !
who is can read a woman ?
is there more ?
more , sir , and worse .
she did confess she had for you a mortal mineral , which , being took , should by the minute feed on life and lingering by inches waste you in which time she purposed , by watching , weeping , tendance , kissing , to you with her show , and in time , when she had fitted you with her craft , to work her son into the adoption of the crown but , failing of her end by his strange absence , grew , open , in despite of heaven and men , her purposes , repented the evils she hatch were not effected , so despairing died .
heard you all this , her women ?
we did , so please your highness .
mine eyes were not in fault , for she was beautiful , mine ears , that heard her flattery , nor my heart , that thought her like her seeming , it had been vicious to have mistrusted her yet , o my daughter !
that it was folly in me , thou mayst say , and prove it in thy feeling .
heaven mend all !
enter lucius , iachimo , the soothsayer , and other roman prisoners , guarded , posthumus leonatus behind , and imogen thou comest not , caius , now for tribute that the britons have razed out , though with the loss of many a bold one , whose kinsmen have made suit that their good souls may be appeased with slaughter of you their captives , which ourself have granted so think of your estate .
consider , sir , the chance of war the day was yours by accident , had it gone with us , we should not , when the blood was cool , have threaten our prisoners with the sword .
but since the gods will have it thus , that nothing but our lives may be call ransom , let it come sufficeth a roman with a roman heart can suffer augustus lives to think o and so much for my peculiar care .
this one thing only i will entreat , my boy , a briton born , let him be ransom never master had a page so kind , so duteous , diligent , so tender over his occasions , true , so feat , so let his virtue join with my request , which i make bold your highness can not deny , he hath done no briton harm , though he have served a roman save him , sir , and spare no blood beside .
i have surely seen him his favour is familiar to me .
boy , thou hast look thyself into my grace , and art mine own .
i know not why , wherefore , to say , boy ' thank thy master , live and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt , fitting my bounty and thy state , i give it , yea , though thou do demand a prisoner , the noblest .
i humbly thank your highness .
i do not bid thee beg my life , good lad , and yet i know thou wilt .
no , no alack , there other work in hand i see a thing bitter to me as death your life , good master , must shuffle for itself .
the boy disdains me , he leaves me , scorns me briefly die their joys that place them on the truth of girls and boys .
why stands he so perplex ?
what wouldst thou , boy ?
i love thee more and more think more and more what best to ask .
him thou on ?
speak , wilt have him live ?
is he thy kin ?
thy friend ?
he is a roman , no more kin to me than i to your highness , who , being born your vassal , am something nearer .
wherefore eyest him so ?
i tell you , sir , in private , if you please to give me hearing .
ay , with all my heart , and lend my best attention .
what thy name ?
fidele , sir .
my good youth , my page , i be thy master walk with me , speak freely .
cymbeline and imogen converse apart is not this boy revived from death ?
one sand another not more resembles that sweet rosy lad who died , and was fidele .
what think you ?
the same dead thing alive .
peace , peace !
see further , he eyes us not , forbear , creatures may be alike were he , i am sure he would have spoke to us .
but we saw him dead .
be silent , let see further .
aside it is my mistress since she is living , let the time run on to good or bad .
cymbeline and imogen come forward come , stand thou by our side , make thy demand aloud .
to iachimo sir , step you forth , give answer to this boy , and do it freely , or , by our greatness and the grace of it , which is our honour , bitter torture shall winnow the truth from falsehood .
on , speak to him .
my boon is , that this gentleman may render of whom he had this ring .
aside what that to him ?
that diamond upon your finger , say how came it yours ?
torture me to leave unspoken that which , to be spoke , would torture thee .
how !
me ?
i am glad to be constrain to utter that which torments me to conceal .
by villany i got this ring was leonatus ' jewel , whom thou didst banish , and which more may grieve thee , as it doth me a nobler sir lived sky and ground .
wilt thou hear more , my lord ?
all that belongs to this .
that paragon , thy daughter , for whom my heart drops blood , and my false spirits quail to remember give me leave , i faint .
my daughter !
what of her ?
renew thy strength i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will than die ere i hear more strive , man , and speak .
upon a time , unhappy was the clock that struck the hour ! it was in rome , accursed the mansion where ! was at a feast , o , would our viands had been poison , or at least those which i heaved to head ! the good posthumus what should i say ?
he was too good to be where ill men were , and was the best of all amongst the rarest of good ones , sitting sadly , hearing us praise our loves of italy for beauty that made barren the swell boast of him that best could speak , for feature , laming the shrine of venus , or minerva .
postures beyond brief nature , for condition , a shop of all the qualities that man loves woman for , besides that hook of wiving , fairness which strikes the eye i stand on fire come to the matter .
all too soon i shall , unless thou wouldst grieve quickly .
this posthumus , most like a noble lord in love and one that had a royal lover , took his hint , and , not dispraising whom we praised , therein he was as calm as virtue he began his mistress ' picture , which by his tongue being made , and then a mind put i , either our brags were crack of , or his description proved us unspeaking sots .
nay , nay , to the purpose .
your daughter chastity there it begins .
he spake of her , as dian had hot dreams , and she alone were cold whereat i , wretch , made scruple of his praise , and wager with him pieces of gold this which then he wore upon his honour finger , to attain in suit the place of bed and win this ring by hers and mine adultery .
he , true knight , no lesser of her honour confident than i did truly find her , stakes this ring , and would so , had it been a carbuncle of phoebus ' wheel , and might so safely , had it been all the worth of car .
away to britain post i in this design well may you , sir , remember me at court , where i was taught of your chaste daughter the wide difference amorous and villanous .
being thus quench of hope , not longing , mine italian brain in your duller britain operate most vilely , for my vantage , excellent and , to be brief , my practise so prevail , that i return with simular proof enough to make the noble leonatus mad , by wounding his belief in her renown with tokens thus , and thus , averting notes of , pictures , this her bracelet , o cunning , how i got it ! nay , some marks of secret on her person , that he could not but think her bond of chastity quite crack , i having the forfeit .
whereupon methinks , i see him now advancing ay , so thou dost , italian fiend !
ay me , most credulous fool , egregious murderer , thief , any thing that due to all the villains past , in being , to come !
o , give me cord , or knife , or poison , some upright justicer !
thou , king , send out for torturers ingenious it is i that all the abhorred things o ' the earth amend by being worse than they .
i am posthumus , that kill thy daughter , i lie that caused a lesser villain than myself , a sacrilegious thief , to the temple of virtue was she , yea , and she herself .
spit , and throw stone s , cast mire upon me , set the dogs o ' the street to bay me every villain be call posthumus leonitus , and be villany less than was !
o imogen !
my queen , my life , my wife !
o imogen , imogen , imogen !
peace , my lord , hear , hear shall have a play of this ?
thou scornful page , there lie thy part .
striking her she falls o , gentlemen , help !
mine and your mistress !
o , my lord posthumus !
you kill imogen til now .
help , help !
mine honour lady !
does the world go round ?
how come these staggers on me ?
wake , my mistress !
if this be so , the gods do mean to strike me to death with mortal joy .
how fares thy mistress ?
o , get thee from my sight , thou gavest me poison dangerous fellow , hence !
breathe not where princes are .
the tune of imogen !
lady , the gods throw stones of sulphur on me , if that box i gave you was not thought by me a precious thing i had it from the queen .
new matter still ?
it poison me .
o gods !
i left out one thing which the queen confess .
which must approve thee honest pisanio have , ' said she , his mistress that confection which i gave him for cordial , she is served as i would serve a rat . '
what this , comelius ?
the queen , sir , very oft importuned me to temper poisons for her , still pretending the satisfaction of her knowledge only in killing creatures vile , as cats and dogs , of no esteem i , dreading that her purpose was of more danger , did compound for her a certain stuff , which , being , would cease the present power of life , but in short time all offices of nature should again do their due functions .
have you of it ?
most like i did , for i was dead .
my boys , there was our error .
this is , sure , fidele .
why did you throw your wedded lady from you ?
think that you are upon a rock , and now throw me again .
embracing him hang there like a fruit , my soul , till the tree die !
how now , my flesh , my child !
what , makest thou me a dullard in this act ?
wilt thou not speak to me ?
kneeling your blessing , sir .
to guiderius and arviragus though you did love this youth , i blame ye not you had a motive .
my tears that fall prove holy water on thee !
imogen , thy mother dead .
i am sorry , my lord .
o , she was nought , and long of her it was that we meet here so strangely but her son is gone , we know not how nor where .
my lord , now fear is from me , i speak troth .
lord cloten , upon my lady missing , came to me with his sword drawn , foam at the mouth , and swore , if i discover not which way she was gone , it was my instant death .
by accident , had a feigned letter of my master then in my pocket , which directed him to seek her on the mountains near to milford , where , in a frenzy , in my master garments , which he enforced from me , away he posts with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate my lady honour what became of him i further know not .
let me end the story i slew him there .
marry , the gods forfend !
i would not thy good deeds should from my lips pluck a bard sentence prithee , valiant youth , again .
i have spoke it , and i did it .
he was a prince .
a most incivil one the wrongs he did me were nothing , for he did provoke me with language that would make me spurn the sea , if it could so roar to me i cut off head , and am right glad he is not standing here to tell this tale of mine .
i am sorry for thee by thine own tongue thou art condemn , and must endure our law dead .
that headless man i thought had been my lord .
bind the offender , and take him from our presence .
stay , sir king this man is better than the man he slew , as well descended as thyself , and hath more of thee merited than a band of clotens had ever scar for .
to the guard let his arms alone , they were not born for bondage .
why , old soldier , wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for , by tasting of our wrath ?
how of descent as good as we ?
in that he spake too far .
and thou shalt die .
we will die all three but i will prove that two on are as good as i have given out him .
my sons , i must , for mine own part , unfold a dangerous speech , though , haply , well for you .
your danger ours .
and our good his .
have at it then , by leave .
thou hadst , great king , a subject who was call belarius .
what of him ?
he is a banish traitor .
he it is that hath assumed this age , indeed a banish man , i know not how a traitor .
take him hence the whole world shall not save him .
not too hot first pay me for the nursing of thy sons , and let it be confiscate all , so soon as i have received it .
nursing of my sons !
i am too blunt and saucy here my knee ere i arise , i will prefer my sons , then spare not the old father .
mighty sir , these two young gentlemen , that call me father and think they are my sons , are none of mine , they are the issue of your loins , my liege , and blood of your begetting .
how !
my issue !
so sure as you your father .
i , old morgan , am that belarius whom you sometime banish your pleasure was my mere offence , my punishment itself , and all my treason , that i suffer was all the harm i did .
these gentle princes for such and so they are these twenty years have i train up those arts they have as i could put into them , my breeding was , sir , as your highness knows .
their nurse , euriphile , whom for the theft i wedded , stole these children upon my banishment i moved her , having received the punishment before , for that which i did then beaten for loyalty excited me to treason their dear loss , the more of you was felt , the more it shaped unto my end of stealing them .
but , gracious sir , here are your sons again , and i must lose two of the companions in the world .
the benediction of these covering heavens fall on their heads like dew !
for they are worthy to inlay heaven with stars .
thou , and .
the service that you three have done is more unlike than this thou .
i lost my children if these be they , i know not how to wish a pair of worthier sons .
be pleased awhile .
this gentleman , whom i call polydore , most worthy prince , as yours , is true guiderius this gentleman , my cadwal , arviragus , your younger princely son , he , sir , was lapp in a most curious mantle , wrought by the hand of his queen mother , which for more probation i can with ease produce .
guiderius had upon his neck a mole , a sanguine star , it was a mark of wonder .
this is he , who hath upon him still that natural stamp it was wise nature end in the donation , to be his evidence now .
o , what , am i a mother to the birth of three ?
mother rejoiced deliverance more .
blest pray you be , that , after this strange starting from your orbs , may reign in them now !
o imogen , thou hast lost by this a kingdom .
no , my lord , i have got two worlds by .
o my gentle brothers , have we thus met ?
o , never say hereafter but i am truest speaker you call me brother , when i was but your sister , i you brothers , when ye were so indeed .
did you meet ?
ay , my good lord .
and at first meeting loved , continued so , until we thought he died .
by the queen dram she swallow .
o rare instinct !
when shall i hear all through ?
this fierce abridgement hath to it circumstantial branches , which distinction should be rich in .
where ?
how lived you ?
and when came you to serve our roman captive ?
how parted with your brothers ?
how first met them ?
why fled you from the court ?
and whither ?
these , and your three motives to the battle , with i know not how much more , should be demanded , and all the other , from chance to chance but nor the time nor place will serve our long .
see , posthumus anchors upon imogen , and she , like harmless lightning , throws her eye on him , her brother , me , her master , hitting each object with a joy the counterchange is severally in all .
let quit this ground , and smoke the temple with our sacrifices .
to belarius thou art my brother , so we hold thee ever .
you are my father too , and did relieve me , to see this gracious season .
all , save these in bonds let them be joyful too , for they shall taste our comfort .
my good master , i will yet do you service .
happy be you !
the forlorn soldier , that so nobly fought , he would have well becomed this place , and graced the thankings of a king .
i am , sir , the soldier that did company these three in poor beseeming , was a fitment for the purpose i then follow .
that i was he , speak , iachimo i had you down and might have made you finish .
kneeling i am down again but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee , as then your force did .
take that life , beseech you , which i so often owe but your ring first , and here the bracelet of the truest princess that ever swore her faith .
kneel not to me the power that i have on you is , to spare you , the malice towards you to forgive you live , and deal with others better .
nobly doom !
we learn our freeness of a , pardon the word to all .
you holp us , sir , as you did mean indeed to be our brother , joy are we that you are .
your servant , princes .
good my lord of rome , call forth your soothsayer as i slept , methought great jupiter , upon his eagle back , appear to me , with other spritely shows of mine own kindred when i waked , i found this label on my bosom , whose containing is so from sense in hardness , that i can make no collection of it let him show his skill in the construction .
philarmonus !
here , my good lord .
read , and declare the meaning .
reads as a lion whelp shall , to himself unknown , without seeking find , and be embraced by a piece of tender air , and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches , which , being dead many years , shall after revive , be jointed to the old stock , and freshly grow , then shall posthumus end his miseries , britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty . '
thou , leonatus , art the lion whelp , the fit and apt construction of thy name , being leonatus , doth import so much .
to cymbeline the piece of tender air , thy virtuous daughter , which we call aer , ' and aer ' we term it ' which ' i divine is this most constant wife , who , even now , answering the letter of the oracle , unknown to you , unsought , were clipp about with this most tender air .
this hath some seeming .
the lofty cedar , royal cymbeline , personates thee and thy lopp branches point thy two sons forth , who , by belarius , for many years thought dead , are now revived , to the majestic cedar join , whose issue promises britain peace and plenty .
well my peace we will begin .
and , caius lucius , although the victor , we submit to caesar , and to the roman empire , promising to pay our wonted tribute , from the which we were dissuaded by our wicked queen , whom heavens , in justice , both on her and hers , have laid most heavy hand .
the fingers of the powers above do tune the harmony of this peace .
the vision which i made known to lucius , ere the stroke of this yet battle , at this instant is full accomplish , for the roman eagle , from south to west on wing soaring aloft , lessen herself , and in the beams o ' the sun so vanish which foreshow our princely eagle , the imperial caesar , should again unite his favour with the radiant cymbeline , which shines here in the west .
laud we the gods , and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils from our blest altars .
publish we this peace to all our subjects .
set we forward let a roman and a british ensign wave friendly together so through march and in the temple of great jupiter our peace we ratify , seal it with feasts .
set on there !
never was a war did cease , ere bloody hands were wash , with such a peace .
exeunt act i scene elsinore .
a platform before the castle .
francisco at his post .
enter to him bernardo who there ?
nay , answer me stand , and unfold yourself .
long live the king !
bernardo ?
he .
you come most carefully upon your hour .
is now struck twelve , get thee to bed , francisco .
for this relief much thanks is bitter cold , and i am sick at heart .
have you had quiet guard ?
not a mouse stirring .
well , good night .
if you do meet horatio and marcellus , the rivals of my watch , bid them make haste .
i think i hear them .
stand , ho !
who there ?
enter horatio and marcellus friends to this ground .
and liegemen to the dane .
give you good night .
o , farewell , honest soldier who hath relieved you ?
bernardo has my place .
give you good night .
exit holla !
bernardo !
say , what , is horatio there ?
a piece of him .
welcome , horatio welcome , good marcellus .
what , has this thing appear again ?
i have seen nothing .
horatio says is but our fantasy , and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight , twice seen of us therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night , that if again this apparition come , he may approve our eyes and speak to it .
tush , tush , not appear .
sit down awhile , and let us once again assail your ears , that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen .
well , sit we down , and let us hear bernardo speak of this .
last night of all , when yond same star that westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns , marcellus and myself , the bell then beating one , enter ghost peace , break thee off , look , where it comes again !
in the same figure , like the king that dead .
thou art a scholar , speak to it , horatio .
looks it not like the king ?
mark it , horatio .
most like it harrows me with fear and wonder .
it would be spoke to .
question it , horatio .
what art thou that this time of night , together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march ?
by heaven i charge thee , speak !
it is offended .
see , it stalks away !
stay !
speak , speak !
i charge thee , speak !
exit ghost is gone , and will not answer .
how now , horatio !
you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy ?
what think you o ?
before my god , i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes .
is it not like the king ?
as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated , so frown he once , when , in an angry parle , he smote the sledded polacks on the ice .
is strange .
thus twice before , and jump at this dead hour , with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch .
in what particular thought to work i know not , but in the gross and scope of my opinion , this bodes some strange eruption to our state .
good now , sit down , and tell me , he that knows , why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land , and why such daily cast of brazen cannon , and foreign mart for implements of war , why such impress of shipwrights , whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week , what might be toward , that this sweaty haste doth make the night with the day who that can inform me ?
that can i , at least , the whisper goes so .
our last king , whose image even but now appear to us , was , as you know , by fortinbras of norway , thereto prick on by a most emulate pride , dared to the combat , in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem him did slay this fortinbras , who by a seal compact , well ratified by law and heraldry , did forfeit , with his life , all those his lands which he stood seized of , to the conqueror against the which , a moiety competent was gaged by our king , which had return to the inheritance of fortinbras , had he been vanquisher , as , by the same covenant , and carriage of the article design , his fell to hamlet .
now , sir , young fortinbras , of unimproved mettle hot and full , hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark up a list of lawless resolutes , for food and diet , to some enterprise that hath a stomach i , which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us , by strong hand and terms compulsatory , those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this , i take it , is the main motive of our preparations , the source of this our watch and the chief head of this and romage in the land .
i think it be no other but so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch , so like the king that was and is the question of these wars .
a mote it is to trouble the mind eye .
in the most high and palmy state of rome , a little ere the mightiest julius fell , the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , disasters in the sun , and the moist star upon whose influence neptune empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events , as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on , have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and but soft , behold !
lo , where it comes again !
ghost i cross it , though it blast me .
stay , illusion !
if thou hast any sound , or use of voice , speak to me if there be any good thing to be done , that may to thee do ease and grace to me , speak to me cock crows if thou art privy to thy country fate , which , happily , foreknowing may avoid , o , speak !
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth , for which , they say , you spirits oft walk in death , speak of it stay , and speak !
stop it , marcellus .
shall i strike at it with my partisan ?
do , if it will not stand .
is here !
is here !
is gone !
exit ghost we do it wrong , being so majestical , to offer it the show of violence , for it is , as the air , invulnerable , and our vain blows malicious mockery .
it was about to speak , when the cock crew .
and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons .
i have heard , the cock , that is the trumpet to the morn , doth with his lofty and throat awake the god of day , and , at his warning , whether in sea or fire , in earth or air , the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation .
it faded on the crowing of the cock .
some say that ever that season comes wherein our saviour birth is celebrated , the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then , they say , no spirit dares stir abroad , the nights are wholesome , then no planets strike , no fairy takes , nor witch hath power to charm , so hallow and so gracious is the time .
so have i heard and do in part believe it .
but , look , the morn , in russet mantle clad , walks the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up , and by my advice , let us impart what we have seen unto young hamlet , for , upon my life , this spirit , dumb to us , will speak to him .
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , as needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?
let , i pray , and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently .
exeunt scene ii .
a room of state in the castle .
enter king claudius , queen gertrude , hamlet , polonius , laertes , voltimand , cornelius , lords , and attendants though yet of hamlet our dear brother death the memory be green , and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe , yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him , together with remembrance of ourselves .
therefore our sometime sister , now our queen , the imperial jointress to this warlike state , have we , as with a defeated joy , with an auspicious and a dropping eye , with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage , in equal scale weighing delight and dole , taken to wife nor have we herein barr your better wisdoms , which have freely gone with this affair along .
for all , our thanks .
now follows , that you know , young fortinbras , holding a weak supposal of our worth , or thinking by our late dear brother death our state to be disjoint and out of frame , colleagued with the dream of his advantage , he hath not fail to pester us with message , importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father , with all bonds of law , to our most valiant brother .
so much for him .
now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway , uncle of young fortinbras , who , impotent and , scarcely hears of this his nephew purpose , to suppress his further gait herein , in that the levies , the lists and full proportions , are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you , good cornelius , and you , voltimand , for bearers of this greeting to old norway , giving to you no further personal power to business with the king , more than the scope of these delated articles allow .
farewell , and let your haste commend your duty .
in that and all things will we show our duty .
we doubt it nothing heartily farewell .
exeunt voltimand and cornelius and now , laertes , what the news with you ?
you told us of some suit , what , laertes ?
you can not speak of reason to the dane , and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg , laertes , that shall not be my offer , not thy asking ?
the head is not more native to the heart , the hand more instrumental to the mouth , than is the throne of denmark to thy father .
what wouldst thou have , laertes ?
my dread lord , your leave and favour to return to france , from whence though willingly i came to denmark , to show my duty in your coronation , yet now , i must confess , that duty done , my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon .
have you your father leave ?
what says polonius ?
he hath , my lord , wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition , and at last upon his will i seal my hard consent i do beseech you , give him leave to go .
take thy fair hour , laertes , time be thine , and thy best graces spend it at thy will !
but now , my cousin hamlet , and my son , aside a little more than kin , and less than kind .
how is it that the clouds still hang on you ?
not so , my lord , i am too much i ' the sun .
good hamlet , cast thy nighted colour off , and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark .
do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou is common , all that lives must die , passing through nature to eternity .
ay , madam , it is common .
if it be , why seems it so particular with thee ?
seems , madam !
nay it is , i know not . '
is not alone my inky cloak , good mother , nor customary suits of solemn black , nor windy suspiration of forced breath , no , nor the fruitful river in the eye , nor the dejected of the visage , together with all forms , moods , shapes of grief , that can denote me truly these indeed seem , for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show , these but the trappings and the suits of woe .
is sweet and commendable in your nature , hamlet , to give these mourning duties to your father but , you must know , your father lost a father , that father lost , lost his , and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness , is unmanly grief , it shows a will most incorrect to heaven , a heart unfortified , a mind impatient , an understanding simple and unschool for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense , why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart ?
fie !
is a fault to heaven , a fault against the dead , a fault to nature , to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers , and who still hath cried , from the first corse till he that died , must be so . '
we pray you , throw to earth this unprevailing woe , and think of us as of a father for let the world take note , you are the most immediate to our throne , and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son , do i impart toward you .
for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg , it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you , bend you to remain here , in the cheer and comfort of our eye , our chiefest courtier , cousin , and our son .
let not thy mother lose her prayers , hamlet i pray thee , stay with us , go not to wittenberg .
i shall in all my best obey you , madam .
why , is a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark .
madam , come , this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof , no jocund health that denmark drinks , but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell , and the king rouse the heavens all bruit again , earthly thunder .
come away .
exeunt all but hamlet o , that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew !
or that the everlasting had not fix his canon !
o god !
god !
how weary , stale , flat and unprofitable , seem to me all the uses of this world !
fie o !
ah fie !
is an unweeded garden , that grows to seed , things rank and gross in nature possess it merely .
that it should come to this !
but two months dead nay , not so much , not two so excellent a king , that was , to this , hyperion to a satyr , so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly .
heaven and earth !
must i remember ?
why , she would hang on him , as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet , within a month let me not think o frailty , thy name is woman ! a little month , or ere those shoes were old with which she follow my poor father body , like niobe , all tears why she , even she o , god !
a beast , that wants discourse of reason , would have mourn longer married with my uncle , my father brother , but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes , she married .
o , most wicked speed , to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets !
it is not nor it can not come to good but break , my heart , for i must hold my tongue .
enter horatio , marcellus , and bernardo hail to your lordship !
i am glad to see you well horatio , or i do forget myself .
the same , my lord , and your poor servant ever .
sir , my good friend , i change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg , horatio ?
marcellus ?
my good lord i am very glad to see you .
good even , sir .
but what , in faith , make you from wittenberg ?
a truant disposition , good my lord .
i would not hear your enemy say so , nor shall you do mine ear that violence , to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant .
but what is your affair in elsinore ?
we teach you to drink deep ere you depart .
my lord , i came to see your father funeral .
i pray thee , do not mock me , , i think it was to see my mother wedding .
indeed , my lord , it follow hard upon .
thrift , thrift , horatio !
the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables .
would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day , horatio !
my father ! methinks i see my father .
where , my lord ?
in my mind eye , horatio .
i saw him once , he was a goodly king .
he was a man , take him for all in all , i shall not look upon his like again .
my lord , i think i saw him yesternight .
saw ?
who ?
my lord , the king your father .
the king my father !
season your admiration for awhile with an attent ear , till i may deliver , upon the witness of these gentlemen , this marvel to you .
for god love , let me hear .
two nights together had these gentlemen , marcellus and bernardo , on their watch , in the dead vast and middle of the night , been thus encounter .
a figure like your father , armed at point exactly , , appears before them , and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk by their oppress and eyes , within his truncheon length , whilst they , distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear , stand dumb and speak not to him .
this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did , and i with them the third night kept the watch , where , as they had deliver , both in time , form of the thing , each word made true and good , the apparition comes i knew your father , these hands are not more like .
but where was this ?
my lord , upon the platform where we watch .
did you not speak to it ?
my lord , i did , but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion , like as it would speak , but even then the morning cock crew loud , and at the sound it shrunk in haste away , and vanish from our sight .
is very strange .
as i do live , my honour lord , is true , and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it .
indeed , indeed , sirs , but this troubles me .
hold you the watch ?
we do , my lord .
arm , say you ?
arm , my lord .
from top to toe ?
my lord , from head to foot .
then saw you not his face ?
o , yes , my lord , he wore his beaver up .
what , look he frowningly ?
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger .
pale or red ?
nay , very pale .
and fix his eyes upon you ?
most constantly .
i would i had been there .
it would have much amazed you .
very like , very like .
stay it long ?
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred .
longer , longer .
not when i .
his beard was grizzled no ?
it was , as i have seen it in his life , a sable silver .
i will watch , perchance walk again .
i warrant it will .
if it assume my noble father person , i speak to it , though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace .
i pray you all , if you have hitherto conceal this sight , let it be tenable in your silence still , and whatsoever else shall hap , give it an understanding , but no tongue i will requite your loves .
so , fare you well upon the platform , eleven and twelve , i visit you .
our duty to your honour .
your loves , as mine to you farewell .
exeunt all but hamlet my father spirit in arms !
all is not well , i doubt some foul play would the night were come !
till then sit still , my soul foul deeds will rise , though all the earth them , to men eyes .
exit scene iii .
a room in polonius ' house .
enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark farewell and , sister , as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant , do not sleep , but let me hear from you .
do you doubt that ?
for hamlet and the trifling of his favour , hold it a fashion and a toy in blood , a violet in the youth of primy nature , forward , not permanent , sweet , not lasting , the perfume and suppliance of a minute , no more .
no more but so ?
think it no more , for nature , crescent , does not grow alone in thews and bulk , but , as this temple waxes , the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal .
perhaps he loves you now , and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear , his greatness weigh , his will is not his own , for he himself is subject to his birth he may not , as unvalued persons do , carve for himself , for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state , and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head .
then if he says he loves you , it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed , which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal .
then weigh what loss your honour may sustain , if with too credent ear you list his songs , or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster importunity .
fear it , ophelia , fear it , my dear sister , and keep you in the rear of your affection , out of the shot and danger of desire .
the chariest maid is prodigal enough , if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring , too oft before their buttons be disclosed , and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent .
be wary then , best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels , though none else near .
i shall the effect of this good lesson keep , as watchman to my heart .
but , good my brother , do not , as some ungracious pastors do , show me the steep and thorny way to heaven , whiles , like a puff and reckless libertine , himself the primrose path of dalliance treads , and recks not his own rede .
o , fear me not .
i stay too long but here my father comes .
enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace , occasion smiles upon a second leave .
yet here , laertes !
aboard , aboard , for shame !
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail , and you are stay for .
there , my blessing with thee !
and these few precepts in thy memory see thou character .
give thy thoughts no tongue , nor any unproportioned thought his act .
be thou familiar , but by no means vulgar .
those friends thou hast , and their adoption tried , grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel , but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each , unfledged comrade .
beware of entrance to a quarrel , but being in , that the opposed may beware of thee .
give every man thy ear , but few thy voice , take each man censure , but reserve thy judgment .
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy , but not express in fancy , rich , not gaudy , for the apparel oft proclaims the man , and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that .
neither a borrower nor a lender be , for loan oft loses both itself and friend , and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry .
this above all to thine ownself be true , and it must follow , as the night the day , thou canst not then be false to any man .
farewell my blessing season this in thee !
most humbly do i take my leave , my lord .
the time invites you , go , your servants tend .
farewell , ophelia , and remember well what i have said to you .
is in my memory lock , and you yourself shall keep the key of it .
farewell .
exit what , ophelia , be hath said to you ?
so please you , something touching the lord hamlet .
marry , well bethought is told me , he hath very oft of late given private time to you , and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so , as so is put on me , and that in way of caution , i must tell you , you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour .
what is between you ?
give me up the truth .
he hath , my lord , of late made many tenders of his affection to me .
affection !
pooh !
you speak like a green girl , unsifted in such perilous circumstance .
do you believe his tenders , as you call them ?
i do not know , my lord , what i should think .
marry , i teach you think yourself a baby , that you have these tenders for true pay , which are not sterling .
tender yourself more dearly , or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase , running it thus you tender me a fool .
my lord , he hath importuned me with love in honourable fashion .
ay , fashion you may call it , go to , go to .
and hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , with almost all the holy vows of heaven .
ay , springes to catch woodcocks .
i do know , when the blood burns , how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes , daughter , giving more light than heat , extinct in both , even in their promise , as it is , you must not take for fire .
from this time be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence , set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley .
for lord hamlet , believe so much in him , that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few , ophelia , do not believe his vows , for they are brokers , not of that dye which their investments show , but mere implorators of unholy suits , breathing like sanctified and pious bawds , the better to beguile .
this is for all i would not , in plain terms , from this time forth , have you so slander any moment leisure , as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet .
look , i charge you come your ways .
i shall obey , my lord .
exeunt scene iv .
the platform .
enter hamlet , horatio , and marcellus the air bites shrewdly , it is very cold .
it is a nipping and an eager air .
what hour now ?
i think it lacks of twelve .
no , it is struck .
indeed ?
i heard it not then it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk .
a flourish of trumpets , and ordnance shot off , within what does this mean , my lord ?
the king doth wake and takes his rouse , keeps wassail , and the swaggering reels , and , as he drains his draughts of rhenish down , the and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge .
is it a custom ?
ay , marry , but to my mind , though i am native here and to the manner born , it is a custom more honour in the breach than the observance .
this revel east and west makes us traduced and tax of other nations they clepe us drunkards , and with swinish phrase soil our addition , and indeed it takes from our achievements , though perform at height , the pith and marrow of our attribute .
so , oft it chances in particular men , that for some vicious mole of nature in them , as , in their birth wherein they are not guilty , since nature can not choose his origin by the of some complexion , oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason , or by some habit that too much the form of plausive manners , that these men , carrying , i say , the stamp of one defect , being nature livery , or fortune star , their virtues else be they as pure as grace , as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of eale doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal .
look , my lord , it comes !
enter ghost angels and ministers of grace defend us !
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn , bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell , be thy intents wicked or charitable , thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee i call thee hamlet , king , father , royal dane o , answer me !
let me not burst in ignorance , but tell why thy canonized bones , hearsed in death , have burst their cerements , why the sepulchre , wherein we saw thee quietly inurn , hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws , to cast thee up again .
what may this mean , that thou , dead corse , again in complete steel thus the glimpses of the moon , making night hideous , and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls ?
say , why is this ?
wherefore ?
what should we do ?
ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it , as if it some impartment did desire to you alone .
look , with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it .
no , by no means .
it will not speak , then i will follow it .
do not , my lord .
why , what should be the fear ?
i do not set my life in a pin fee , and for my soul , what can it do to that , being a thing immortal as itself ?
it waves me forth again i follow it .
what if it tempt you toward the flood , my lord , or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles his base into the sea , and there assume some other horrible form , which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness ?
think of it the very place puts toys of desperation , without more motive , into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath .
it waves me still .
go on , i follow thee .
you shall not go , my lord .
hold off your hands .
be ruled , you shall not go .
my fate cries out , and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion nerve .
still am i call .
unhand me , gentlemen .
by heaven , i make a ghost of him that lets me !
i say , away !
go on , i follow thee .
exeunt ghost and hamlet he waxes desperate with imagination .
let follow , is not fit thus to obey him .
have after .
to what issue will this come ?
something is rotten in the state of denmark .
heaven will direct it .
nay , let follow him .
exeunt scene another part of the platform .
enter ghost and hamlet where wilt thou lead me ?
speak , i go no further .
mark me .
i will .
my hour is almost come , when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames must render up myself .
alas , poor ghost !
pity me not , but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold .
speak , i am bound to hear .
so art thou to revenge , when thou shalt hear .
what ?
i am thy father spirit , doom for a certain term to walk the night , and for the day confined to fast in fires , till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away .
but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my , i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul , freeze thy young blood , make thy two eyes , like stars , start from their spheres , thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end , like quills upon the fretful porpentine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood .
list , list , o , list !
if thou didst ever thy dear father love o god !
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
murder !
murder most foul , as in the best it is , but this most foul , strange and unnatural .
haste me to , that i , with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love , may sweep to my revenge .
i find thee apt , and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf , wouldst thou not stir in this .
now , hamlet , hear is given out that , sleeping in my orchard , a serpent stung me , so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abused but know , thou noble youth , the serpent that did sting thy father life now wears his crown .
o my prophetic soul !
my uncle !
ay , that incestuous , that adulterate beast , with witchcraft of his wit , with traitorous gifts , o wicked wit and gifts , that have the power so to seduce ! won to his shameful lust the will of my most queen o hamlet , what a was there !
from me , whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage , and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine !
but virtue , as it never will be moved , though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven , so lust , though to a radiant angel link , will sate itself in a celestial bed , and prey on garbage .
but , soft !
methinks i scent the morning air , brief let me be .
sleeping within my orchard , my custom always of the afternoon , upon my secure hour thy uncle stole , with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial , and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment , whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body , and with a sudden vigour doth posset and curd , like eager droppings into milk , the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine , and a most instant tetter bark about , most , with vile and loathsome crust , all my smooth body .
thus was i , sleeping , by a brother hand of life , of crown , of queen , at once dispatch cut off even in the blossoms of my sin , unhousel , disappointed , unanel , no reckoning made , but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o , horrible !
o , horrible !
most horrible !
if thou hast nature in thee , bear it not , let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest .
but , howsoever thou pursuest this act , taint not thy mind , nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge , to prick and sting her .
fare thee well at once !
the shows the matin to be near , and to pale his uneffectual fire adieu , adieu !
hamlet , remember me .
exit o all you host of heaven !
o earth !
what else ?
and shall i couple hell ?
o , fie !
hold , hold , my heart , and you , my sinews , grow not instant old , but bear me stiffly up .
remember thee !
ay , thou poor ghost , while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe .
remember thee !
yea , from the table of my memory i wipe away all trivial fond records , all saws of books , all forms , all pressures past , that youth and observation copied there , and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain , unmix with baser matter yes , by heaven !
o most pernicious woman !
o villain , villain , smiling , damned villain !
my tables , meet it is i set it down , that one may smile , and smile , and be a villain , at least i sure it may be so in denmark writing so , uncle , there you are .
now to my word , it is , adieu !
remember me . '
i have sworn .
within my lord , my lord , within lord hamlet , within heaven secure him !
so be it !
within hillo , ho , ho , my lord !
hillo , ho , ho , boy !
come , bird , come .
enter horatio and marcellus how , my noble lord ?
what news , my lord ?
o , wonderful !
good my lord , tell it .
no , you reveal it .
not i , my lord , by heaven .
nor i , my lord .
how say you , then , would heart of man once think it ?
but you be secret ?
ay , by heaven , my lord .
there a villain dwelling in all denmark but he an arrant knave .
there needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave to tell us this .
why , right , you are i ' the right , and so , without more circumstance at all , i hold it fit that we shake hands and part you , as your business and desire shall point you , for every man has business and desire , such as it is , and for mine own poor part , look you , i go pray .
these are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
i sorry they offend you , heartily , yes , heartily .
there no offence , my lord .
yes , by saint patrick , but there is , horatio , and much offence too .
touching this vision here , it is an honest ghost , that let me tell you for your desire to know what is between us , as you may .
and now , good friends , as you are friends , scholars and soldiers , give me one poor request .
what , my lord ?
we will .
never make known what you have seen .
my lord , we will not .
nay , but .
in faith , my lord , not i .
nor i , my lord , in faith .
upon my sword .
we have sworn , my lord , already .
indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
beneath swear .
ah , ha , boy !
thou so ?
art thou there , truepenny ?
come on you hear this fellow in the cellarage consent to swear .
propose the oath , my lord .
never to speak of this that you have seen , swear by my sword .
beneath swear .
hic et ubique ?
then we shift our ground .
come hither , gentlemen , and lay your hands again upon my sword never to speak of this that you have heard , swear by my sword .
beneath swear .
well said , old mole !
canst work i ' the earth so fast ?
a worthy pioner !
once more remove , good friends .
o day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome .
there are more things in heaven and earth , horatio , than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
but come , here , as before , never , so help you mercy , how strange or odd i bear myself , as i perchance hereafter shall think meet to put an antic disposition on , that you , at such times seeing me , never shall , with arms encumber thus , or this headshake , or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase , as , well , we know , ' or could , an if we would , ' or we list to speak , ' or be , an if they might , ' or such ambiguous giving out , to note that you know aught of me this not to do , so grace and mercy at your most need help you , swear .
beneath swear .
rest , rest , perturbed spirit !
they swear so , gentlemen , with all my love i do commend me to you and what so poor a man as hamlet is may do , to express his love and friending to you , god willing , shall not lack .
let us go in together , and still your fingers on your lips , i pray .
the time is out of joint o cursed spite , that ever i was born to set it right !
nay , come , let go together .
exeunt act ii scene i .
a room in polonius ' house .
enter polonius and reynaldo give him this money and these notes , reynaldo .
i will , my lord .
you shall do marvellous wisely , good reynaldo , before you visit him , to make inquire of his behavior .
my lord , i did intend it .
marry , well said , very well said .
look you , sir , inquire me first what danskers are in paris , and how , and who , what means , and where they keep , what company , at what expense , and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son , come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you , as , some distant knowledge of him , as thus , ' i know his father and his friends , and in part him ' do you mark this , reynaldo ?
ay , very well , my lord .
in part him , but ' you may say well but , be he i mean , he very wild , addicted so and so ' and there put on him what forgeries you please , marry , none so rank as may dishonour him , take heed of that , but , sir , such wanton , wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty .
as gaming , my lord .
ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , quarrelling , drabbing you may go so far .
my lord , that would dishonour him .
, no , as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him , that he is open to incontinency , that not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty , the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind , a savageness in unreclaimed blood , of general assault .
but , my good lord , wherefore should you do this ?
ay , my lord , i would know that .
marry , sir , here my drift , and i believe , it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son , as a thing a little soil i ' the working , mark you , your party in converse , him you would sound , having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty , be assured he closes with you in this consequence , sir , ' or so , or , ' or , ' according to the phrase or the addition of man and country .
very good , my lord .
and then , sir , does he this he does what was i about to say ?
by the mass , i was about to say something where did i leave ?
at in the consequence , ' at or so , ' and . '
at in the consequence , ' ay , marry , he closes thus ' i know the gentleman , i saw him yesterday , or t ' other day , or then , or then , with such , or such , and , as you say , there was a ' gaming , there in rouse , there falling out at tennis ' or perchance , ' i saw him enter such a house of sale , ' videlicet , a brothel , or so forth .
see you now , your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach , with windlasses and with assays of bias , by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice , shall you my son .
you have me , have you not ?
my lord , i have .
god be wi ' you , fare you well .
good my lord !
observe his inclination in yourself .
i shall , my lord .
and let him ply his music .
well , my lord .
farewell !
exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now , ophelia !
what the matter ?
o , my lord , my lord , i have been so affrighted !
with what , i ' the name of god ?
my lord , as i was sewing in my closet , lord hamlet , with his doublet all unbraced , no hat upon his head , his stockings foul , ungarter , and to his ancle , pale as his shirt , his knees knocking each other , and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors , he comes before me .
mad for thy love ?
my lord , i do not know , but truly , i do fear it .
what said he ?
he took me by the wrist and held me hard , then goes he to the length of all his arm , and , with his other hand thus his brow , he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it .
long stay he so , at last , a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down , he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done , he lets me go and , with his head over his shoulder turn , he seem to find his way without his eyes , for out o ' doors he went without their helps , and , to the last , bended their light on me .
come , go with me i will go seek the king .
this is the very ecstasy of love , whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures .
i am sorry .
what , have you given him any hard words of late ?
no , my good lord , but , as you did command , i did repel his fetters and denied his access to me .
that hath made him mad .
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear he did but trifle , and meant to wreck thee , but , beshrew my jealousy !
by heaven , it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion .
come , go we to the king this must be known , which , being kept close , might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love .
exeunt scene ii .
a room in the castle .
enter king claudius , queen gertrude , rosencrantz , guildenstern , and attendants welcome , dear rosencrantz and guildenstern !
moreover that we much did long to see you , the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending .
something have you heard of hamlet transformation , so call it , sith nor the exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was .
what it should be , more than his father death , that thus hath put him so much from the understanding of himself , i can not dream of i entreat you both , that , being of so young days brought up with him , and sith so neighbour to his youth and havior , that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures , and to gather , so much as from occasion you may glean , whether aught , to us unknown , afflicts him thus , that , open , lies within our remedy .
good gentlemen , he hath much talk of you , and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres .
if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile , for the supply and profit of our hope , your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king remembrance .
both your majesties might , by the sovereign power you have of us , put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty .
but we both obey , and here give up ourselves , in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet , to be commanded .
thanks , rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern .
thanks , guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son .
go , some of you , and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is .
heavens make our presence and our practises pleasant and helpful to him !
ay , amen !
exeunt rosencrantz , guildenstern , and some attendants enter polonius the ambassadors from norway , my good lord , are joyfully return .
thou still hast been the father of good news .
have i , my lord ?
i assure my good liege , i hold my duty , as i hold my soul , both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think , or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do , that i have found the very cause of hamlet lunacy .
o , speak of that , that do i long to hear .
give first admittance to the ambassadors , my news shall be the fruit to that great feast .
thyself do grace to them , and bring them in .
exit polonius he tells me , my dear gertrude , he hath found the head and source of all your son distemper .
i doubt it is no other but the main , his father death , and our marriage .
well , we shall sift him .
polonius , with voltimand and cornelius welcome , my good friends !
say , voltimand , what from our brother norway ?
most fair return of greetings and desires .
upon our first , he sent out to suppress his nephew levies , which to him appear to be a preparation the polack , but , better look into , he truly found it was against your highness whereat grieved , that so his sickness , age and impotence was falsely borne in hand , sends out arrests on fortinbras , which he , in brief , obeys , receives rebuke from norway , and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give the assay of arms against your majesty .
whereon old norway , overcome with joy , gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee , and his commission to employ those soldiers , so levied as before , against the polack with an entreaty , herein further shown , giving a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise , on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down .
it likes us well , and at our more consider time well read , answer , and think upon this business .
meantime we thank you for your labour go to your rest , at night we feast together most welcome home !
exeunt voltimand and cornelius this business is well ended .
my liege , and madam , to expostulate what majesty should be , what duty is , why day is day , night night , and time is time , were nothing but to waste night , day and time .
therefore , since brevity is the soul of wit , and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it , for , to define true madness , what but to be nothing else but mad ?
but let that go .
more matter , with less art .
madam , i swear i use no art at all .
that he is mad , is true is true is pity , and pity is is true a foolish figure , but farewell it , for i will use no art .
mad let us grant him , then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect , or rather say , the cause of this defect , for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains , and the remainder thus .
perpend .
i have a daughter have while she is mine who , in her duty and obedience , mark , hath given me this now gather , and surmise .
reads the celestial and my soul idol , the most beautified ophelia , ' that an ill phrase , a vile phrase , ' is a vile phrase but you shall hear .
thus reads her excellent white bosom , these , and ' came this from hamlet to her ?
good madam , stay awhile , i will be faithful .
reads thou the stars are fire , doubt that the sun doth move , doubt truth to be a liar , but never doubt i love .
' o dear ophelia , i am ill at these numbers , i have not art to reckon my groans but that i love thee best , o most best , believe it .
adieu .
evermore most dear lady , whilst this machine is to him , hamlet . '
this , in obedience , hath my daughter shown me , and more above , hath his solicitings , as they fell out by time , by means and place , all given to mine ear .
but how hath she received his love ?
what do you think of me ?
as of a man faithful and honourable .
i would fain prove so .
but what might you think , when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it , i must tell you that , before my daughter told me what might you , or my dear majesty your queen here , think , if i had play the desk or , or given my heart a winking , mute and dumb , or look upon this love with idle sight , what might you think ?
no , i went round to work , and my young mistress thus i did bespeak hamlet is a prince , out of thy star , this must not be ' and then i precepts gave her , that she should lock herself from his resort , admit no messengers , receive no tokens .
which done , she took the fruits of my advice , and he , repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness , then into a fast , thence to a watch , thence into a weakness , thence to a lightness , and , by this declension , into the madness wherein now he raves , and all we mourn for .
do you think is this ?
it may be , very likely .
hath there been such a time i fain know that that i have positively said is so , ' when it proved otherwise ?
not that i know .
pointing to his head and shoulder take this from this , if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me , i will find where truth is hid , though it were hid indeed within the centre .
how may we try it further ?
you know , sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby .
so he does indeed .
at such a time i loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then , mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason thereon , let me be no assistant for a state , but keep a farm and carters .
we will try it .
but , look , where sadly the poor wretch comes reading .
away , i do beseech you , both away i board him presently .
exeunt king claudius , queen gertrude , and attendants enter hamlet , reading o , give me leave how does my good lord hamlet ?
well , .
do you know me , my lord ?
excellent well , you are a fishmonger .
not i , my lord .
then i would you were so honest a man .
honest , my lord !
ay , sir , to be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
that very true , my lord .
for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a god kissing carrion , have you a daughter ?
i have , my lord .
let her not walk i ' the sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive .
friend , look to .
aside how say you by that ?
still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first , he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone , far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love , very near this .
i speak to him again .
what do you read , my lord ?
words , words , words .
what is the matter , my lord ?
between who ?
i mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
slanders , sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards , that their faces are wrinkled , their eyes purging thick amber and gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit , together with most weak hams all which , sir , though i most powerfully and potently believe , yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down , for yourself , sir , should be old as i am , if like a crab you could go backward .
aside though this be madness , yet there is method in .
will you walk out of the air , my lord ?
into my grave .
indeed , that is out o ' the air .
aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are !
a happiness that often madness hits on , which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of .
i will leave him , and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my my honourable lord , i will most humbly take my leave of you .
you can not , sir , take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal except my life , except my life , except my life .
fare you well , my lord .
these tedious old fools !
enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet , there he is .
to polonius god save you , sir !
exit polonius my honoured lord !
my most dear lord !
my excellent good friends !
how dost thou , guildenstern ?
ah , rosencrantz !
good lads , how do ye both ?
as the indifferent children of the earth .
happy , in that we are not , on fortune cap we are not the very button .
nor the soles of her shoe ?
neither , my lord .
then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favours ?
, her privates we .
in the secret parts of fortune ?
o , most true , she is a strumpet .
what the news ?
none , my lord , but that the world grown honest .
then is doomsday near but your news is not true .
let me question more in particular what have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune , that she sends you to prison hither ?
prison , my lord !
denmark a prison .
then is the world one .
a goodly one , in which there are many confines , wards and dungeons , denmark being one o ' the worst .
we think not so , my lord .
why , then , is none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison .
why then , your ambition makes it one , is too narrow for your mind .
o god , i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space , were it not that i have bad dreams .
which dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
a dream itself is but a shadow .
truly , and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow shadow .
then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows .
shall we to the court ?
for , by my fay , i can not reason .
we wait upon you .
no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants , for , to speak to you like an honest man , i am most dreadfully attended .
but , in the beaten way of friendship , what make you at elsinore ?
to visit you , my lord , no other occasion .
beggar that i am , i am even poor in thanks , but i thank you and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny .
were you not sent for ?
is it your own inclining ?
is it a free visitation ?
come , deal justly with me come , come , nay , speak .
what should we say , my lord ?
why , any thing , but to the purpose .
you were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you .
to what end , my lord ?
that you must teach me .
but let me conjure you , by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the obligation of our love , and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal , be even and direct with me , whether you were sent for , or no ?
aside to guildenstern what say you ?
aside nay , then , i have an eye of if you love me , hold not off .
my lord , we were sent for .
i will tell you why , so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery , and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather .
i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth , forgone all custom of exercises , and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame , the earth , seems to me a sterile promontory , this most excellent canopy , the air , look you , this brave firmament , this majestical roof fretted with golden fire , why , it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours .
what a piece of work is a man !
how noble in reason !
how infinite in faculty !
in form and moving how express and admirable !
in action how like an angel !
in apprehension how like a god !
the beauty of the world !
the paragon of animals !
and yet , to me , what is this quintessence of dust ?
man delights not me no , nor woman neither , though by your smiling you seem to say so .
my lord , there was no such stuff in my thoughts .
why did you laugh then , when i said delights not me ' ?
to think , my lord , if you delight not in man , what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way , and hither are they coming , to offer you service .
he that plays the king shall be welcome , his majesty shall have tribute of me , the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target , the lover shall not sigh gratis , the humourous man shall end his part in peace , the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o ' the sere , and the lady shall say her mind freely , or the blank verse shall halt .
what players are they ?
even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
how chances it they travel ?
their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city ?
are they so followed ?
no , indeed , are they not .
how comes it ?
do they grow rusty ?
nay , their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is , sir , an aery of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question , and are most tyrannically clapped these are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of and dare scarce come thither .
what , are they children ?
who maintains ?
how are they escoted ?
will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ?
will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like , if their means are no better their writers do them wrong , to make them exclaim against their own succession ?
, there has been much to do on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was , for a while , no money bid for argument , unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question .
possible ?
o , there has been much throwing about of brains .
do the boys carry it away ?
ay , that they do , my lord , hercules and his load too .
it is not very strange , for mine uncle is king of denmark , and those that would make mows at him while my father lived , give twenty , forty , fifty , an hundred ducats for his picture in little .
, there is something in this more than natural , if philosophy could find it out .
flourish of trumpets within there are the players .
gentlemen , you are welcome to elsinore .
your hands , come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players , which , i tell you , must show fairly outward , should more appear like entertainment than yours .
you are welcome but my and are deceived .
in what , my dear lord ?
i am but mad when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw .
enter polonius well be with you , gentlemen !
hark you , guildenstern , and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his .
happily he the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players , mark it .
you say right , sir o ' monday morning , was so indeed .
my lord , i have news to tell you .
my lord , i have news to tell you .
when roscius was an actor in rome , the actors are come hither , my lord .
buz , buz !
upon mine honour , then came each actor on his ass , the best actors in the world , either for tragedy , comedy , history , pastoral , , , , , scene individable , or poem unlimited seneca can not be too heavy , nor plautus too light .
for the law of writ and the liberty , these are the only men .
o jephthah , judge of israel , what a treasure hadst thou !
what a treasure had he , my lord ?
why , fair daughter and no more , the which he loved passing well . '
aside still on my daughter .
am i not i ' the right , old jephthah ?
if you call me jephthah , my lord , i have a daughter that i love passing well .
nay , that follows not .
what follows , then , my lord ?
why , by lot , god wot , ' and then , you know , came to pass , as most like it was , ' the first row of the pious chanson will show you more , for look , where my abridgement comes .
enter four or five players you are welcome , masters , welcome , all .
i am glad to see thee well .
welcome , good friends .
o , my old friend !
thy face is valenced since i saw thee last comest thou to beard me in denmark ?
what , my young lady and mistress !
by ' r lady , your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last , by the altitude of a chopine .
pray god , your voice , like apiece of uncurrent gold , be not cracked within the ring .
masters , you are all welcome .
we like french falconers , fly at any thing we see we have a speech straight come , give us a taste of your quality , come , a passionate speech .
what speech , my lord ?
i heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was never acted , or , if it was , not above once , for the play , i remember , pleased not the million , was caviare to the general but it was as i received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as cunning .
i remember , one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury , nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation , but called it an honest method , as wholesome as sweet , and by very much more handsome than fine .
one speech in it i chiefly loved was aeneas ' tale to dido , and thereabout of it especially , where he speaks of priam slaughter if it live in your memory , begin at this line let me see , let me see rugged pyrrhus , like the hyrcanian beast , ' it is not so it begins with pyrrhus rugged pyrrhus , he whose sable arms , black as his purpose , did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse , hath now this dread and black complexion smear with heraldry more dismal , head to foot now is he total gules , horridly trick with blood of fathers , mothers , daughters , sons , baked and impasted with the parching streets , that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lord murder roasted in wrath and fire , and thus with coagulate gore , with eyes like carbuncles , the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks . '
so , proceed you .
god , my lord , well spoken , with good accent and good discretion .
he finds him striking too short at greeks , his antique sword , rebellious to his arm , lies where it falls , repugnant to command unequal match , pyrrhus at priam drives , in rage strikes wide , but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls .
then senseless ilium , seeming to feel this blow , with flaming top stoops to his base , and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ' ear for , lo !
his sword , which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam , seem i ' the air to stick so , as a painted tyrant , pyrrhus stood , and like a neutral to his will and matter , did nothing .
but , as we often see , against some storm , a silence in the heavens , the rack stand still , the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death , anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region , so , after pyrrhus ' pause , aroused vengeance sets him new , and never did the cyclops ' hammers fall on mars armour forged for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus ' bleeding sword now falls on priam .
out , out , thou strumpet , fortune !
all you gods , in general synod away her power , break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel , and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven , as low as to the fiends ! '
this is too long .
it shall to the barber , with your beard .
prithee , say on he for a jig or a tale of bawdry , or he sleeps say on come to hecuba .
who , o , who had seen the mobled queen ' mobled queen ? '
that good , queen ' is good .
barefoot up and down , threatening the flames with bisson rheum , a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood , and for a robe , about her lank and all loins , a blanket , in the alarm of fear caught up , who this had seen , with tongue in venom steep , fortune state would treason have pronounced but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband limbs , the instant burst of clamour that she made , unless things mortal move them not at all , would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven , and passion in the gods . '
look , whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in eyes .
pray you , no more .
is well i have thee speak out the rest soon .
good my lord , will you see the players well bestowed ?
do you hear , let them be well used , for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live .
my lord , i will use them according to their desert .
god bodykins , man , much better use every man after his desert , and who should whipping ?
use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .
take them in .
come , sirs .
follow him , friends we hear a play .
exit polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me , old friend , can you play the murder of gonzago ?
ay , my lord .
we night .
you could , for a need , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines , which i would set down and insert i , could you not ?
ay , my lord .
very well .
follow that lord , and look you mock him not .
exit first player my good friends , i leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore .
good my lord !
ay , so , god be wi ' ye , exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern now i am alone .
o , what a rogue and peasant slave am i !
is it not monstrous that this player here , but in a fiction , in a dream of passion , could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wann , tears in his eyes , distraction in aspect , a broken voice , and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit ?
and all for nothing !
for hecuba !
what hecuba to him , or he to hecuba , that he should weep for her ?
what would he do , had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have ?
he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech , make mad the guilty and appal the free , confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears .
yet i , a dull and rascal , peak , like , unpregnant of my cause , and can say nothing , no , not for a king , upon whose property and most dear life a damn defeat was made .
am i a coward ?
who calls me villain ?
breaks my pate across ?
plucks off my beard , and blows it in my face ?
tweaks me by the nose ?
gives me the lie i ' the throat , as deep as to the lungs ?
who does me this ?
ha !
, i should take it for it can not be but i am and lack gall to make oppression bitter , or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave offal bloody , bawdy villain !
remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
o , vengeance !
why , what an ass am i !
this is most brave , that i , the son of a dear father murder , prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell , must , like a whore , unpack my heart with words , and fall , like a very drab , a scullion !
fie upo !
foh !
about , my brain !
i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim their malefactions , for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .
i have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i observe his looks , i tent him to the quick if he but blench , i know my course .
the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape , yea , and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy , as he is very potent with such spirits , abuses me to damn me i have grounds more relative than this the play the thing wherein i catch the conscience of the king .
exit act iii scene i .
a room in the castle .
enter king claudius , queen gertrude , polonius , ophelia , rosencrantz , and guildenstern and can you , by no drift of circumstance , get from him why he puts on this confusion , grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
he does confess he feels himself distracted , but from what cause he will by no means speak .
nor do we find him forward to be sounded , but , with a crafty madness , keeps aloof , when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state .
did he receive you well ?
most like a gentleman .
but with much forcing of his disposition .
niggard of question , but , of our demands , most free in his reply .
did you assay him ?
to any pastime ?
madam , it so fell out , that certain players we on the way of these we told him , and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court , and , as i think , they have already order this night to play before him .
is most true and he beseech me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter .
with all my heart , and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined .
good gentlemen , give him a further edge , and drive his purpose on to these delights .
we shall , my lord .
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude , leave us too , for we have closely sent for hamlet hither , that he , as by accident , may here affront ophelia her father and myself , lawful espials , will so bestow ourselves that , seeing , unseen , we may of their encounter frankly judge , and gather by him , as he is behaved , if be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for .
i shall obey you .
and for your part , ophelia , i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again , to both your honours .
madam , i wish it may .
exit queen gertrude ophelia , walk you here .
gracious , so please you , we will bestow ourselves .
to ophelia read on this book , that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness .
we are oft to blame in this , is too much proved that with devotion visage and pious action we do sugar the devil himself .
aside o , is too true !
how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience !
the harlot cheek , beautied with plastering art , is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burthen !
i hear him coming let withdraw , my lord .
exeunt king claudius and polonius enter hamlet to be , or not to be that is the question whether is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , or to take arms against a sea of troubles , and by opposing end them ?
to die to sleep , no more , and by a sleep to say we end the and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to , is a consummation devoutly to be wish .
to die , to sleep , to sleep perchance to dream ay , there the rub , for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil , must give us pause there the respect that makes calamity of so long life , for who would bear the whips and scorns of time , the oppressor wrong , the proud man contumely , the pangs of despised love , the law delay , the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes , when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin ?
who would fardels bear , to grunt and sweat under a weary life , but that the dread of something after death , the undiscover country from whose bourn no traveller returns , puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of ?
thus conscience does make cowards of us all , and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied with the pale cast of thought , and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry , and lose the name of soft you now !
the fair ophelia !
nymph , in thy orisons be all my sins remember .
good my lord , how does your honour for this many a day ?
i humbly thank you , well , well , well .
my lord , i have remembrances of yours , that i have longed long to , i pray you , now receive them .
no , not i , i never gave you aught .
my honour lord , you know right well you did , and , with them , words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich their perfume lost , take these again , for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind .
there , my lord .
ha , ha !
are you honest ?
my lord ?
are you fair ?
what means your lordship ?
that if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
ay , truly , for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof .
i did love you once .
indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
you should not have believed me , for virtue can not so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not .
i was the more deceived .
get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ?
i am myself indifferent honest , but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in .
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven ?
we are arrant knaves , all , believe none of us .
go thy ways to a nunnery .
where your father ?
at home , my lord .
let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no where but in own house .
farewell .
o , help him , you sweet heavens !
if thou dost marry , i give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice , as pure as snow , thou shalt not escape calumny .
get thee to a nunnery , go farewell .
or , if thou wilt needs marry , marry a fool , for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them .
to a nunnery , go , and quickly too .
farewell .
o heavenly powers , restore him !
i have heard of your paintings too , well enough , god has given you one face , and you make yourselves another you jig , you amble , and you lisp , and god creatures , and make your wantonness your ignorance .
go to , i no more o , it hath made me mad .
i say , we will have no more marriages those that are married already , all but one , shall live , the rest shall keep as they are .
to a nunnery , go .
exit o , what a noble mind is here !
the courtier , soldier , scholar , eye , tongue , sword , the expectancy and rose of the fair state , the glass of fashion and the mould of form , the observed of all observers , quite , quite down !
and i , of ladies most deject and wretched , that suck the honey of his music vows , now see that noble and most sovereign reason , like sweet bells jangled , out of tune and harsh , that unmatch form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o , woe is me , to have seen what i have seen , see what i see !
king claudius and polonius love !
his affections do not that way tend , nor what he spake , though it lack form a little , was not like madness .
there something in his soul , which his melancholy sits on brood , and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent , i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england , for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this matter in his heart , whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself .
what think you o ?
it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love .
how now , ophelia !
you need not tell us what lord hamlet said , we heard it all .
my lord , do as you please , but , if you hold it fit , after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him , and i be placed , so please you , in the ear of all their conference .
if she find him not , to england send him , or confine him where your wisdom best shall think .
it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatch go .
exeunt scene ii .
a hall in the castle .
enter hamlet and players speak the speech , i pray you , as i pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it , as many of your players do , i had as lief the spoke my lines .
nor do not saw the air too much with your hand , thus , but use all gently , for in the very torrent , tempest , and , as i may say , the whirlwind of passion , you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness .
o , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for termagant , it herod pray you , avoid it .
i warrant your honour .
be not too tame neither , but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word , the word to the action , with this special not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing , whose end , both at the first and now , was and is , to hold , as , the mirror up to nature , to show virtue her own feature , scorn her own image , and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure .
now this overdone , or come tardy off , though it make the unskilful laugh , can not but make the judicious grieve , the censure of the which one must in your allowance a whole theatre of others .
o , there be players that i have seen play , and heard others praise , and that highly , not to speak it profanely , that , neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian , pagan , nor man , have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature journeymen had made men and not made them well , they imitated humanity so abominably .
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .
o , reform it altogether .
and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh , to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though , in the mean time , some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that villanous , and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it .
go , make you ready .
exeunt players enter polonius , rosencrantz , and guildenstern how now , my lord !
i will the king hear this piece of work ?
and the queen too , and that presently .
bid the players make haste .
exit polonius will you two help to hasten them ?
we will , my lord .
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern what ho !
horatio !
enter horatio here , sweet lord , at your service .
horatio , thou art as just a man as my conversation coped withal .
o , my dear lord , nay , do not think i flatter , for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits , to feed and clothe thee ?
why should the poor be flatter ?
no , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning .
dost thou hear ?
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish , her election hath seal thee for herself , for thou hast been as one , in suffering all , that suffers nothing , a man that fortune buffets and rewards hast with equal thanks and blest are those whose blood and judgment are so well commingled , that they are not a pipe for fortune finger to sound what stop she please .
give me that man that is not passion slave , and i will wear him in my heart core , ay , in my heart of heart , as i do something too much of there is a play before the king , one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father death i prithee , when thou seest that act afoot , even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech , it is a damned ghost that we have seen , and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan stithy .
give him heedful note , for i mine eyes will rivet to his face , and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming .
well , my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing , and detecting , i will pay the theft .
they are coming to the play , i must be idle get you a place .
danish march .
a flourish .
enter king claudius , queen gertrude , polonius , ophelia , rosencrantz , guildenstern , and others how fares our cousin hamlet ?
excellent , i ' faith , of the chameleon dish i eat the air , you can not feed capons so .
i have nothing with this answer , hamlet , these words are not mine .
no , nor mine now .
to polonius my lord , you played once i ' the university , you say ?
that did i , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
what did you enact ?
i did enact julius caesar i was killed i ' the capitol , brutus killed me .
it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there .
be the players ready ?
ay , my lord , they stay upon your patience .
come hither , my dear hamlet , sit by me .
no , good mother , here metal more attractive .
to king claudius o , ho !
do you mark that ?
lady , shall i lie in your lap ?
lying down at ophelia feet no , my lord .
i mean , my head upon your lap ?
ay , my lord .
do you think i meant country matters ?
i think nothing , my lord .
that a fair thought to lie between maids ' legs .
what is , my lord ?
nothing .
you are merry , my lord .
who , i ?
ay , my lord .
o god , your only .
what should a man do but be merry ?
for , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
nay , is twice two months , my lord .
so long ?
nay then , let the devil wear black , for i have a suit of sables .
o heavens !
die two months ago , and not forgotten yet ?
then there hope a great man memory may outlive his life half a year but , by ' r lady , he must build churches , then , or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the , whose epitaph is , o , for , o , the is forgot . '
hautboys play .
the enters enter a king and a queen very lovingly , the queen embracing him , and he her .
she kneels , and makes show of protestation unto him .
he takes her up , and declines his head upon her neck lays him down upon a bank of flowers she , seeing him asleep , leaves him .
anon comes in a fellow , takes off his crown , kisses it , and pours poison in the king ears , and exit .
the queen returns , finds the king dead , and makes passionate action .
the poisoner , with some two or three mutes , comes in again , seeming to lament with her .
the dead body is carried away .
the poisoner wooes the queen with gifts she seems loath and unwilling awhile , but in the end accepts his love exeunt what means this , my lord ?
marry , this is miching mallecho , it means mischief .
belike this show imports the argument of the play .
enter prologue we shall know by this fellow the players can not keep counsel , they tell all .
will he tell us what this show meant ?
ay , or any show that you show him be not you ashamed to show , he not shame to tell you what it means .
you are naught , you are naught i mark the play .
for us , and for our tragedy , here stooping to your clemency , we beg your hearing patiently .
exit is this a prologue , or the posy of a ring ?
is brief , my lord .
as woman love .
enter two players , king and queen full thirty times hath phoebus ' cart gone round neptune salt wash and tellus ' orbed ground , and thirty dozen moons with borrow sheen about the world have times twelve thirties been , since love our hearts and hymen did our hands unite commutual in most sacred bands .
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count ere love be done !
but , woe is me , you are so sick of late , so far from cheer and from your former state , that i distrust you .
yet , though i distrust , discomfort you , my lord , it nothing must for women fear and love holds quantity , in neither aught , or in extremity .
now , what my love is , proof hath made you know , and as my love is sized , my fear is so where love is great , the littlest doubts are fear , where little fears grow great , great love grows there .
, i must leave thee , love , and shortly too , my operant powers their functions leave to do and thou shalt live in this fair world behind , honour , beloved , and haply one as kind for husband shalt thou o , confound the rest !
such love must needs be treason in my breast in second husband let me be accurst !
none wed the second but who kill the first .
aside wormwood , wormwood .
the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift , but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead , when second husband kisses me in bed .
i do believe you think what now you speak , but what we do determine oft we break .
purpose is but the slave to memory , of violent birth , but poor validity , which now , like fruit unripe , sticks on the tree , but fall , unshaken , when they mellow be .
most necessary is that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose , the passion ending , doth the purpose lose .
the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels , grief doth most lament , grief joys , joy grieves , on slender accident .
this world is not for aye , nor is not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change , for is a question left us yet to prove , whether love lead fortune , or else fortune love .
the great man down , you mark his favourite flies , the poor advanced makes friends of enemies .
and hitherto doth love on fortune tend , for who not needs shall never lack a friend , and who in want a hollow friend doth try , directly seasons him his enemy .
but , orderly to end where i begun , our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown , our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our own so think thou wilt no second husband wed , but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead .
nor earth to me give food , nor heaven light !
sport and repose lock from me day and night !
to desperation turn my trust and hope !
an anchor cheer in prison be my scope !
each opposite that blanks the face of joy meet what i would have well and it destroy !
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife , if , once a widow , ever i be wife !
if she should break it now !
is deeply sworn .
sweet , leave me here awhile , my spirits grow dull , and fain i would beguile the tedious day with sleep .
sleeps sleep rock thy brain , and never come mischance between us twain !
exit madam , how like you this play ?
the lady protests too much , methinks .
o , but she keep her word .
have you heard the argument ?
is there no offence in ?
no , no , they do but jest , poison in jest , no offence i ' the world .
what do you call the play ?
the .
marry , how ?
tropically .
this play is the image of a murder done in vienna gonzago is the duke name , his wife , baptista you shall see anon , is a knavish piece of work but what o ' that ?
your majesty and we that have free souls , it touches us not let the galled jade wince , our withers are unwrung .
enter lucianus this is one lucianus , nephew to the king .
you are as good as a chorus , my lord .
i could interpret between you and your love , if i could see the puppets dallying .
you are keen , my lord , you are keen .
it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge .
still better , and worse .
so you must take your husbands .
begin , murderer , pox , leave thy damnable faces , and begin .
come croaking raven doth bellow for revenge . '
thoughts black , hands apt , drugs fit , and time agreeing , confederate season , else no creature seeing , thou mixture rank , of midnight weeds collected , with hecate ban thrice blasted , thrice infected , thy natural magic and dire property , on wholesome life usurp immediately .
pours the poison into the sleeper ears he poisons him i ' the garden for estate .
his name gonzago the story is extant , and writ in choice italian you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago wife .
the king rises .
what , frighted with false fire !
how fares my lord ?
give the play .
give me some light away !
lights , lights , lights !
exeunt all but hamlet and horatio why , let the stricken deer go weep , the hart ungalled play , for some must watch , while some must sleep so runs the world away .
would not this , sir , and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me with two provincial roses on my razed shoes , get me a fellowship in a cry of players , sir ?
half a share .
a whole one , i .
for thou dost know , o damon dear , this realm dismantled was of jove himself , and now reigns here a very , very pajock .
you might have rhymed .
o good horatio , i take the ghost word for a thousand pound .
didst perceive ?
very well , my lord .
upon the talk of the poisoning ?
i did very well note him .
ah , ha !
come , some music !
come , the recorders !
for if the king like not the comedy , why then , belike , he likes it not , perdy .
come , some music !
rosencrantz and guildenstern good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
sir , a whole history .
the king , sir , ay , sir , what of him ?
is in his retirement marvellous distempered .
with drink , sir ?
no , my lord , rather with choler .
your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor , for , for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler .
good my lord , put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair .
i am tame , sir pronounce .
the queen , your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
you are welcome .
nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed .
if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer , i will do your mother commandment if not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
sir , i can not .
what , my lord ?
make you a wholesome answer , my wit diseased but , sir , such answer as i can make , you shall command , or , rather , as you say , my mother therefore no more , but to the matter my mother , you say , then thus she says , your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration .
o wonderful son , that can so astonish a mother !
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother admiration ?
impart .
she desires to speak with you in her closet , ere you go to bed .
we shall obey , were she ten times our mother .
have you any further trade with us ?
my lord , you once did love me .
so i do still , by these pickers and stealers .
good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ?
you do , surely , bar the door upon your own liberty , if you deny your griefs to your friend .
sir , i lack advancement .
how can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark ?
ay , but sir , the grass grows , ' the proverb is something musty .
players with recorders o , the recorders !
let me see one .
to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me , as if you would drive me into a toil ?
o , my lord , if my duty be too bold , my love is too unmannerly .
i do not well understand that .
will you play upon this pipe ?
my lord , i can not .
i pray you .
believe me , i can not .
i do beseech you .
i know no touch of it , my lord .
is as easy as lying govern these ventages with your lingers and thumb , give it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most eloquent music .
look you , these are the stops .
but these can not i command to any utterance of harmony , i have not the skill .
why , look you now , how unworthy a thing you make of me !
you would play upon me , you would seem to know my stops , you would pluck out the heart of my mystery , you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music , excellent voice , in this little organ , yet can not you make it speak .
, do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , yet you can not play upon me .
enter polonius god bless you , sir !
my lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently .
do you see yonder cloud that almost in shape of a camel ?
by the mass , and is like a camel , indeed .
methinks it is like a weasel .
it is backed like a weasel .
or like a whale ?
very like a whale .
then i will come to my mother by and by .
they fool me to the top of my bent .
i will come by and by .
i will say so .
by and by is easily said .
exit polonius leave me , friends .
exeunt all but hamlet tis now the very witching time of night , when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood , and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on .
soft !
now to my mother .
o heart , lose not thy nature , let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel , not unnatural i will speak daggers to her , but use none , my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites , how in my words soever she be shent , to give them seals never , my soul , consent !
exit scene iii .
a room in the castle .
enter king claudius , rosencrantz , and guildenstern i like him not , nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range .
therefore prepare you , i your commission will forthwith dispatch , and he to england shall along with you the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies .
we will ourselves provide most holy and religious fear it is to keep those many many bodies safe that live and feed upon your majesty .
the single and peculiar life is bound , with all the strength and armour of the mind , to keep itself from noyance , but much more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives of many .
the cease of majesty dies not alone , but , like a gulf , doth draw what near it with it it is a massy wheel , fix on the summit of the highest mount , to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortised and adjoin , which , when it falls , each small annexment , petty consequence , attends the boisterous ruin .
never alone did the king sigh , but with a general groan .
arm you , i pray you , to this speedy voyage , for we will fetters put upon this fear , which now goes too .
we will haste us .
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern enter polonius my lord , he going to his mother closet behind the arras i convey myself , to hear the process , and warrant she tax him home and , as you said , and wisely was it said , is meet that some more audience than a mother , since nature makes them partial , should the speech , of vantage .
fare you well , my liege i call upon you ere you go to bed , and tell you what i know .
thanks , dear my lord .
exit polonius o , my offence is rank it smells to heaven , it hath the primal eldest curse upo , a brother murder .
pray can i not , though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent , and , like a man to double business bound , i stand in pause where i shall first begin , and both neglect .
what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brother blood , is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow ?
whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence ?
and what in prayer but this force , to be forestalled ere we come to fall , or pardon being down ?
then i look up , my fault is past .
but , o , what form of prayer can serve my turn ?
me my foul murder ' ?
that can not be , since i am still possess of those effects for which i did the murder , my crown , mine own ambition and my queen .
may one be pardon and retain the offence ?
in the corrupted currents of this world offence gilded hand may shove by justice , and oft is seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but is not so above , there is no shuffling , there the action lies in his true nature , and we ourselves compell , even to the teeth and forehead of our faults , to give in evidence .
what then ?
what rests ?
try what repentance can what can it not ?
yet what can it when one can not repent ?
o wretched state !
o bosom black as death !
o limed soul , that , struggling to be free , art more engaged !
help , angels !
make assay !
bow , stubborn knees , and , heart with strings of steel , be soft as sinews of the newborn babe !
all may be well .
retires and kneels enter hamlet now might i do it pat , now he is praying , and now i .
and so he goes to heaven , and so am i revenged .
that would be scann a villain kills my father , and for that , i , his sole son , do this same villain send to heaven .
o , this is hire and salary , not revenge .
he took my father grossly , full of bread , with all his crimes broad blown , as flush as may , and how his audit stands who knows save heaven ?
but in our circumstance and course of thought , is heavy with him and am i then revenged , to take him in the purging of his soul , when he is fit and season for his passage ?
no !
up , sword , and know thou a more horrid hent when he is drunk asleep , or in his rage , or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed , at gaming , swearing , or about some act that has no relish of salvation i , then trip him , that his heels may kick at heaven , and that his soul may be as damn and black as hell , whereto it goes .
my mother stays this physic but prolongs thy sickly days .
exit rising my words fly up , my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go .
exit scene iv .
the queen closet .
enter queen gertrude and polonius he will come straight .
look you lay home to him tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with , and that your grace hath screen and stood between much heat and him .
i sconce me even here .
pray you , be round with him .
within mother , mother , mother !
i warrant you , fear me not withdraw , i hear him coming .
polonius hides behind the arras enter hamlet now , mother , what the matter ?
hamlet , thou hast thy father much offended .
mother , you have my father much offended .
come , come , you answer with an idle tongue .
go , go , you question with a wicked tongue .
why , how now , hamlet !
what the matter now ?
have you forgot me ?
no , by the rood , not so you are the queen , your husband brother wife , and would it were not so ! you are my mother .
nay , then , i set those to you that can speak .
come , come , and sit you down , you shall not budge , you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you .
what wilt thou do ?
thou wilt not murder me ?
help , help , ho !
behind what , ho !
help , help , help !
drawing how now !
a rat ?
dead , for a ducat , dead !
makes a pass through the arras behind o , i am slain !
falls and dies o me , what hast thou done ?
nay , i know not is it the king ?
o , what a rash and bloody deed is this !
a bloody deed !
almost as bad , good mother , as kill a king , and marry with his brother .
as kill a king !
ay , lady , was my word .
lifts up the array and discovers polonius thou wretched , rash , intruding fool , farewell !
i took thee for thy better take thy fortune , thou to be too busy is some danger .
leave wringing of your hands peace !
sit you down , and let me wring your heart , for so i shall , if it be made of penetrable stuff , if damned custom have not brass it so that it is proof and bulwark against sense .
what have i done , that thou darest wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me ?
such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty , calls virtue hypocrite , takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there , makes as false as dicers ' oaths o , such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul , and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words heaven face doth glow yea , this solidity and compound mass , with tristful visage , as against the doom , is at the act .
ay me , what act , that roars so loud , and thunders in the index ?
look here , upon this picture , and on this , the counterfeit presentment of two brothers .
see , what a grace was seated on this brow , hyperion curls , the front of jove himself , an eye like mars , to threaten and command , a station like the herald mercury on a hill , a combination and a form indeed , where every god did seem to set his seal , to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband .
look you now , what follows here is your husband , like a mildew ear , blasting his wholesome brother .
have you eyes ?
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed , and batten on this moor ?
ha !
have you eyes ?
you can not call it love , for at your age the in the blood is tame , it humble , and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this ?
sense , sure , you have , else could you not have motion , but sure , that sense is apoplex , for madness would not err , nor sense to ecstasy was so thrall but it reserved some quantity of choice , to serve in such a difference .
what devil that thus hath cozen you at ?
eyes without feeling , feeling without sight , ears without hands or eyes , smelling sans all , or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope .
o shame !
where is thy blush ?
rebellious hell , if thou canst mutine in a matron bones , to flaming youth let virtue be as wax , and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge , since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will .
o hamlet , speak no more thou mine eyes into my very soul , and there i see such black and grained spots as will not leave their tinct .
nay , but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed , stew in corruption , honeying and making love over the nasty sty , o , speak to me no more , these words , like daggers , enter in mine ears , no more , sweet hamlet !
a murderer and a villain , a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord , a vice of kings , a cutpurse of the empire and the rule , that from a shelf the precious diadem stole , and put it in his pocket !
no more !
a king of shreds and patches , enter ghost save me , and hover me with your wings , you heavenly guards !
what would your gracious figure ?
alas , he mad !
do you not come your tardy son to chide , that , lapsed in time and passion , lets go by the important acting of your dread command ?
o , say !
do not forget this visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose .
but , look , amazement on thy mother sits o , step between her and her fighting soul conceit in weakest bodies strongest works speak to her , hamlet .
how is it with you , lady ?
alas , how with you , that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with the incorporal air do hold discourse ?
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep , and , as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm , your bedded hair , like life in excrements , starts up , and stands on end .
o gentle son , upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience .
whereon do you look ?
on him , on him !
look you , how pale he glares !
his form and cause conjoin , preaching to stones , would make them capable .
do not look upon me , lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects then what i have to do will want true colour , tears perchance for blood .
to whom do you speak this ?
do you see nothing there ?
nothing at all , yet all that is i see .
nor did you nothing hear ?
no , nothing but ourselves .
why , look you there !
look , how it steals away !
my father , in his habit as he lived !
look , where he goes , even now , out at the portal !
exit ghost this the very coinage of your brain this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in .
ecstasy !
my pulse , as yours , doth temperately keep time , and makes as healthful music it is not madness that i have utter bring me to the test , and i the matter will , which madness would gambol from .
mother , for love of grace , lay not that mattering unction to your soul , that not your trespass , but my madness speaks it will but skin and film the ulcerous place , whilst rank corruption , mining all within , infects unseen .
confess yourself to heaven , repent what past , avoid what is to come , and do not spread the compost on the weeds , to make them ranker .
forgive me this my virtue , for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg , yea , curb and woo for leave to do him good .
o hamlet , thou hast cleft my heart in twain .
o , throw away the worser part of it , and live the purer with the other half .
good night but go not to mine uncle bed , assume a virtue , if you have it not .
that monster , custom , who all sense doth eat , of habits devil , is angel yet in this , that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery , that aptly is put on .
refrain , and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence the next more easy , for use almost can change the stamp of nature , and either the devil , or throw him out with wondrous potency .
once more , good night and when you are desirous to be bless , i blessing beg of you .
for this same lord , pointing to polonius i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so , to punish me with this and this with me , that i must be their scourge and minister .
i will bestow him , and will answer well the death i gave him .
so , again , good night .
i must be cruel , only to be kind thus bad begins and worse remains behind .
one word more , good lady .
what shall i do ?
not this , by no means , that i bid you do let the bloat king tempt you again to bed , pinch wanton on your cheek , call you his mouse , and let him , for a pair of reechy kisses , or paddling in your neck with his damn fingers , make you to ravel all this matter out , that i essentially am not in madness , but mad in craft .
good you let him know , for who , that but a queen , fair , sober , wise , would from a paddock , from a bat , a gib , such dear concernings hide ?
who would do so ?
no , in despite of sense and secrecy , unpeg the basket on the house top .
let the birds fly , and , like the famous ape , to try conclusions , in the basket creep , and break your own neck down .
be thou assured , if words be made of breath , and breath of life , i have no life to breathe what thou hast said to me .
i must to england , you know that ?
alack , i had forgot is so concluded on .
there letters seal and my two schoolfellows , whom i will trust as i will adders fang , they bear the mandate , they must sweep my way , and marshal me to knavery .
let it work , for is the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard and shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines , and blow them at the moon o , is most sweet , when in one line two crafts directly meet .
this man shall set me packing i lug the guts into the neighbour room .
mother , good night .
indeed this counsellor is now most still , most secret and most grave , who was in life a foolish prating knave .
come , sir , to draw toward an end with you .
good night , mother .
exeunt severally , hamlet dragging in polonius act iv scene i .
a room in the castle .
enter king claudius , queen gertrude , rosencrantz , and guildenstern there matter in these sighs , these profound heaves you must translate is fit we understand them .
where is your son ?
bestow this place on us a little while .
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern ah , my good lord , what have i seen !
what , gertrude ?
how does hamlet ?
mad as the sea and wind , when both contend which is the mightier in his lawless fit , behind the arras hearing something stir , whips out his rapier , cries , ' a rat , a rat ! '
and , in this brainish apprehension , kills the unseen good old man .
o heavy deed !
it had been so with us , had we been there his liberty is full of threats to all , to you yourself , to us , to every one .
alas , how shall this bloody deed be answer ?
it will be laid to us , whose providence should have kept short , restrain and out of haunt , this mad young man but so much was our love , we would not understand what was most fit , but , like the owner of a foul disease , to keep it from divulging , let it feed even on the pith of life .
where is he gone ?
to draw apart the body he hath kill whom his very madness , like some ore among a mineral of metals base , shows itself pure , he weeps for what is done .
o gertrude , come away !
the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch , but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must , with all our majesty and skill , both countenance and excuse .
ho , guildenstern !
rosencrantz and guildenstern friends both , go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain , and from his mother closet hath he dragg him go seek him out , speak fair , and bring the body into the chapel .
i pray you , haste in this .

o , come away !
my soul is full of discord and dismay .

enter hamlet safely stowed .
rosencrantz guildenstern within hamlet !
lord hamlet !
what noise ?
who calls on hamlet ?
o , here they come .
enter rosencrantz and guildenstern what have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
compounded it with dust , whereto is kin .
tell us where is , that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel .
do not believe it .
believe what ?
that i can keep your counsel and not mine own .
besides , to be demanded of a sponge !
what replication should be made by the son of a king ?
take you me for a sponge , my lord ?
ay , sir , that soaks up the king countenance , his rewards , his authorities .
but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them , like an ape , in the corner of his jaw , first mouthed , to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned , it is but squeezing you , and , sponge , you shall be dry again .
i understand you not , my lord .
i am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear .
my lord , you must tell us where the body is , and go with us to the king .
the body is with the king , but the king is not with the body .
the king is a thing a thing , my lord !
of nothing bring me to him .
hide fox , and all after .
exeunt scene iii .
another room in the castle .
enter king claudius , attended i have sent to seek him , and to find the body .
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose !
yet must not we put the strong law on him he loved of the distracted multitude , who like not in their judgment , but their eyes , and where tis so , the offender scourge is weigh , but never the offence .
to bear all smooth and even , this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved , or not at all .
enter rosencrantz how now !
what hath ?
where the dead body is bestow , my lord , we can not get from him .
but where is he ?
without , my lord , guarded , to know your pleasure .
bring him before us .
ho , guildenstern !
bring in my lord .
enter hamlet and guildenstern now , hamlet , where polonius ?
at supper .
at supper !
where ?
not where he eats , but where he is eaten a certain convocation of politic worms are at him .
your worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all creatures else to fat us , and we fat ourselves for maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service , two dishes , but to one table that the end .
alas , alas !
a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king , and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm .
what dost you mean by this ?
nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar .
where is polonius ?
in heaven , send hither to see if your messenger find him not there , seek him i ' the other place yourself .
but indeed , if you find him not within this month , you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby .
go seek him there .
to some attendants he will stay till ye come .
exeunt attendants hamlet , this deed , for thine especial safety , which we do tender , as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done , must send thee hence with fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself , the bark is ready , and the wind at help , the associates tend , and every thing is bent for england .
for england !
ay , hamlet .
good .
so is it , if thou our purposes .
i see a cherub that sees them .
but , come , for england !
farewell , dear mother .
thy loving father , hamlet .
my mother father and mother is man and wife , man and wife is one flesh , and so , my mother .
come , for england !
exit follow him at foot , tempt him with speed aboard , delay it not , i have him hence away !
for every thing is seal and done that else leans on the affair pray you , make haste .
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern and , england , if my love thou at aught as my great power thereof may give thee sense , since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword , and thy free awe pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process , which imports at full , by letters congruing to that effect , the present death of hamlet .
do it , england , for like the hectic in my blood he rages , and thou must cure me till i know is done , my haps , my joys were begun .
exit scene iv .
a plain in denmark .
enter fortinbras , a captain , and soldiers , marching go , captain , from me greet the danish king , tell him that , by his licence , fortinbras craves the conveyance of a promised march over his kingdom .
you know the rendezvous .
if that his majesty would aught with us , we shall express our duty in his eye , and let him know so .
i will , my lord .
go softly on .
exeunt fortinbras and soldiers enter hamlet , rosencrantz , guildenstern , and others good sir , whose powers are these ?
they are of norway , sir .
how purposed , sir , i pray you ?
against some part of poland .
who commands them , sir ?
the nephews to old norway , fortinbras .
goes it against the main of poland , sir , or for some frontier ?
truly to speak , and with no addition , we go to gain a little patch of ground that hath in it no profit but the name .
to pay five ducats , five , i would not farm it , nor will it yield to norway or the pole a ranker rate , should it be sold in fee .
why , then the polack never will defend it .
yes , it is already garrison .
two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw this is the imposthume of much wealth and peace , that inward breaks , and shows no cause without why the man dies .
i humbly thank you , sir .
god be wi ' you , sir .
exit wilt please you go , my lord ?
i be with you straight go a little before .
exeunt all except hamlet how all occasions do inform against me , and spur my dull revenge !
what is a man , if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed ?
a beast , no more .
sure , he that made us with such large discourse , looking before and after , gave us not that capability and reason to fust in us unused .
now , whether it be bestial oblivion , or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on the event , a thought which , quarter , hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward , i do not know why yet i live to say thing to do , ' sith i have cause and will and strength and means to .
examples gross as earth exhort me witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince , whose spirit with divine ambition puff makes mouths at the invisible event , exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune , death and danger dare , even for an .
rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument , but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour at the stake .
how stand i then , that have a father kill , a mother stain , excitements of my reason and my blood , and let all sleep ?
while , to my shame , i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men , that , for a fantasy and trick of fame , go to their graves like beds , fight for a plot whereon the numbers can not try the cause , which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain ?
o , from this time forth , my thoughts be bloody , or be nothing worth !
exit scene elsinore .
a room in the castle .
enter queen gertrude , horatio , and a gentleman i will not speak with her .
she is importunate , indeed distract her mood will needs be pitied .
what would she have ?
she speaks much of her father , says she hears there tricks i ' the world , and hems , and beats her heart , spurns enviously at straws , speaks things in doubt , that carry but half sense her speech is nothing , yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to collection , they aim at it , and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts , which , as her winks , and nods , and gestures yield them , indeed would make one think there might be thought , though nothing sure , yet much unhappily .
good she were spoken with , for she may strew dangerous conjectures in minds .
let her come in .
exit horatio to my sick soul , as sin true nature is , each toy seems prologue to some great amiss so full of artless jealousy is guilt , it spills itself in fearing to be spilt .
horatio , with ophelia where is the beauteous majesty of denmark ?
how now , ophelia !
sings how should i your true love know from another one ?
by his cockle hat and staff , and his sandal shoon .
alas , sweet lady , what imports this song ?
say you ?
nay , pray you , mark .
sings he is dead and gone , lady , he is dead and gone , at his head a turf , at his heels a stone .
nay , but , ophelia , pray you , mark .
sings white his shroud as the mountain snow , enter king claudius alas , look here , my lord .
sings larded with sweet flowers which bewept to the grave did go with showers .
how do you , pretty lady ?
well , god you !
they say the owl was a baker daughter .
lord , we know what we are , but know not what we may be .
god be at your table !
conceit upon her father .
pray you , let have no words of this , but when they ask you what it means , say you this sings is saint valentine day , all in the morning betime , and i a maid at your window , to be your valentine .
then up he rose , and donn his clothes , and dupp the , let in the maid , that out a maid never departed more .
pretty ophelia !
indeed , la , without an oath , i make an end o sings by gis and by saint charity , alack , and fie for shame !
young men will , if they come , by cock , they are to blame .
quoth she , before you tumbled me , you promised me to so would i ha ' done , by yonder sun , an thou hadst not come to my bed .
how long hath she been thus ?
i hope all will be well .
we must be patient but i can not choose but weep , to think they should lay him i ' the cold ground .
my brother shall know of it and so i thank you for your good counsel .
come , my coach !
good night , ladies , good night , sweet ladies , good night , good night .
exit follow her close , give her good watch , i pray you .
exit horatio o , this is the poison of deep grief , it springs all from her father death .
o gertrude , gertrude , when sorrows come , they come not single spies but in battalions .
first , her father slain next , your son gone , and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied , thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers , for good polonius ' death , and we have done but greenly , in to inter him poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment , without the which we are pictures , or mere beasts last , and as much containing as all these , her brother is in secret come from france , feeds on his wonder , keeps himself in clouds , and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his father death , wherein necessity , of matter beggar , will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear .
o my dear gertrude , this , like to a , in many places gives me superfluous death .
a noise within alack , what noise is this ?
where are my switzers ?
let them guard the door .
enter another gentleman what is the matter ?
save yourself , my lord the ocean , overpeering of his list , eats not the flats with more impetuous haste than young laertes , in a riotous head , your officers .
the rabble call him lord , and , as the world were now but to begin , antiquity forgot , custom not known , the ratifiers and props of every word , they cry we laertes shall be king ' caps , hands , and tongues , applaud it to the clouds shall be king , laertes king ! '
how cheerfully on the false trail they cry !
o , this is counter , you false danish dogs !
the doors are broke .
noise within enter laertes , armed , danes following where is this king ?
sirs , stand you all without .
no , let come in .
i pray you , give me leave .
we will , we will .
they retire without the door i thank you keep the door .
o thou vile king , give me my father !
calmly , good laertes .
that drop of blood that calm proclaims me bastard , cries cuckold to my father , brands the harlot even here , between the chaste unsmirched brow of my true mother .
what is the cause , laertes , that thy rebellion looks so ?
let him go , gertrude , do not fear our person there such divinity doth hedge a king , that treason can but peep to what it would , acts little of his will .
tell me , laertes , why thou art thus incensed .
let him go , gertrude .
speak , man .
where is my father ?
dead .
but not by him .
let him demand his fill .
how came he dead ?
i not be juggled with to hell , allegiance !
vows , to the blackest devil !
conscience and grace , to the profoundest pit !
i dare damnation .
to this point i stand , that both the worlds i give to negligence , let come what comes , only i be revenged most thoroughly for my father .
who shall stay you ?
my will , not all the world and for my means , i husband them so well , they shall go far with little .
good laertes , if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father death , writ in your revenge , that , swoopstake , you will draw both friend and foe , winner and loser ?
none but his enemies .
will you know them then ?
to his good friends thus wide i ope my arms , and like the kind pelican , repast them with my blood .
why , now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman .
that i am guiltless of your father death , and am most sensible in grief for it , it shall as level to your judgment pierce as day does to your eye .
within let her come in .
how now !
what noise is that ?
ophelia o heat , dry up my brains !
tears seven times salt , burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
by heaven , thy madness shall be paid by weight , till our scale turn the beam .
o rose of may !
dear maid , kind sister , sweet ophelia !
o heavens !
possible , a young maid wits should be as moral as an old man life ?
nature is fine in love , and where is fine , it sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves .
sings they bore him barefaced on the bier , hey non nonny , nonny , hey nonny , and in his grave rain many a tear fare you well , my dove !
hadst thou thy wits , and didst persuade revenge , it could not move thus .
sings you must sing , an you call him .
o , how the wheel becomes it !
it is the false steward , that stole his master daughter .
this nothing more than matter .
there rosemary , that for remembrance , pray , love , remember and there is pansies .
that for thoughts .
a document in madness , thoughts and remembrance fitted .
there fennel for you , and columbines there rue for you , and here some for me we may call it o ' sundays o you must wear your rue with a difference .
there a daisy i would give you some violets , but they withered all when my father died they say he made a good end , sings for bonny sweet robin is all my joy .
thought and affliction , passion , hell itself , she turns to favour and to prettiness .
sings and will he not come again ?
and will he not come again ?
no , no , he is dead go to thy he never will come again .
his beard was as white as snow , all flaxen was his poll he is gone , he is gone , and we cast away moan god ha ' mercy on his soul !
and of all christian souls , i pray god .
god be wi ' ye .
exit do you see this , o god ?
laertes , i must commune with your grief , or you deny me right .
go but apart , make choice of whom your wisest friends you will .
and they shall hear and judge you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touch , we will our kingdom give , our crown , our life , and all that we can ours , to you in satisfaction , but if not , be you content to lend your patience to us , and we shall jointly labour with your soul to give it due content .
let this be so , his means of death , his obscure funeral no trophy , sword , nor hatchment his bones , no noble rite nor formal ostentation cry to be heard , as from heaven to earth , that i must in question .
so you shall , and where the offence is let the great axe fall .
i pray you , go with me .
exeunt scene vi .
another room in the castle .
enter horatio and a servant what are they that would speak with me ?
sailors , sir they say they have letters for you .
let them come in .
exit servant i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted , if not from lord hamlet .
enter sailors god bless you , sir .
let him bless thee too .
he shall , sir , a please him .
there a letter for you , sir , it comes from the ambassador that was bound for england , if your name be horatio , as i am let to know it is .
reads , when thou shalt have overlooked this , give these fellows some means to the king they have letters for him .
ere we were two days old at sea , a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase .
finding ourselves too slow of sail , we put on a compelled valour , and in the grapple i boarded them on the instant they got clear of our ship , so i alone became their prisoner .
they have dealt with me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they did , i am to do a good turn for them .
let the king have the letters i have sent , and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death .
i have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb , yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter .
these good fellows will bring thee where i am .
rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course for england of them i have much to tell thee .
farewell .
that thou knowest thine , hamlet . '
come , i will make you way for these your letters , and the speedier , that you may direct me to him from whom you brought them .
exeunt scene vii .
another room in the castle .
enter king claudius and laertes now must your conscience my acquaintance seal , and you must put me in your heart for friend , sith you have heard , and with a knowing ear , that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life .
it well appears but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats , so crimeful and so capital in nature , as by your safety , wisdom , all things else , you mainly were stirr up .
o , for two special reasons , which may to you , perhaps , seem much unsinew , but yet to me they are strong .
the queen his mother lives almost by his looks , and for myself my virtue or my plague , be it either which she so conjunctive to my life and soul , that , as the star moves not but in his sphere , i could not but by her .
the other motive , why to a public count i might not go , is the great love the general gender bear him , who , dipping all his faults in their affection , would , like the spring that turneth wood to stone , convert his gyves to graces , so that my arrows , too slightly timber for so loud a wind , would have reverted to my bow again , and not where i had aim them .
and so have i a noble father lost , a sister driven into desperate terms , whose worth , if praises may go back again , stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come .
break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime .
you shortly shall hear more i loved your father , and we love ourself , and that , i hope , will teach you to imagine enter a messenger how now !
what news ?
letters , my lord , from hamlet this to your majesty , this to the queen .
from hamlet !
who brought them ?
sailors , my lord , they say , i saw them not they were given me by claudio , he received them of him that brought them .
laertes , you shall hear them .
leave us .
exit messenger reads and mighty , you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom .
shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall , first asking your pardon thereunto , recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return .
. '
what should this mean ?
are all the rest come back ?
or is it some abuse , and no such thing ?
know you the hand ?
is hamlets character .
!
and in a postscript here , he says . '
can you advise me ?
i lost in it , my lord .
but let him come , it warms the very sickness in my heart , that i shall live and tell him to his teeth , didest thou . '
if it be so , laertes as how should it be so ?
how otherwise ? will you be ruled by me ?
ay , my lord , so you will not me to a peace .
to thine own peace .
if he be now return , as checking at his voyage , and that he means no more to undertake it , i will work him to an exploit , now ripe in my device , under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe , but even his mother shall uncharge the practise and call it accident .
my lord , i will be ruled , the rather , if you could devise it so that i might be the organ .
it falls right .
you have been talk of since your travel much , and that in hamlet hearing , for a quality wherein , they say , you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one , and that , in my regard , of the unworthiest siege .
what part is that , my lord ?
a very riband in the cap of youth , yet needful too , for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds , importing health and graveness .
two months since , here was a gentleman of normandy i seen myself , and served against , the french , and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft i , he grew unto his seat , and to such wondrous doing brought his horse , as he had been incorpsed and with the brave beast so far he topp my thought , that i , in forgery of shapes and tricks , come short of what he did .
a norman ?
a norman .
upon my life , lamond .
the very same .
i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation .
he made confession of you , and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially , that he cried out , be a sight indeed , if one could match you the scrimers of their nation , he swore , had had neither motion , guard , nor eye , if you opposed them .
sir , this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming , to play with him .
now , out of this , what out of this , my lord ?
laertes , was your father dear to you ?
or are you like the painting of a sorrow , a face without a heart ?
why ask you this ?
not that i think you did not love your father , but that i know love is begun by time , and that i see , in passages of proof , time qualifies the spark and fire of it .
there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it , and nothing is at a like goodness still , for goodness , growing to a plurisy , dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would , for this ' changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues , are hands , are accidents , and then this ' is like a spendthrift sigh , that hurts by easing .
but , to the quick o ' the ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake , to show yourself your father son in deed more than in words ?
to cut his throat i ' the church .
no place , indeed , should murder sanctuarize , revenge should have no bounds .
but , good laertes , will you do this , keep close within your chamber .
hamlet return shall know you are come home we put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you , bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he , being remiss , most generous and free from all contriving , will not peruse the foils , so that , with ease , or with a little shuffling , you may choose a sword unbated , and in a pass of practise requite him for your father .
i will and , for that purpose , i anoint my sword .
i bought an unction of a mountebank , so mortal that , but dip a knife in it , where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare , collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon , can save the thing from death that is but scratch withal i touch my point with this contagion , that , if i gall him slightly , it may be death .
let further think of this , weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail , and that our drift look through our bad performance , better not assay therefore this project should have a back or second , that might hold , if this should blast in proof .
soft !
let me see we make a solemn wager on your cunnings i .
when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink , i have prepared him a chalice for the nonce , whereon but sipping , if he by chance escape your venom stuck , our purpose may hold there .
enter queen gertrude how now , sweet queen !
one woe doth tread upon another heel , so fast they follow , your sister drown , laertes .
drown !
o , where ?
there is a willow grows aslant a brook , that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream , there with fantastic garlands did she come of , nettles , daisies , and long purples that liberal shepherds give a grosser name , but our cold maids do dead men fingers call them there , on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang , an envious sliver broke , when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook .
her clothes spread wide , and , , awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old tunes , as one incapable of her own distress , or like a creature native and indued unto that element but long it could not be till that her garments , heavy with their drink , pull the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death .
alas , then , she is drown ?
drown , drown .
too much of water hast thou , poor ophelia , and therefore i forbid my tears but yet it is our trick , nature her custom holds , let shame say what it will when these are gone , the woman will be out .
adieu , my lord i have a speech of fire , that fain would blaze , but that this folly douts it .
exit let follow , gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage !
now fear i this will give it start again , therefore let follow .
exeunt act v scene i .
a churchyard .
enter two clowns , with spades , and c is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation ?
i tell thee she is and therefore make her grave straight the crowner hath sat on her , and finds it christian burial .
how can that be , unless she drowned herself in her own defence ?
why , is found so .
it must be offendendo , ' it can not be else .
for here lies the point if i drown myself wittingly , it argues an act and an act hath three branches it is , to act , to do , to perform argal , she drowned herself wittingly .
nay , but hear you , goodman delver , give me leave .
here lies the water , good here stands the man , good , if the man go to this water , and drown himself , it is , will he , nill he , he goes , mark you that , but if the water come to him and drown him , he drowns not himself argal , he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life .
but is this law ?
ay , marry , , crowner quest law .
will you ha ' the truth o ?
if this had not been a gentlewoman , she should have been buried out o ' christian burial .
why , there thou and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves , more than their even christian .
come , my spade .
there is no ancient gentleman but gardeners , ditchers , and they hold up adam profession .
was he a gentleman ?
he was the first that ever bore arms .
why , he had none .
what , art a heathen ?
how dost thou understand the scripture ?
the scripture says digged ' could he dig without arms ?
i put another question to thee if thou answerest me not to the purpose , confess thyself go to .
what is he that builds stronger than either the mason , the shipwright , or the carpenter ?
the , for that frame outlives a thousand tenants .
i like thy wit well , in good faith the gallows does well , but how does it well ?
it does well to those that do in now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church argal , the gallows may do well to thee .
again , come .
builds stronger than a mason , a shipwright , or a carpenter ? '
ay , tell me that , and unyoke .
marry , now i can tell .
.
mass , i can not tell .
enter hamlet and horatio , at a distance cudgel thy brains no more about it , for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating , and , when you are asked this question next , say ' a houses that he makes last till doomsday .
go , get thee to yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquor .
exit second clown he digs and sings in youth , when i did love , did love , methought it was very sweet , to contract , o , the time , for , ah , my behove , o , methought , there was nothing meet .
has this fellow no feeling of his business , that he sings at ?
custom hath made it in him a property of easiness .
is so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense .
sings but age , with his stealing steps , hath claw me in his clutch , and hath shipped me intil the land , as if i had never been such .
throws up a skull that skull had a tongue in it , and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground , as if it were cain , that did the first murder !
it might be the pate of a politician , which this ass now , one that would circumvent god , might it not ?
it might , my lord .
or of a courtier , which could say morrow , sweet lord !
how dost thou , good lord ? '
this might be my lord , that praised my lord horse , when he meant to beg it , might it not ?
ay , my lord .
why , so and now my lady worm , chapless , and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton spade here fine revolution , an we had the trick to .
did these bones cost no more the breeding , but to play at loggats with ?
mine ache to think o .
sings a , and a spade , a spade , for and a shrouding sheet o , a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet .
throws up another skull there another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer ?
where be his quiddities now , his quillets , his cases , his tenures , and his tricks ?
why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel , and will not tell him of his action of battery ?
hum !
this fellow might be in time a great buyer of land , with his statutes , his recognizances , his fines , his double vouchers , his recoveries is this the fine of his fines , and the recovery of his recoveries , to have his fine pate full of fine dirt ?
will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases , and double ones too , than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures ?
the very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box , and must the inheritor himself have no more , ha ?
not a jot more , my lord .
is not parchment made of sheepskins ?
ay , my lord , and of too .
they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that .
i will speak to this fellow .
whose grave this , sirrah ?
mine , sir .
sings o , a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet .
i think it be thine , indeed , for thou liest i .
you lie out o , sir , and therefore it is not yours for my part , i do not lie i , and yet it is mine .
dost lie i , to be i and say it is thine is for the dead , not for the quick , therefore thou liest .
is a quick lie , sir , away gain , from me to you .
what man dost thou dig it for ?
for no man , sir .
what woman , then ?
for none , neither .
who is to be buried i ?
one that was a woman , sir , but , rest her soul , she dead .
how absolute the knave is !
we must speak by the card , or equivocation will undo us .
by the lord , horatio , these three years i have taken a note of it , the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier , he gaffs his kibe .
how long hast thou been a ?
of all the days i ' the year , i came that day that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras .
how long is that since ?
can not you tell that ?
every fool can tell that it was the very day that young hamlet was born , he that is mad , and sent into england .
ay , marry , why was he sent into england ?
why , because he was mad he shall recover his wits there , or , if he do not , it no great matter there .
why ?
, a not be seen in him there , there the men are as mad as he .
how came he mad ?
very strangely , they say .
how strangely ?
faith , with losing his wits .
upon what ground ?
why , here in denmark i have been sexton here , man and boy , thirty years .
how long will a man lie i ' the earth ere he rot ?
i ' faith , if he be not rotten before he die as we have many pocky corses , that will scarce hold the laying in he will last you some eight year or nine year a tanner will last you nine year .
why he more than another ?
why , sir , his hide is so tanned with his trade , that he will keep out water a great while , and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body .
here a skull now , this skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years .
whose was it ?
a whoreson mad fellow it was whose do you think it was ?
nay , i know not .
a pestilence on him for a mad rogue !
a ' poured a flagon of rhenish on my head once .
this same skull , sir , was yorick skull , the king jester .
this ?
that .
let me see .
takes the skull alas , poor yorick !
i knew him , horatio a fellow of infinite jest , of most excellent fancy he hath borne me on his back a thousand times , and now , how abhorred in my imagination it is !
my gorge rims at it .
here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft .
where be your gibes now ?
your gambols ?
your songs ?
your flashes of merriment , that were wont to set the table on a roar ?
not one now , to mock your own grinning ?
quite ?
now get you to my lady chamber , and tell her , let her paint an inch thick , to this favour she must come , make her laugh at that .
prithee , horatio , tell me one thing .
what that , my lord ?
dost thou think alexander looked o ' this fashion i ' the earth ?
so .
and smelt so ?
pah !
puts down the skull so , my lord .
to what base uses we may return , horatio !
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander , till he find it stopping a ?
to consider too curiously , to consider so .
no , faith , not a jot , but to follow him thither with modesty enough , and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died , alexander was buried , alexander returneth into dust , the dust is earth , of earth we make loam , and why of that loam , whereto he was converted , might they not stop a ?
imperious caesar , dead and turn to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away o , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw !
but soft !
but soft !
aside here comes the king .
enter priest , and in procession , the corpse of ophelia , laertes and mourners following , king claudius , queen gertrude , their trains , and c the queen , the courtiers who is this they follow ?
and with such maimed rites ?
this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo its own life was of some estate .
couch we awhile , and mark .
retiring with horatio what ceremony else ?
that is laertes , a very noble youth mark .
what ceremony else ?
her obsequies have been as far enlarged as we have warrantise her death was doubtful , and , but that great command the order , she should in ground unsanctified have lodged till the last trumpet for charitable prayers , shards , flints and pebbles should be thrown on her , yet here she is allow her virgin crants , her maiden strewments and the bringing home of bell and burial .
must there no more be done ?
no more be done we should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem and such rest to her as to souls .
lay her i ' the earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring !
i tell thee , churlish priest , a ministering angel shall my sister be , when thou liest howling .
what , the fair ophelia !
sweets to the sweet farewell !
scattering flowers i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlet wife , i thought thy to have deck , sweet maid , and not have strew thy grave .
o , treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head , whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of !
hold off the earth awhile , till i have caught her once more in mine arms leaps into the grave now pile your dust upon the quick and dead , till of this flat a mountain you have made , to old pelion , or the skyish head of blue olympus .
advancing what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis ?
whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars , and makes them stand like hearers ?
this is i , hamlet the dane .
leaps into the grave the devil take thy soul !
grappling with him thou not well .
i prithee , take thy fingers from my throat , for , though i am not splenitive and rash , yet have i something in me dangerous , which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand .
pluck them asunder .
hamlet , hamlet !
gentlemen , good my lord , be quiet .
the attendants part them , and they come out of the grave why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag .
o my son , what theme ?
i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not , with all their quantity of love , make up my sum .
what wilt thou do for her ?
o , he is mad , laertes .
for love of god , forbear him .
, show me what do weep ?
fight ?
fast ?
tear thyself ?
drink up eisel ?
eat a crocodile ?
i .
dost thou come here to whine ?
to outface me with leaping in her grave ?
be buried quick with her , and so will i and , if thou prate of mountains , let them throw millions of acres on us , till our ground , singeing his pate against the burning zone , make ossa like a wart !
nay , an mouth , i rant as well as thou .
this is mere madness and thus awhile the fit will work on him , anon , as patient as the female dove , when that her golden couplets are disclosed , his silence will sit drooping .
hear you , sir , what is the reason that you use me thus ?
i loved you ever but it is no matter , let hercules himself do what he may , the cat will mew and dog will have his day .
exit i pray you , good horatio , wait upon him .
exit horatio to laertes strengthen your patience in our last night speech , we put the matter to the present push .
good gertrude , set some watch over your son .
this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet shortly shall we see , till then , in patience our proceeding be .
exeunt scene ii .
a hall in the castle .
enter hamlet and horatio so much for this , sir now shall you see the other , you do remember all the circumstance ?
remember it , my lord ?
sir , in my heart there was a kind of fighting , that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes .
rashly , and praised be rashness for it , let us know , our indiscretion sometimes serves us well , when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us there a divinity that shapes our ends , them how we will , that is most certain .
up from my cabin , my scarf about me , in the dark groped i to find out them , had my desire .
finger their packet , and in fine withdrew to mine own room again , making so bold , my fears forgetting manners , to unseal their grand commission , where i found , horatio , o royal knavery ! an exact command , larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark health and england too , with , ho !
such bugs and goblins in my life , that , on the supervise , no leisure bated , no , not to stay the grinding of the axe , my head should be struck off .
possible ?
here the commission read it at more leisure .
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed ?
i beseech you .
being thus round with villanies , ere i could make a prologue to my brains , they had begun the play i sat me down , devised a new commission , wrote it fair i once did hold it , as our statists do , a baseness to write fair and labour much how to forget that learning , but , sir , now it did me yeoman service wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote ?
ay , good my lord .
an earnest conjuration from the king , as england was his faithful tributary , as love between them like the palm might flourish , as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma their amities , and many of great charge , that , on the view and knowing of these contents , without debatement further , more or less , he should the bearers put to sudden death , not allow .
how was this seal ?
why , even in that was heaven ordinant .
i had my father signet in my purse , which was the model of that danish seal , folded the writ up in form of the other , subscribed it , the impression , placed it safely , the changeling never known .
now , the next day was our , and what to this was sequent thou already .
so guildenstern and rosencrantz go .
why , man , they did make love to this employment , they are not near my conscience , their defeat does by their own insinuation grow is dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites .
why , what a king is this !
does it not , thee , stand me now upon he that hath kill my king and whored my mother , popp in between the election and my hopes , thrown out his angle for my proper life , and with such cozenage not perfect conscience , to quit him with this arm ?
and not to be damn , to let this canker of our nature come in further evil ?
it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there .
it will be short the interim is mine , and a man life no more than to say . '
but i am very sorry , good horatio , that to laertes i forgot myself , for , by the image of my cause , i see the portraiture of his i court his favours .
but , sure , the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion .
peace !
who comes here ?
enter osric your lordship is right welcome back to denmark .
i humbly thank you , sir .
dost know this ?
no , my good lord .
thy state is the more gracious , for is a vice to know him .
he hath much land , and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts , and his crib shall stand at the king mess is a chough , but , as i say , spacious in the possession of dirt .
sweet lord , if your lordship were at leisure , i should impart a thing to you from his majesty .
i will receive it , sir , with all diligence of spirit .
put your bonnet to his right use , is for the head .
i thank your lordship , it is very hot .
no , believe me , is very cold , the wind is northerly .
it is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
exceedingly , my lord , it is very sultry , as , i can not tell how .
but , my lord , his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir , this is the matter , i beseech you , remember hamlet moves him to put on his hat nay , good my lord , for mine ease , in good faith .
sir , here is newly come to court laertes , believe me , an absolute gentleman , full of most excellent differences , of very soft society and great showing indeed , to speak feelingly of him , he is the card or calendar of gentry , for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see .
sir , his definement suffers no perdition in you , though , i know , to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory , and yet but yaw neither , in respect of his quick sail .
but , in the verity of extolment , i take him to be a soul of great article , and his infusion of such dearth and rareness , as , to make true diction of him , his semblable is his mirror , and who else would trace him , his umbrage , nothing more .
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him .
the concernancy , sir ?
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath ?
sir ?
not possible to understand in another tongue ?
you will , sir , really .
what imports the nomination of this gentleman ?
of laertes ?
his purse is empty already , all golden words are spent .
of him , sir .
i know you are not ignorant i would you did , sir , yet , in faith , if you did , it would not much approve me .
well , sir ?
you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is i dare not confess that , lest i should compare with him in excellence , but , to know a man well , were to know himself .
i mean , sir , for his weapon , but in the imputation laid on him by them , in his meed he unfellowed .
what his weapon ?
rapier and dagger .
that two of his weapons but , well .
the king , sir , hath wagered with him six barbary horses against the which he has imponed , as i take it , six french rapiers and poniards , with their assigns , as girdle , hangers , and so three of the carriages , in faith , are very dear to fancy , very responsive to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberal conceit .
what call you the carriages ?
i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done .
the carriages , sir , are the hangers .
the phrase would be more german to the matter , if we could carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then .
but , on six barbary horses against six french swords , their assigns , and three carriages , that the french bet against the danish .
why is this , ' as you call it ?
the king , sir , hath laid , that in a dozen passes between yourself and him , he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine , and it would come to immediate trial , if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer .
how if i answer ' ?
i mean , my lord , the opposition of your person in trial .
sir , i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty , is the breathing time of day with me , let the foils be brought , the gentleman willing , and the king hold his purpose , i will win for him an i can , if not , i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits .
shall i you so ?
to this effect , sir , after what flourish your nature will .
i commend my duty to your lordship .
yours , yours .
exit osric he does well to commend it himself , there are no tongues else for turn .
this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head .
he did comply with his dug , before he sucked it .
thus has he and many more of the same bevy that i know the dressy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter , a kind of yesty collection , which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions , and do but blow them to their trial , the bubbles are out .
enter a lord my lord , his majesty commended him to you by young osric , who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes , or that you will take longer time .
i am constant to my purpose , they follow the king pleasure if his fitness speaks , mine is ready , now or whensoever , provided i be so able as now .
the king and queen and all are coming down .
in happy time .
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play .
she well instructs me .
exit lord you will lose this wager , my lord .
i do not think so since he went into france , i have been in continual practise i shall win at the odds .
but thou wouldst not think how ill all here about my heart but it is no matter .
nay , good my lord , it is but foolery , but it is such a kind of , as would perhaps trouble a woman .
if your mind dislike any thing , obey it i will forestall their repair hither , and say you are not fit .
not a whit , we defy augury there a special providence in the fall of a sparrow .
if it be now , is not to come , if it be not to come , it will be now , if it be not now , yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves , what to leave betimes ?
enter king claudius , queen gertrude , laertes , lords , osric , and attendants with foils , and c come , hamlet , come , and take this hand from me .
king claudius puts laertes ' hand into hamlet give me your pardon , sir i done you wrong , but pardo , as you are a gentleman .
this presence knows , and you must needs have heard , how i am punish with sore distraction .
what i have done , that might your nature , honour and exception roughly awake , i here proclaim was madness .
hamlet wrong laertes ?
never hamlet if hamlet from himself be away , and when he not himself does wrong laertes , then hamlet does it not , hamlet denies it .
who does it , then ?
his madness be so , hamlet is of the faction that is wrong , his madness is poor hamlet enemy .
sir , in this audience , let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts , that i have shot mine arrow the house , and hurt my brother .
i am satisfied in nature , whose motive , in this case , should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honour i stand aloof , and will no reconcilement , till by some elder masters , of known honour , i have a voice and precedent of peace , to keep my name ungored .
but till that time , i do receive your offer love like love , and will not wrong it .
i embrace it freely , and will this brother wager frankly play .
give us the foils .
come on .
come , one for me .
i be your foil , laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall , like a star i ' the darkest night , stick fiery off indeed .
you mock me , sir .
no , by this hand .
give them the foils , young osric .
cousin hamlet , you know the wager ?
very well , my lord your grace hath laid the odds o ' the weaker side .
i do not fear it , i have seen you both but since he is better , we have therefore odds .
this is too heavy , let me see another .
this likes me well .
these foils have all a length ?
they prepare to play ay , my good lord .
set me the stoops of wine upon that table .
if hamlet give the first or second hit , or quit in answer of the third exchange , let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet better breath , and in the cup an union shall he throw , richer than that which four successive kings in denmark crown have worn .
give me the cups , and let the kettle to the trumpet speak , the trumpet to the cannoneer without , the cannons to the heavens , the heavens to earth , the king dunks to hamlet . '
come , begin and you , the judges , bear a wary eye .
come on , sir .
come , my lord .
they play one .
no .
judgment .
a hit , a very palpable hit .
well , again .
stay , give me drink .
hamlet , this pearl is thine , here to thy health .
trumpets sound , and cannon shot off within give him the cup .
i play this bout first , set it by awhile .
come .
they play another hit , what say you ?
a touch , a touch , i do confess .
our son shall win .
he fat , and scant of breath .
here , hamlet , take my napkin , rub thy brows , the queen carouses to thy fortune , hamlet .
good madam !
gertrude , do not drink .
i will , my lord , i pray you , pardon me .
aside it is the poison cup it is too late .
i dare not drink yet , madam , by and by .
come , let me wipe thy face .
my lord , i hit him now .
i do not .
aside and yet is almost my conscience .
come , for the third , laertes you but dally , i pray you , pass with your best violence , i am afeard you make a wanton of me .
say you so ?
come on .
they play nothing , neither way .
have at you now !
laertes wounds hamlet , then in scuffling , they change rapiers , and hamlet wounds laertes part them , they are incensed .
nay , come , again .
queen gertrude falls look to the queen there , ho !
they bleed on both sides .
how is it , my lord ?
how , laertes ?
why , as a woodcock to mine own springe , osric , i am justly kill with mine own treachery .
how does the queen ?
she swounds to see them bleed .
no , no , the drink , the drink , o my dear hamlet , the drink , the drink !
i am poison .
dies o villany !
ho !
let the door be lock treachery !
seek it out .
it is here , hamlet hamlet , thou art slain , no medicine in the world can do thee good , in thee there is not half an hour of life , the treacherous instrument is in thy hand , unbated and envenom the foul practise hath turn itself on me lo , here i lie , never to rise again thy mother poison i can no more the king , the king to blame .

exchange forgiveness with me , noble hamlet mine and my father death come not upon thee , nor thine on me .
dies heaven make thee free of it !
i follow thee .
i am dead , horatio .
wretched queen , adieu !

never believe it i am more an antique roman than a dane here yet some liquor left .
as a man , give me the cup let go , by heaven , i .
o good horatio , what a wounded name , things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me !
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile , and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain , to tell my story .
march afar off , and shot within what warlike noise is this ?
young fortinbras , with conquest come from poland , to the ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley .
o , i die , horatio , the potent poison quite my spirit i can not live to hear the news from england , but i do prophesy the election lights on fortinbras he has my dying voice , so tell him , with the occurrents , more and less , which have solicited .
the rest is silence .
dies now cracks a noble heart .
good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest !
why does the drum come hither ?
march within enter fortinbras , the english ambassadors , and others where is this sight ?
what is it ye would see ?
if aught of woe or wonder , cease your search .
this quarry cries on havoc .
o proud death , what feast is toward in thine eternal cell , that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck ?
the sight is dismal , and our affairs from england come too late the ears are senseless that should give us hearing , to tell him his commandment is fulfill , that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead where should we have our thanks ?
not from his mouth , had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death .
but since , so jump upon this bloody question , you from the polack wars , and you from england , are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view , and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal , bloody , and unnatural acts , of accidental judgments , casual slaughters , of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause , and , in this upshot , purposes mistook on the inventors ' reads all this can i truly deliver .
let us haste to hear it , and call the noblest to the audience .
for me , with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory in this kingdom , which now to claim my vantage doth invite me .
of that i shall have also cause to speak , and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more , but let this same be presently perform , even while men minds are wild , lest more mischance on plots and errors , happen .
let four captains bear hamlet , like a soldier , to the stage , for he was likely , had he been put on , to have proved most royally and , for his passage , the soldiers ' music and the rites of war speak loudly for him .
take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field , but here shows much amiss .
go , bid the soldiers shoot .
a dead march .
exeunt , bearing off the dead bodies , after which a peal of ordnance is shot off act i prologue enter chorus o for a muse of fire , that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention , a kingdom for a stage , princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene !
then should the warlike harry , like himself , assume the port of mars , and at his heels , leash in like hounds , should famine , sword and fire crouch for employment .
but pardon , and gentles all , the flat unraised spirits that have dared on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of france ?
or may we cram within this wooden o the very casques that did affright the air at agincourt ?
o , pardon !
since a crooked figure may attest in little place a million , and let us , ciphers to this great accompt , on your imaginary forces work .
suppose within the girdle of these walls are now confined two mighty monarchies , whose high upreared and abutting fronts the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder piece out our imperfections with your thoughts , into a thousand parts divide on man , and make imaginary puissance , think when we talk of horses , that you see them printing their proud hoofs i ' the receiving earth , for is your thoughts that now must deck our kings , carry them here and there , jumping times , turning the accomplishment of many years into an for the which supply , admit me chorus to this history , who your humble patience pray , gently to hear , kindly to judge , our play .
exit scene london .
an in the king palace .
enter the archbishop of canterbury , and the bishop of ely my lord , i tell you , that self bill is urged , which in the eleventh year of the last king reign was like , and had indeed against us pass , but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question .
but how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?
it must be thought on .
if it pass against us , we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us , being valued thus as much as would maintain , to the king honour , full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , six thousand and two hundred good esquires , and , to relief of lazars and weak age , of indigent faint souls past corporal toil .
a hundred almshouses right well supplied , and to the coffers of the king beside , a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill .
this would drink deep .
drink the cup and all .
but what prevention ?
the king is full of grace and fair regard .
and a true lover of the holy church .
the courses of his youth promised it not .
the breath no sooner left his father body , but that his wildness , mortified in him , seem to die too , yea , at that very moment consideration , like an angel , came and whipp the offending adam out of him , leaving his body as a paradise , to envelop and contain celestial spirits .
never was such a sudden scholar made , never came reformation in a flood , with such a heady currance , scouring faults nor never wilfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king .
we are blessed in the change .
hear him but reason in divinity , and with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs , you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war , and you shall hear a fearful battle render you in music turn him to any cause of policy , the gordian knot of it he will unloose , familiar as his garter that , when he speaks , the air , a charter libertine , is still , and the mute wonder lurketh in men ears , to steal his sweet and honey sentences , so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it , since his addiction was to courses vain , his companies unletter , rude and shallow , his hours fill up with riots , banquets , sports , and never noted in him any study , any retirement , any sequestration from open haunts and popularity .
the strawberry grows underneath the nettle and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best neighbour by fruit of baser quality and so the prince obscured his contemplation under the veil of wildness , which , no doubt , grew like the summer grass , fastest by night , unseen , yet crescive in his faculty .
it must be so , for miracles are ceased , and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected .
but , my good lord , how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the commons ?
doth his majesty incline to it , or no ?
he seems indifferent , or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing the exhibiters against us , for i have made an offer to his majesty , upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand , which i have open to his grace at large , as touching france , to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal .
how did this offer seem received , my lord ?
with good acceptance of his majesty , save that there was not time enough to hear , as i perceived his grace would fain have done , the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward , his .
what was the impediment that broke this off ?
the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience , and the hour , i think , is come to give him hearing is it four ?
it is .
then go we in , to know his embassy , which i could with a ready guess declare , before the frenchman speak a word of it .
i wait upon you , and i long to hear it .
exeunt scene ii .
the same .
the presence chamber .
enter king henry v , gloucester , bedford , exeter , warwick , westmoreland , and attendants where is my gracious lord of canterbury ?
not here in presence .
send for him , good uncle .
shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?
not yet , my cousin we would be resolved , before we hear him , of some things of weight that task our thoughts , concerning us and france .
enter the archbishop of canterbury , and the bishop of ely god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it !
sure , we thank you .
my learned lord , we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salique that they have in france or should , or should not , bar us in our claim and god forbid , my dear and faithful lord , that you should fashion , wrest , or bow your reading , or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate , whose right suits not in native colours with the truth , for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to .
therefore take heed how you impawn our person , how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you , in the name of god , take heed , for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood , whose guiltless drops are every one a woe , a sore complaint him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords that make such waste in brief mortality .
under this conjuration , speak , my lord , for we will hear , note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience wash as pure as sin with baptism .
then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers , that owe yourselves , your lives and services to this imperial throne .
there is no bar to make against your highness ' claim to france but this , which they produce from pharamond , terram salicam mulieres ne succedant ' woman shall succeed in salique land ' which salique land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france , and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar .
yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany , between the floods of sala and of elbe , where charles the great , having subdued the saxons , there left behind and settled certain french , who , holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life , establish then this law , to wit , no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique , as i said , elbe and sala , is at this day in germany call meisen .
then doth it well appear that salique law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond , idly supposed the founder of this law , who died within the year of our redemption four hundred , and charles the great subdued the saxons , and did seat the french beyond the river sala , in the year eight hundred five .
besides , their writers say , king pepin , which deposed childeric , did , as heir general , being descended of blithild , which was daughter to king clothair , make claim and title to the crown of france .
hugh capet also , who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorraine , sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great , to find his title with some shows of truth , , in pure truth , it was corrupt and naught , convey himself as heir to the lady lingare , daughter to charlemain , who was the son to lewis the emperor , and lewis the son of charles the great .
also king lewis the tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper capet , could not keep quiet in his conscience , wearing the crown of france , till satisfied that fair queen isabel , his grandmother , was lineal of the lady ermengare , daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was to the crown of france .
so that , as clear as is the summer sun .
king pepin title and hugh capet claim , king lewis his satisfaction , all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day , howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claiming from the female , and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurp from you and your progenitors .
may i with right and conscience make this claim ?
the sin upon my head , dread sovereign !
for in the book of numbers is it writ , when the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter .
gracious lord , stand for your own , unwind your bloody flag , look back into your mighty ancestors go , my dread lord , to your tomb , from whom you claim , invoke his warlike spirit , and your , edward the black prince , who on the french ground play a tragedy , making defeat on the full power of france , whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion whelp forage in blood of french nobility .
o noble english .
that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by , all out of work and cold for action !
awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats you are their heir , you sit upon their throne , the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins , and my liege is in the very of his youth , ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises .
your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself , as did the former lions of your blood .
they know your grace hath cause and means and might , so hath your highness , never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects , whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie pavilion in the fields of france .
o , let their bodies follow , my dear liege , with blood and sword and fire to win your right , in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors .
we must not only arm to invade the french , but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot , who will make road upon us with all advantages .
they of those marches , gracious sovereign , shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers .
we do not mean the coursing snatchers only , but fear the main intendment of the scot , who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us , for you shall read that my never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnish kingdom came pouring , like the tide into a breach , with ample and brim fulness of his force , galling the gleaned land with hot assays , girding with grievous siege castles and towns , that england , being empty of defence , hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood .
she hath been then more fear than harm , my liege , for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles , she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots , whom she did send to france , to fill king edward fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries .
but there a saying very old and true , that you will france win , then with scotland first begin ' for once the eagle england being in prey , to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs , playing the mouse in absence of the cat , to tear and havoc more than she can eat .
it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crush necessity , since we have locks to safeguard necessaries , and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves .
while that the armed hand doth fight abroad , the advised head defends itself at home , for government , though high and low and lower , put into parts , doth keep in one consent , congreeing in a full and natural close , like music .
therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions , setting endeavour in continual motion , to which is fixed , as an aim or butt , obedience for so work the , creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom .
they have a king and officers of sorts , where some , like magistrates , correct at home , others , like merchants , venture trade abroad , others , like soldiers , armed in their stings , make boot upon the summer velvet buds , which pillage they with merry march bring home to the of their emperor , who , busied in his majesty , surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold , the civil citizens kneading up the honey , the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate , the justice , with his surly hum , delivering to executors pale the lazy yawning drone .
i this infer , that many things , having full reference to one consent , may work contrariously as many arrows , loosed several ways , come to one mark , as many ways meet in one town , as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea , as many lines close in the dial centre , so may a thousand actions , once afoot .
end in one purpose , and be all well borne without defeat .
therefore to france , my liege .
divide your happy england into four , whereof take you one quarter into france , and you withal shall make all gallia shake .
if we , with thrice such powers left at home , can not defend our own doors from the dog , let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy .
call in the messengers sent from the dauphin .
exeunt some attendants now are we well resolved , and , by god help , and yours , the noble sinews of our power , france being ours , we bend it to our awe , or break it all to pieces or there we sit , ruling in large and ample empery france and all her almost kingly dukedoms , or lay these bones in an unworthy urn , tombless , with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts , or else our grave , like turkish mute , shall have a tongueless mouth , not worshipp with a waxen epitaph .
enter ambassadors of france now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin , for we hear your greeting is from him , not from the king .
please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge , or shall we sparingly show you far off the dauphin meaning and our embassy ?
we are no tyrant , but a christian king , unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretches fetter in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphin mind .
thus , then , in few .
your highness , lately sending into france , did claim some certain dukedoms , in the right of your great predecessor , king edward the third .
in answer of which claim , the prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth , and bids you be advised there nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won , you can not revel into dukedoms there .
he therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit , this tun of treasure , and , in lieu of this , desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you .
this the dauphin speaks .
what treasure , uncle ?
, my liege .
we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us , his present and your pains we thank you for when we have march our rackets to these balls , we will , in france , by god grace , play a set shall strike his father crown into the hazard .
tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturb with chaces .
and we understand him well , how he comes us with our wilder days , not measuring what use we made of them .
we never valued this poor seat of england , and therefore , living hence , did give ourself to barbarous licence , as is ever common that men are merriest when they are from home .
but tell the dauphin i will keep my state , be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for , but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france , yea , strike the dauphin blind to look on us .
and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turn his balls to , and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands , mock mothers from their sons , mock castles down , and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin scorn .
but this lies all within the will of god , to whom i do appeal , and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on , to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a cause .
so get you hence in peace , and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit , when thousands weep more than did laugh at it .
convey them with safe conduct .
fare you well .
exeunt ambassadors this was a merry message .
we hope to make the sender blush at it .
therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour that may give furtherance to our expedition , for we have now no thought in us but france , save those to god , that run before our business .
therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings , for , god before , we chide this dauphin at his father door .
therefore let every man now task his thought , that this fair action may on foot be brought .
exeunt .
flourish act ii prologue enter chorus now all the youth of england are on fire , and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies now thrive the armourers , and honour thought reigns solely in the breast of every man they sell the pasture now to buy the horse , following the mirror of all christian kings , with winged heels , as english mercuries .
for now sits expectation in the air , and hides a sword from hilts unto the point with crowns imperial , crowns and coronets , promised to harry and his followers .
the french , advised by good intelligence of this most dreadful preparation , shake in their fear and with pale policy seek to divert the english purposes .
o england !
model to thy inward greatness , like little body with a mighty heart , what mightst thou do , that honour would thee do , were all thy children kind and natural !
but see thy fault !
france hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms , which he fills with treacherous crowns , and three corrupted men , one , richard earl of cambridge , and the second , henry lord scroop of masham , and the third , sir thomas grey , knight , of northumberland , have , for the gilt of france , o guilt indeed !
confirm conspiracy with fearful france , and by their hands this grace of kings must die , if hell and treason hold their promises , ere he take ship for france , and in southampton .
linger your patience on , and we digest the abuse of distance , force a play the sum is paid , the traitors are agreed , the king is set from london , and the scene is now transported , gentles , to southampton , there is the playhouse now , there must you sit and thence to france shall we convey you safe , and bring you back , charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass , for , if we may , we not offend one stomach with our play .
but , till the king come forth , and not till then , unto southampton do we shift our scene .

as if allegiance in their bosoms sat , crowned with faith and constant loyalty .

nay , but the man that was his bedfellow , whom he hath dull and cloy with gracious favours , that he should , for a foreign purse , so sell his sovereign life to death and treachery .
trumpets sound .
enter king henry v , scroop , cambridge , grey , and attendants now sits the wind fair , and we will aboard .
my lord of cambridge , and my kind lord of masham , and you , my gentle knight , give me your thoughts think you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of france , doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them ?
no doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .
i doubt not that , since we are well persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours , nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us .
never was monarch better fear and loved than is your majesty there not , i think , a subject that sits in and uneasiness under the sweet shade of your government .
true those that were your father enemies have steep their galls in honey and do serve you with hearts create of duty and of zeal .
we therefore have great cause of thankfulness , and shall forget the office of our hand , sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness .
so service shall with steeled sinews toil , and labour shall refresh itself with hope , to do your grace incessant services .
we judge no less .
uncle of exeter , enlarge the man committed yesterday , that rail against our person we consider it was excess of wine that set him on , and on his more advice we pardon him .
that mercy , but too much security let him be punish , sovereign , lest example breed , by his sufferance , more of such a kind .
o , let us yet be merciful .
so may your highness , and yet punish too .
sir , you show great mercy , if you give him life , after the taste of much correction .
alas , your too much love and care of me are heavy orisons this poor wretch !
if little faults , proceeding on distemper , shall not be wink at , how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes , chew , swallow and digested , appear before us ?
we yet enlarge that man , though cambridge , scroop and grey , in their dear care and tender preservation of our person , would have him punished .
and now to our french causes who are the late commissioners ?
i one , my lord your highness bade me ask for it .
so did you me , my liege .
and i , my royal sovereign .
then , richard earl of cambridge , there is yours , there yours , lord scroop of masham , and , sir knight , grey of northumberland , this same is yours read them , and know , i know your worthiness .
my lord of westmoreland , and uncle exeter , we will aboard to night .
why , how now , gentlemen !
what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion ?
look ye , how they change !
their cheeks are paper .
why , what read you there that hath so cowarded and chased your blood out of appearance ?
i do confess my fault , and do submit me to your highness ' mercy .
to which we all appeal .
the mercy that was quick in us but late , by your own counsel is suppress and kill you must not dare , for shame , to talk of mercy , for your own reasons turn into your bosoms , as dogs upon their masters , worrying you .
see you , my princes , and my noble peers , these english monsters !
my lord of cambridge here , you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him with all appertinents belonging to his honour , and this man hath , for a few light crowns , lightly conspired , and sworn unto the practises of france , to kill us here in hampton to the which this knight , no less for bounty bound to us than cambridge is , hath likewise sworn .
but , o , what shall i say to thee , lord scroop ?
thou cruel , ingrateful , savage and inhuman creature !
thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels , that the very bottom of my soul , that almost mightst have coin me into gold , wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use , may it be possible , that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger ?
is so strange , that , though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white , my eye will scarcely see it .
treason and murder ever kept together , as two sworn to either purpose , working so grossly in a natural cause , that admiration did not whoop at them but thou , all proportion , didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence all other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches , colours , and with forms being fetch from glistering semblances of piety , but he that temper thee bade thee stand up , gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason , unless to dub thee with the name of traitor .
if that same demon that hath gull thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world , he might return to vasty tartar back , and tell the legions ' i can never win a soul so easy as that englishman . '
o , how hast thou with infected the sweetness of affiance !
show men dutiful ?
why , so didst thou seem they grave and learned ?
why , so didst thou come they of noble family ?
why , so didst thou seem they religious ?
why , so didst thou or are they spare in diet , free from gross passion or of mirth or anger , constant in spirit , not swerving with the blood , garnish and deck in modest complement , not working with the eye without the ear , and but in purged judgment trusting neither ?
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot , to mark the man and best indued with some suspicion .
i will weep for thee , for this revolt of thine , methinks , is like another fall of man .
their faults are open arrest them to the answer of the law , and god acquit them of their practises !
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of richard earl of cambridge .
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of henry lord scroop of masham .
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of thomas grey , knight , of northumberland .
our purposes god justly hath discover , and i repent my fault more than my death , which i beseech your highness to forgive , although my body pay the price of it .
for me , the gold of france did not seduce , although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended but god be thanked for prevention , which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice , beseeching god and you to pardon me .
never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy myself .
prevented from a damned enterprise my fault , but not my body , pardon , sovereign .
god quit you in his mercy !
hear your sentence .
you have conspired against our royal person , join with an enemy proclaim and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death , wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter , his princes and his peers to servitude , his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation .
touching our person seek we no revenge , but we our kingdom safety must so tender , whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws we do deliver you .
get you therefore hence , poor miserable wretches , to your death the taste whereof , god of his mercy give you patience to endure , and true repentance of all your dear offences !
bear them hence .
exeunt cambridge , scroop and grey , guarded now , lords , for france , the enterprise whereof shall be to you , as us , like glorious .
we doubt not of a fair and lucky war , since god so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way to hinder our beginnings .
we doubt not now but every rub is smoothed on our way .
then forth , dear countrymen let us deliver our puissance into the hand of god , putting it straight in expedition .
cheerly to sea , the signs of war advance no king of england , if not king of france .

nay , sure , he not in hell he in arthur bosom , if ever man went to arthur bosom .
a ' made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child , a ' parted even just between twelve and one , even at the turning o ' the tide for after i saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers ' ends , i knew there was but one way , for his nose was as sharp as a pen , and a ' babbled of green fields .
now , sir john ! '
quoth i , man !
be o ' good cheer . '
so a ' cried out , god , god ! '
three or four times .
now i , to comfort him , bid him a ' should not think of god , i hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet .
so a ' bade me lay more clothes on his feet i put my hand into the bed and felt them , and they were as cold as any stone , then i felt to his knees , and they were as cold as any stone , and so upward and upward , and all was as cold as any stone .
they say he cried out of sack .
ay , that a ' did .
and of women .
nay , that a ' did not .
yes , that a ' did , and said they were devils incarnate .
a ' could never abide carnation , was a colour he never liked .
a ' said once , the devil would have him about women .
a ' did in some sort , indeed , handle women , but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the whore of babylon .
do you not remember , a ' saw a flea stick upon bardolph nose , and a ' said it was a black soul burning in ?
well , the fuel is gone that maintained that fire that all the riches i got in his service .
shall we shog ?
the king will be gone from southampton .
come , let away .
my love , give me thy lips .
look to my chattels and my movables let senses rule , the word is and pay ' trust none , for oaths are straws , men faiths are , and is the only dog , my duck therefore , caveto be thy counsellor .

the king palace .
flourish .
enter the french king , the dauphin , the dukes of berri and bretagne , the constable , and others thus comes the english with full power upon us , and more than carefully it us concerns to answer royally in our defences .
therefore the dukes of berri and of bretagne , of brabant and of orleans , shall make forth , and you , prince dauphin , with all swift dispatch , to line and new repair our towns of war with men of courage and with means defendant , for england his approaches makes as fierce as waters to the sucking of a gulf .
it fits us then to be as provident as fear may teach us out of late examples left by the fatal and neglected english upon our fields .
my most redoubted father , it is most meet we arm us the foe , for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom , though war nor no known quarrel were in question , but that defences , musters , preparations , should be maintain , assembled and collected , as were a war in expectation .
therefore , i say is meet we all go forth to view the sick and feeble parts of france and let us do it with no show of fear , no , with no more than if we heard that england were busied with a whitsun for , my good liege , she is so idly king , her sceptre so fantastically borne by a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , that fear attends her not .
o peace , prince dauphin !
you are too much mistaken in this king question your grace the late ambassadors , with what great state he heard their embassy , how well supplied with noble counsellors , how modest in exception , and withal how terrible in constant resolution , and you shall find his vanities forespent were but the outside of the roman brutus , covering discretion with a coat of folly , as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots that shall first spring and be most delicate .
well , is not so , my lord high constable , but though we think it so , it is no matter in cases of defence is best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems so the proportions of defence are fill , which of a weak or niggardly projection doth , like a miser , spoil his coat with scanting a little cloth .
think we king harry strong , and , princes , look you strongly arm to meet him .
the kindred of him hath been flesh upon us , and he is bred out of that bloody strain that haunted us in our familiar paths witness our too much memorable shame when cressy battle fatally was struck , and all our princes captiv by the hand of that black name , edward , black prince of wales , whiles that his mountain sire , on mountain standing , up in the air , crown with the golden sun , saw his heroical seed , and smiled to see him , mangle the work of nature and deface the patterns that by god and by french fathers had twenty years been made .
this is a stem of that victorious stock , and let us fear the native mightiness and fate of him .
enter a messenger ambassadors from harry king of england do crave admittance to your majesty .
we give them present audience .
go , and bring them .
exeunt messenger and certain lords you see this chase is hotly follow , friends .
turn head , and stop pursuit , for coward dogs most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten runs far before them .
good my sovereign , take up the english short , and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head , my liege , is not so vile a sin as .
lords , with exeter and train from our brother england ?
from him , and thus he greets your majesty .
he wills you , in the name of god almighty , that you divest yourself , and lay apart the borrow glories that by gift of heaven , by law of nature and of nations , to him and to his heirs , namely , the crown and all honours that pertain by custom and the ordinance of times unto the crown of france .
that you may know is no sinister nor no awkward claim , pick from the of days , nor from the dust of old oblivion raked , he sends you this most memorable line , in every branch truly demonstrative , willing to overlook this pedigree and when you find him evenly derived from his most famed of famous ancestors , edward the third , he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom , indirectly held from him the native and true challenger .
or else what follows ?
bloody constraint , for if you hide the crown even in your hearts , there will he rake for it therefore in fierce tempest is he coming , in thunder and in earthquake , like a jove , that , if requiring fail , he will compel , and bids you , in the bowels of the lord , deliver up the crown , and to take mercy on the poor souls for whom this hungry war opens his vasty jaws , and on your head turning the widows ' tears , the orphans ' cries the dead men blood , the pining maidens groans , for husbands , fathers and betrothed lovers , that shall be swallow in this controversy .
this is his claim , his threatening and my message , unless the dauphin be in presence here , to whom expressly i bring greeting too .
for us , we will consider of this further shall you bear our full intent back to our brother england .
for the dauphin , i stand here for him what to him from england ?
scorn and defiance , slight regard , contempt , and any thing that may not misbecome the mighty sender , doth he prize you at .
thus says my king , an ' if your father highness do not , in grant of all demands at large , sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty , he call you to so hot an answer of it , that caves and womby vaultages of france shall chide your trespass and return your mock in second accent of his ordnance .
say , if my father render fair return , it is against my will , for i desire nothing but odds with england to that end , as matching to his youth and vanity , i did present him with the paris balls .
he make your paris louvre shake for it , were it the of mighty europe and , be assured , you find a difference , as we his subjects have in wonder found , between the promise of his greener days and these he masters now now he weighs time even to the utmost grain that you shall read in your own losses , if he stay in france .
shall you know our mind at full .
dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king come here himself to question our delay , for he is footed in this land already .
you shall be soon dispatch with fair conditions a night is but small breath and little pause to answer matters of this consequence .

exeunt act iii prologue enter chorus thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies in motion of no less celerity than that of thought .
suppose that you have seen the king at hampton pier embark his royalty , and his brave fleet with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning play with your fancies , and in them behold upon the hempen tackle climbing , hear the shrill whistle which doth order give to sounds confused , behold the threaden sails , borne with the invisible and creeping wind , draw the huge bottoms through the furrow sea , breasting the lofty surge o , do but think you stand upon the ravage and behold a city on the inconstant billows dancing , for so appears this fleet majestical , holding due course to harfleur .
follow , follow grapple your minds to sternage of this navy , and leave your england , as dead midnight still , guarded with grandsires , babies and old women , either past or not arrived to pith and puissance , for who is he , whose chin is but enrich with one appearing hair , that will not follow these cull and cavaliers to france ?
work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege , behold the ordnance on their carriages , with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur .
suppose the ambassador from the french comes back , tells harry that the king doth offer him katharine his daughter , and with her , to dowry , some petty and unprofitable dukedoms .
the offer likes not and the nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches , alarum , and chambers go off and down goes all before them .

in peace there nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears , then imitate the action of the tiger , stiffen the sinews , summon up the blood , disguise fair nature with rage , then lend the eye a terrible aspect , let pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon , let the brow it as fearfully as doth a galled rock and jutty his confounded base , swill with the wild and wasteful ocean .
now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide , hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height .
on , on , you noblest english .
whose blood is fet from fathers of !
fathers that , like so many alexanders , have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument dishonour not your mothers , now attest that those whom you call fathers did beget you .
be copy now to men of grosser blood , and teach them how to war .
and you , good yeoman , whose limbs were made in england , show us here the mettle of your pasture , let us swear that you are worth your breeding , which i doubt not , for there is none of you so mean and base , that hath not noble lustre in your eyes .
i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips , straining upon the start .

to the breach , to the breach !
pray thee , corporal , stay the knocks are too hot , and , for mine own part , i have not a case of lives the humour of it is too hot , that is the very of it .
the is most just for humours do abound knocks go and come , god vassals drop and die , and sword and shield , in bloody field , doth win immortal fame .
would i were in an alehouse in london !
i would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety .
and i if wishes would prevail with me , my purpose should not fail with me , but thither would i hie .
as duly , but not as truly , as bird doth sing on bough .
enter fluellen up to the breach , you dogs !
avaunt , you cullions !
driving them forward be merciful , great duke , to men of mould .
abate thy rage , abate thy manly rage , abate thy rage , great duke !
good bawcock , bate thy rage , use lenity , sweet chuck !
these be good humours !
your honour wins bad humours .
exeunt all but boy as young as i am , i have observed these three swashers .
i am boy to them all three but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me , for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man .
for bardolph , he is and , by the means whereof a ' faces it out , but fights not .
for pistol , he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword , by the means whereof a ' breaks words , and keeps whole weapons .
for nym , he hath heard that men of few words are the best men , and therefore he scorns to say his prayers , lest a ' should be thought a coward but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds , for a ' never broke any man head but his own , and that was against a post when he was drunk .
they will steal any thing , and call it purchase .
bardolph stole a , bore it twelve leagues , and sold it for three half pence .
nym and bardolph are sworn brothers in filching , and in calais they stole a i knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals .
they would have me as familiar with men pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood , if i should take from another pocket to put into mine , for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs .
i must leave them , and seek some better service their villany goes against my weak stomach , and therefore i must cast it up .
exit fluellen , gower following captain fluellen , you must come presently to the mines , the duke of gloucester would speak with you .
to the mines !
tell you the duke , it is not so good to come to the mines , for , look you , the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war the concavities of it is not sufficient , for , look you , the athversary , you may discuss unto the duke , look you , is digt himself four yard under the countermines by cheshu , i think a ' will plough up all , if there is not better directions .
the duke of gloucester , to whom the order of the siege is given , is altogether directed by an irishman , a very valiant gentleman , i ' faith .
it is captain macmorris , is it not ?
i think it be .
by cheshu , he is an ass , as in the world i will verify as much in his beard be has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars , look you , of the roman disciplines , than is a .
enter macmorris and captain jamy here a ' comes , and the scots captain , captain jamy , with him .
captain jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman , that is certain , and of great expedition and knowledge in th ' aunchient wars , upon my particular knowledge of his directions by cheshu , he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world , in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the romans .
i say , captain fluellen .
to your worship , good captain james .
how now , captain macmorris !
have you quit the mines ?
have the pioneers given ?
by chrish , la !
tish ill done the work ish give over , the trompet sound the retreat .
by my hand , i swear , and my father soul , the work ish ill done , it ish give over i would have blowed up the town , so chrish save me , la !
in an hour o , tish ill done , tish ill done , by my hand , tish ill done !
captain macmorris , i beseech you now , will you voutsafe me , look you , a few disputations with you , as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war , the roman wars , in the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication , partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline , that is the point .
it sall be vary gud , gud feith , gud captains bath and i sall quit you with gud leve , as i may pick occasion , that sall i , marry .
it is no time to discourse , so chrish save me the day is hot , and the weather , and the wars , and the king , and the dukes it is no time to discourse .
the town is beseeched , and the trumpet call us to the breach , and we talk , and , be chrish , do nothing is shame for us all so god sa ' me , is shame to stand still , it is shame , by my hand and there is throats to be cut , and works to be done , and there ish nothing done , so chrish sa ' me , la !
by the mess , ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber , ay de gud service , or ay lig i ' the grund for it , ay , or go to death , and ay pay as valourously as i may , that sall i suerly do , that is the breff and the long .
marry , i wad full fain hear some question you tway .
captain macmorris , i think , look you , under your correction , there is not many of your nation of my nation !
what ish my nation ?
ish a villain , and a bastard , and a knave , and a rascal .
what ish my nation ?
who talks of my nation ?
look you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , captain macmorris , peradventure i shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me , look you being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of war , and in the derivation of my birth , and in other particularities .
i do not know you so good a man as myself so chrish save me , i will cut off your head .
gentlemen both , you will mistake each other .
a !
that a foul fault .
a parley sounded the town sounds a parley .
captain macmorris , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , i will be so bold as to tell you i know the disciplines of war , and there is an end .

enter king henry and his train how yet resolves the governor of the town ?
this is the latest parle we will admit , therefore to our best mercy give yourselves , or like to men proud of destruction defy us to our worst for , as i am a soldier , a name that in my thoughts becomes me best , if i begin the battery once again , i will not leave the harfleur till in her ashes she lie buried .
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up , and the flesh soldier , rough and hard of heart , in liberty of bloody hand shall range with conscience wide as hell , mowing like grass your virgins and your flowering infants .
what is it then to me , if impious war , array in flames like to the prince of fiends , do , with his smirch complexion , all fell feats enlink to waste and desolation ?
what to me , when you yourselves are cause , if your pure maidens fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation ?
what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career ?
we may as bootless spend our vain command upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the leviathan to come ashore .
therefore , you men of harfleur , take pity of your town and of your people , whiles yet my soldiers are in my command , whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace the filthy and contagious clouds of heady murder , spoil and villany .
if not , why , in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand defile the locks of your daughters , your fathers taken by the silver beards , and their most reverend heads dash to the walls , your naked infants spitted upon pikes , whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused do break the clouds , as did the wives of jewry at herod slaughtermen .
what say you ?
will you yield , and this avoid , or , guilty in defence , be thus destroy ?
our expectation hath this day an end the dauphin , whom of succors we entreated , returns us that his powers are yet not ready to raise so great a siege .
therefore , great king , we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy .
enter our gates , dispose of us and ours , for we no longer are defensible .
open your gates .
come , uncle exeter , go you and enter harfleur , there remain , and fortify it strongly the french use mercy to them all .
for us , dear uncle , the winter coming on and sickness growing upon our soldiers , we will retire to calais .

and if he be not fought withal , my lord , let us not live in france , let us quit all and give our vineyards to a barbarous people .
o dieu vivant !
shall a few sprays of us , the emptying of our fathers ' luxury , our scions , put in wild and savage stock , spirt up so suddenly into the clouds , and overlook their grafters ?
normans , but bastard normans , norman bastards !
mort de ma vie !
if they march along unfought withal , but i will sell my dukedom , to buy a slobbery and a dirty farm in that isle of albion .
dieu de batailles !
where have they this mettle ?
is not their climate foggy , raw and dull , on whom , as in despite , the sun looks pale , killing their fruit with frowns ?
can sodden water , a drench for jades , their , decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat ?
and shall our quick blood , spirited with wine , seem frosty ?
o , for honour of our land , let us not hang like roping icicles upon our houses ' thatch , whiles a more frosty people sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields !
poor we may call them in their native lords .
by faith and honour , our madams mock at us , and plainly say our mettle is bred out and they will give their bodies to the lust of english youth to france with bastard warriors .
they bid us to the english , and teach lavoltas high and swift corantos , saying our grace is only in our heels , and that we are most lofty runaways .
where is montjoy the herald ?
speed him hence let him greet england with our sharp defiance .
up , princes !
and , with spirit of honour edged more sharper than your swords , hie to the field charles delabreth , high constable of france , you dukes of orleans , bourbon , and of berri , alencon , brabant , bar , and burgundy , jaques chatillon , rambures , vaudemont , beaumont , grandpre , roussi , and fauconberg , foix , lestrale , bouciqualt , and charolois , high dukes , great princes , barons , lords and knights , for your great seats now quit you of great shames .
bar harry england , that sweeps through our land with pennons painted in the blood of harfleur rush on his host , as doth the melted snow upon the valleys , whose low vassal seat the alps doth spit and void his rheum upon go down upon him , you have power enough , and in a captive chariot into rouen bring him our prisoner .
this becomes the great .
sorry am i his numbers are so few , his soldiers sick and famish in their march , for i am sure , when he shall see our army , he drop his heart into the sink of fear and for achievement offer us his ransom .
therefore , lord constable , haste on montjoy .
and let him say to england that we send to know what willing ransom he will give .
prince dauphin , you shall stay with us in rouen .
not so , i do beseech your majesty .
be patient , for you shall remain with us .

exeunt scene vi .
the english camp in picardy .
enter gower and fluellen , meeting how now , captain fluellen !
come you from the bridge ?
i assure you , there is very excellent services committed at the bridge .
is the duke of exeter safe ?
the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon , and a man that i love and honour with my soul , and my heart , and my duty , and my life , and my living , and my uttermost power he is be praised and blessed ! any hurt in the world , but keeps the bridge most valiantly , with excellent discipline .
there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge , i think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as mark antony , and he is a man of no estimation in the world , but did see him do as gallant service .
what do you call him ?
he is called aunchient pistol .
i know him not .
enter pistol here is the man .
captain , i thee beseech to do me favours the duke of exeter doth love thee well .
ay , i praise god , and i have merited some love at his hands .
bardolph , a soldier , firm and sound of heart , and of buxom valour , hath , by cruel fate , and giddy fortune furious fickle wheel , that goddess blind , that stands upon the rolling restless stone by your patience , aunchient pistol .
fortune is painted blind , with a muffler afore her eyes , to signify to you that fortune is blind , and she is painted also with a wheel , to signify to you , which is the moral of it , that she is turning , and inconstant , and mutability , and variation and her foot , look you , is fixed upon a spherical stone , which rolls , and rolls , and rolls in good truth , the poet makes a most excellent description of it fortune is an excellent moral .
fortune is bardolph foe , and frowns on him , for he hath stolen a pax , and hanged must a ' be a damned death !
let gallows gape for dog , let man go free and let not hemp his suffocate but exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little price .
therefore , go speak the duke will hear thy voice and let not bardolph vital thread be cut with edge of penny cord and vile reproach speak , captain , for his life , and i will thee requite .
aunchient pistol , i do partly understand your meaning .
why then , rejoice therefore .
certainly , aunchient , it is not a thing to rejoice at for if , look you , he were my brother , i would desire the duke to use his good pleasure , and put him to execution , for discipline ought to be used .
die and be damn !
and figo for thy friendship !
it is well .
the fig of spain !
exit very good .
why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal , i remember him now , a bawd , a cutpurse .
i assure you , a ' uttered as brave words at the bridge as you shall see in a summer day .
but it is very well , what he has spoke to me , that is well , i warrant you , when time is serve .
why , is a gull , a fool , a rogue , that now and then goes to the wars , to grace himself at his return into london under the form of a soldier .
and such fellows are perfect in the great commanders ' names and they will learn you by rote where services were done , at such and such a sconce , at such a breach , at such a convoy , who came off bravely , who was shot , who disgraced , what terms the enemy stood on , and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war , which they trick up with oaths and what a beard of the general cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and wits , is wonderful to be thought on .
but you must learn to know such slanders of the age , or else you may be marvellously mistook .
i tell you what , captain gower , i do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if i find a hole in his coat , i will tell him my mind .
drum heard hark you , the king is coming , and i must speak with him from the pridge .
drum and colours .
enter king henry , gloucester , and soldiers god pless your majesty !
how now , fluellen !
camest thou from the bridge ?
ay , so please your majesty .
the duke of exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge the french is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages , marry , th ' athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the duke of exeter is master of the pridge i can tell your majesty , the duke is a prave man .
what men have you lost , fluellen ?
the perdition of th ' athversary hath been very great , reasonable great marry , for my part , i think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one bardolph , if your majesty know the man his face is all bubukles , and whelks , and knobs , and flames o ' fire and his lips blows at his nose , and it is like a coal of fire , sometimes plue and sometimes red , but his nose is executed and his fire out .
we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge , that in our marches through the country , there be nothing compelled from the villages , nothing taken but paid for , none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language , for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner .
tucket .
enter montjoy you know me by my habit .
well then i know thee what shall i know of thee ?
my master mind .
unfold it .
thus says my king say thou to harry of england though we seemed dead , we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness .
tell him we could have rebuked him at harfleur , but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe now we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial england shall repent his folly , see his weakness , and admire our sufferance .
bid him therefore consider of his ransom , which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested , which in weight to , his pettiness would bow under .
for our losses , his exchequer is too poor , for the effusion of our blood , the muster of his kingdom too faint a number , and for our disgrace , his own person , kneeling at our feet , but a weak and worthless satisfaction .
to this add defiance and tell him , for conclusion , he hath betrayed his followers , whose condemnation is pronounced .
so far my king and master , so much my office .
what is thy name ?
i know thy quality .
montjoy .
thou dost thy office fairly .
turn thee back .
and tell thy king i do not seek him now , but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for , to say the sooth , though is no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage , my people are with sickness much enfeebled , my numbers lessened , and those few i have almost no better than so many french , who when they were in health , i tell thee , herald , i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen .
yet , forgive me , god , that i do brag thus !
this your air of france hath blown that vice in me i must repent .
go therefore , tell thy master here i am , my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk , my army but a weak and sickly guard , yet , god before , tell him we will come on , though france himself and such another neighbour stand in our way .
there for thy labour , montjoy .
go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass , we will , if we be hinder , we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolour and so montjoy , fare you well .
the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle , as we are , nor , as we are , we say we will not shun it so tell your master .
i shall deliver so .
thanks to your highness .
exit i hope they will not come upon us now .
we are in god hand , brother , not in theirs .
march to the bridge , it now draws toward night beyond the river we encamp ourselves , and on , bid them march away .
exeunt scene vii .
the french camp , near agincourt enter the constable of france , the lord rambures , orleans , dauphin , with others tut !
i have the best armour of the world .
would it were day !
you have an excellent armour , but let my horse have his due .
it is the best horse of europe .
will it never be morning ?
my lord of orleans , and my lord high constable , you talk of horse and armour ?
you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .
what a long night is this !
i will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns .
ca , ha !
he bounds from the earth , as if his entrails were hairs , le cheval volant , the pegasus , chez les narines de feu !
when i bestride him , i soar , i am a hawk he trots the air , the earth sings when he touches it , the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes .
he of the colour of the nutmeg .
and of the heat of the ginger .
it is a beast for perseus he is pure air and fire , and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him , but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him he is indeed a horse , and all other jades you may call beasts .
indeed , my lord , it is a most absolute and excellent horse .
it is the prince of palfreys , his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage .
no more , cousin .
nay , the man hath no wit that can not , from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb , vary deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues , and my horse is argument for them all is a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign sovereign to ride on , and for the world , familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him .
i once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus of nature , ' i have heard a sonnet begin so to one mistress .
then did they imitate that which i composed to my courser , for my horse is my mistress .
your mistress bears well .
me well , which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress .
nay , for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back .
so perhaps did yours .
mine was not bridled .
o then belike she was old and gentle , and you rode , like a kern of ireland , your french hose off , and in your straight strossers .
you have good judgment in horsemanship .
be warned by me , then they that ride so and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs .
i had rather have my horse to my mistress .
i had as lief have my mistress a jade .
i tell thee , constable , my mistress wears his own hair .
i could make as true a boast as that , if i had a sow to my mistress .
chien est retourne a son propre vomissement , et la truie lavee au bourbier , ' thou makest use of any thing .
yet do i not use my horse for my mistress , or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose .
my lord constable , the armour that i saw in your tent , are those stars or suns upon it ?
stars , my lord .
some of them will fall , i hope .
and yet my sky shall not want .
that may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and more honour some were away .
even as your horse bears your praises , who would trot as well , were some of your brags dismounted .
would i were able to load him with his desert !
will it never be day ?
i will trot a mile , and my way shall be paved with english faces .
i will not say so , for fear i should be faced out of my way but i would it were morning , for i would fain be about the ears of the english .
who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners ?
you must first go yourself to hazard , ere you have them .
is midnight , i go arm myself .
exit the dauphin longs for morning .
he longs to eat the english .
i think he will eat all he kills .
by the white hand of my lady , he a gallant prince .
swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
he is simply the most active gentleman of france .
doing is activity , and he will still be doing .
he never did harm , that i heard of .
nor will do none he will keep that good name still .
i know him to be valiant .
i was told that by one that knows him better than you .
what he ?
marry , he told me so himself , and he said he cared not who knew it he needs not , it is no hidden virtue in him .
by my faith , sir , but it is , never any body saw it but his lackey is a hooded valour , and when it appears , it will bate .
ill will never said well .
i will cap that proverb with is flattery in friendship . '
and i will take up that with the devil his due . '
well placed there stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with ' a pox of the devil . '
you are the better at proverbs , by how much ' a fool bolt is soon shot . '
you have shot over .
is not the first time you were overshot .
enter a messenger my lord high constable , the english lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
who hath measured the ground ?
the lord grandpre .
a valiant and most expert gentleman .
would it were day !
alas , poor harry of england !
he longs not for the dawning as we do .
what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of england , to mope with his followers so far out of his knowledge !
if the english had any apprehension , they would run away .
that they lack , for if their heads had any intellectual armour , they could never wear such heavy .
that island of england breeds very valiant creatures , their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .
foolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples !
you may as well say , that a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion .
just , just , and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on , leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel , they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
ay , but these english are shrewdly out of beef .
then shall we find they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight .
now is it time to arm come , shall we about it ?
it is now two but , let me see , by ten we shall have each a hundred englishmen .
exeunt act iv prologue enter chorus now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe .
from camp to camp through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds , that the fixed sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each other watch fire answers fire , and through their paly flames each battle sees the other umber face , steed threatens steed , in high and boastful neighs piercing the night dull ear , and from the tents the armourers , accomplishing the knights , with busy hammers closing rivets up , give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow , the clocks do toll , and the third hour of drowsy morning name .
proud of their numbers and secure in soul , the confident and french do the english play at dice , and chide the cripple night who , like a foul and ugly witch , doth limp so tediously away .
the poor condemned english , like sacrifices , by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the morning danger , and their gesture sad investing , cheeks and coats presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts .
o now , who will behold the royal captain of this ruin band walking from watch to watch , from tent to tent , let him cry and glory on his head ! '
for forth he goes and visits all his host .
bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers , friends and countrymen .
upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him , nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour unto the weary and night , but freshly looks and attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty , that every wretch , pining and pale before , beholding him , plucks comfort from his looks a largess universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to every one , thawing cold fear , that mean and gentle all , behold , as may unworthiness define , a little touch of harry in the night .
and so our scene must to the battle fly , where o for pity ! we shall much disgrace with four or five most vile and ragged foils , right in brawl ridiculous , the name of agincourt .
yet sit and see , minding true things by what their mockeries be .
exit scene i .
the english camp at agincourt .
enter king henry , bedford , and gloucester gloucester , is true that we are in great danger , the greater therefore should our courage be .
good morrow , brother bedford .
god almighty !
there is some soul of goodness in things evil , would men observingly distil it out .
for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers , which is both healthful and good husbandry besides , they are our outward consciences , and preachers to us all , admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end .
thus may we gather honey from the weed , and make a moral of the devil himself .
enter erpingham good morrow , old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france .
not so , my liege this lodging likes me better , since i may say lie i like a king . '
is good for men to love their present pains upon example , so the spirit is eased and when the mind is quicken , out of doubt , the organs , though defunct and dead before , break up their drowsy grave and newly move , with casted slough and fresh legerity .
lend me thy cloak , sir thomas .
brothers both , commend me to the princes in our camp , do my good morrow to them , and anon desire them an to my pavilion .
we shall , my liege .
shall i attend your grace ?
no , my good knight , go with my brothers to my lords of england i and my bosom must debate awhile , and then i would no other company .
the lord in heaven bless thee , noble harry !
exeunt all but king henry , old heart !

enter pistol qui va la ?

discuss unto me , art thou officer ?
or art thou base , common and popular ?
i am a gentleman of a company .
thou the puissant pike ?
even so .
what are you ?
as good a gentleman as the emperor .
then you are a better than the king .
the king a bawcock , and a heart of gold , a lad of life , an imp of fame , of parents good , of fist most valiant .
i kiss his dirty shoe , and from i love the lovely bully .
what is thy name ?
harry le roy .
le roy !
a cornish name art thou of cornish crew ?
no , i am a welshman .
thou fluellen ?
yes .
tell him , i knock his leek about his pate upon saint davy day .
do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .
art thou his friend ?
and his kinsman too .
the figo for thee , then !
i thank you god be with you !
my name is pistol call .
exit it sorts well with your fierceness .
enter fluellen and gower captain fluellen !
so !
in the name of jesu christ , speak lower .
it is the greatest admiration of the universal world , when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of pompey the great , you shall find , i warrant you , that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble pabble in pompey camp , i warrant you , you shall find the ceremonies of the wars , and the cares of it , and the forms of it , and the sobriety of it , and the modesty of it , to be otherwise .
why , the enemy is loud , you hear him all night .
if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb ?
in your own conscience , now ?
i will speak lower .
i pray you and beseech you that you will .
exeunt gower and fluellen though it appear a little out of fashion , there is much care and valour in this welshman .
enter three soldiers , john bates , alexander court , and michael williams brother john bates , is not that the morning which breaks yonder ?
i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day .
we see yonder the beginning of the day , but i think we shall never see the end of it .
who goes there ?
a friend .
under what captain serve you ?
under sir thomas erpingham .
a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?
even as men wrecked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .
he hath not told his thought to the king ?
no , nor it is not meet he should .
for , though i speak it to you , i think the king is but a man , as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me , all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man , and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet , when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing .
therefore when he sees reason of fears , as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are yet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army .
he may show what outward courage he will , but i believe , as cold a night as is , he could wish himself in thames up to the neck , and so i would he were , and i by him , at all adventures , so we were quit here .
by my troth , i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself any where but where he is .
then i would he were here alone , so should he be sure to be ransomed , and a many poor men lives saved .
i dare say you love him not so ill , to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men minds methinks i could not die any where so contented as in the king company , his cause being just and his quarrel honourable .
that more than we know .
ay , or more than we should seek after , for we know enough , if we know we are the kings subjects if his cause be wrong , our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us .
but if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in battle , shall join together at the latter day and cry all died at such a place , ' some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left .
i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle , for how can they charitably dispose of any thing , when blood is their argument ?
now , if these men do not die well , it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it , whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection .
so , if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea , the imputation of his wickedness by your rule , should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant , under his master command transporting a sum of money , be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities , you may call the business of the master the author of the servant damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant , for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services .
besides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrement of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder , some , of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury , some , making the wars their bulwark , that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery .
now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle , war is vengeance , so that here men are punished for of the king laws in now the king quarrel where they feared the death , they have borne life away , and where they would be safe , they perish then if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited .
every subject duty is the king , but every subject soul is his own .
therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed , wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so , death is to him advantage , or not dying , the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes , it were not sin to think that , making god so free an offer , he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare .
is certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head , the king is not to answer it .
but i do not desire he should answer for me , and yet i determine to fight lustily for him .
i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
ay , he said so , to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut , he may be ransomed , and we the wiser .
if i live to see it , i will never trust his word after .
you pay him then .
that a perilous shot out of an , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch !
you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock feather .
you never trust his word after !
come , is a foolish saying .
your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you , if the time were convenient .
let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
i embrace it .
how shall i know thee again ?
give me any gage of thine , and i will wear it in my bonnet then , if ever thou darest acknowledge it , i will make it my quarrel .
here my glove give me another of thine .
there .
this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say , after , is my glove , ' by this hand , i will take thee a box on the ear .
if ever i live to see it , i will challenge it .
thou darest as well be hanged .
well .
i will do it , though i take thee in the king company .
keep thy word fare thee well .
be friends , you english fools , be friends we have french quarrels enow , if you could tell how to reckon .
indeed , the french may lay twenty french crowns to one , they will beat us , for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns , and the king himself will be a clipper .
exeunt soldiers upon the king !
let us our lives , our souls , our debts , our careful wives , our children and our sins lay on the king !
we must bear all .
o hard condition , with greatness , subject to the breath of every fool , whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing !
what infinite must kings neglect , that private men enjoy !
and what have kings , that privates have not too , save ceremony , save general ceremony ?
and what art thou , thou idle ceremony ?
what kind of god art thou , that more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?
what are thy rents ?
what are thy comings in ?
o ceremony , show me but thy worth !
what is thy soul of adoration ?
art thou aught else but place , degree and form , creating awe and fear in other men ?
wherein thou art less happy being fear than they in fearing .
what thou oft , instead of homage sweet , but poison flattery ?
o , be sick , great greatness , and bid thy ceremony give thee cure !
thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation ?
will it give place to flexure and low bending ?
canst thou , when thou the beggar knee , command the health of it ?
no , thou proud dream , that so subtly with a king repose , i am a king that find thee , and i know is not the balm , the sceptre and the ball , the sword , the mace , the crown imperial , the intertissued robe of gold and pearl , the farced title running the king , the throne he sits on , nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world , no , not all these , ceremony , not all these , laid in bed majestical , can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave , who with a body fill and vacant mind gets him to rest , cramm with distressful bread , never sees horrid night , the child of hell , but , like a lackey , from the rise to set sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night sleeps in elysium , next day after dawn , doth rise and help hyperion to his horse , and follows so the year , with profitable labour , to his grave and , but for ceremony , such a wretch , winding up days with toil and nights with sleep , had the and vantage of a king .
the slave , a member of the country peace , enjoys it , but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace , whose hours the peasant best advantages .
enter erpingham my lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence , seek through your camp to find you .
good old knight , collect them all together at my tent i be before thee .
i shall , my lord .
exit o god of battles !
steel my soldiers ' hearts , possess them not with fear , take from them now the sense of reckoning , if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them .
not , o lord , o , not , think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown !
i richard body have interred anew , and on it have bestow more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood five hundred poor i have in yearly pay , who twice their wither hands hold up toward heaven , to pardon blood , and i have built two chantries , where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richard soul .
more will i do , though all that i can do is nothing worth , since that my penitence comes after all , imploring pardon .
enter gloucester my liege !
my brother gloucester voice ?
ay , i know thy errand , i will go with thee the day , my friends and all things stay for me .
exeunt scene ii .

varlet !
laquais !
ha !
o brave spirit !
via !
les eaux et la terre .
rien puis ?
et la feu .
ciel , cousin orleans .
enter constable now , my lord constable !
hark , how our steeds for present service neigh !
mount them , and make incision in their hides , that their hot blood may spin in english eyes , and dout them with superfluous courage , ha !
what , will you have them weep our horses ' blood ?
how shall we , then , behold their natural tears ?
enter messenger the english are embattled , you french peers .
to horse , you gallant princes !
straight to horse !
do but behold yon poor and starved band , and your fair show shall suck away their souls , leaving them but the shales and husks of men .
there is not work enough for all our hands , scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins to give each naked a stain , that our french gallants shall draw out , and sheathe for lack of sport let us but blow on them , the vapour of our valour will them .
is positive all exceptions , lords , that our superfluous lackeys and our peasants , who in unnecessary action swarm about our squares of battle , were enow to purge this field of such a hilding foe , though we upon this mountain basis by took stand for idle speculation but that our honours must not .
what to say ?
a very little little let us do .
and all is done .
then let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount , for our approach shall so much dare the field that england shall couch down in fear and yield .
enter grandpre why do you stay so long , my lords of france ?
yon island carrions , desperate of their bones , become the morning field their ragged curtains poorly are let loose , and our air shakes them passing scornfully big mars seems bankrupt in their beggar host and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks , with in their hand , and their poor jades lob down their heads , dropping the hides and hips , the gum from their eyes and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit lies foul with chew grass , still and motionless , and their executors , the knavish crows , fly them , all impatient for their hour .
description can not suit itself in words to demonstrate the life of such a battle in life so lifeless as it shows itself .
they have said their prayers , and they stay for death .
shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits and give their fasting horses provender , and after fight with them ?
i stay but for my guidon to the field !
i will the banner from a trumpet take , and use it for my haste .
come , come , away !
the sun is high , and we outwear the day .
exeunt scene iii .
the english camp .
enter gloucester , bedford , exeter , erpingham , with all his host salisbury and westmoreland where is the king ?
the king himself is rode to view their battle .
of fighting men they have full three score thousand .
there five to one , besides , they all are fresh .
god arm strike with us !
is a fearful odds .
god be wi ' you , princes all , i to my charge if we no more meet till we meet in heaven , then , joyfully , my noble lord of bedford , my dear lord gloucester , and my good lord exeter , and my kind kinsman , warriors all , adieu !
farewell , good salisbury , and good luck go with thee !
farewell , kind lord , fight valiantly and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it , for thou art framed of the firm truth of valour .
exit salisbury he is full of valour as of kindness , princely in both .
enter the king o that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in england that do no work !
what he that wishes so ?
my cousin westmoreland ?
no , my fair cousin if we are mark to die , we are enow to do our country loss , and if to live , the fewer men , the greater share of honour .
god will !
i pray thee , wish not one man more .
by jove , i am not covetous for gold , nor care i who doth feed upon my cost , it yearns me not if men my garments wear , such outward things dwell not in my desires but if it be a sin to covet honour , i am the most offending soul alive .
no , faith , my coz , wish not a man from england god peace !
i would not lose so great an honour as one man more , methinks , would share from me for the best hope i have .
o , do not wish one more !
rather proclaim it , westmoreland , through my host , that he which hath no stomach to this fight , let him depart , his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse we would not die in that man company that fears his fellowship to die with us .
this day is called the feast of crispian he that outlives this day , and comes safe home , will stand a when the day is named , and rouse him at the name of crispian .
he that shall live this day , and see old age , will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours , and say is saint crispian ' then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars .
and say wounds i had on crispin day . '
old men forget yet all shall be forgot , but he remember with advantages what feats he did that day then shall our names .
familiar in his mouth as household words harry the king , bedford and exeter , warwick and talbot , salisbury and gloucester , be in their flowing cups freshly remember .
this story shall the good man teach his son , and crispin crispian shall go by , from this day to the ending of the world , but we in it shall be remember , we few , we happy few , we band of brothers , for he that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother , be he so vile , this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now shall think themselves accursed they were not here , and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispin day .
salisbury my sovereign lord , bestow yourself with speed the french are bravely in their battles set , and will with all expedience charge on us .
all things are ready , if our minds be so .
perish the man whose mind is backward now !
thou dost not wish more help from england , coz ?
god will !
my liege , would you and i alone , without more help , could fight this royal battle !

you know your places god be with you all !
tucket .
enter montjoy once more i come to know of thee , king harry , if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound , before thy most assured overthrow for certainly thou art so near the gulf , thou needs must be englutted .
besides , in mercy , the constable desires thee thou wilt mind thy followers of repentance , that their souls may make a peaceful and a sweet retire from off these fields , where , wretches , their poor bodies must lie and fester .
who hath sent thee now ?
the constable of france .
i pray thee , bear my former answer back bid them achieve me and then sell my bones .
good god !
why should they mock poor fellows thus ?
the man that once did sell the lion skin while the beast lived , was killed with hunting him .
a many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves , upon the which , i trust , shall witness live in brass of this day work and those that leave their valiant bones in france , dying like men , though buried in your dunghills , they shall be famed , for there the sun shall greet them , and draw their honours reeking up to heaven , leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime , the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france .
mark then abounding valour in our english , that being dead , like to the bullet grazing , break out into a second course of mischief , killing in relapse of mortality .
let me speak proudly tell the constable we are but warriors for the , our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch with rainy marching in the painful field , there not a piece of feather in our host good argument , i hope , we will not fly and time hath worn us into slovenry but , by the mass , our hearts are in the trim , and my poor soldiers tell me , yet ere night they be in fresher robes , or they will pluck the gay new coats the french soldiers ' heads and turn them out of service .
if they do this , as , if god please , they shall , my ransom then will soon be levied .
herald , save thou thy labour , come thou no more for ransom , gentle herald they shall have none , i swear , but these my joints , which if they have as i will leave them , shall yield them little , tell the constable .
i shall , king harry .
and so fare thee well thou never shalt hear herald any more .

the duke of york commends him to your majesty .
lives he , good uncle ?
thrice within this hour i saw him down , thrice up again and fighting , from helmet to the spur all blood he was .
in which array , brave soldier , doth he lie , larding the plain , and by his bloody side , to his wounds , the noble earl of suffolk also lies .
suffolk first died and york , all haggled over , comes to him , where in gore he lay insteep , and takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes that bloodily did spawn upon his face , and cries aloud , dear cousin suffolk !
my soul shall thine keep company to heaven , tarry , sweet soul , for mine , then fly abreast , as in this glorious and field we kept together in our chivalry ! '
upon these words i came and cheer him up he smiled me in the face , raught me his hand , and , with a feeble gripe , says my lord , commend my service to me sovereign . '
so did he turn and over suffolk neck he threw his wounded arm and kiss his lips , and so espoused to death , with blood he seal a testament of love .
the pretty and sweet manner of it forced those waters from me which i would have stopp , but i had not so much of man in me , and all my mother came into mine eyes and gave me up to tears .
i blame you not , for , hearing this , i must perforce compound with mistful eyes , or they will issue too .

is certain there not a boy left alive , and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha ' done this slaughter besides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king tent , wherefore the king , most worthily , hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner throat .
o , is a gallant king !
ay , he was porn at monmouth , captain gower .
what call you the town name where alexander the pig was born !
alexander the great .
why , i pray you , is not pig great ?
the pig , or the great , or the mighty , or the huge , or the magnanimous , are all one reckonings , save the phrase is a little variations .
i think alexander the great was born in macedon , his father was called philip of macedon , as i take it .
i think it is in macedon where alexander is porn .
i tell you , captain , if you look in the maps of the , i warrant you sall find , in the comparisons between macedon and monmouth , that the situations , look you , is both alike .
there is a river in macedon , and there is also moreover a river at monmouth it is called wye at monmouth , but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river , but is all one , is alike as my fingers is to my fingers , and there is salmons in both .
if you mark alexander life well , harry of monmouth life is come after it indifferent well , for there is figures in all things .
alexander , god knows , and you know , in his rages , and his furies , and his wraths , and his cholers , and his moods , and his displeasures , and his indignations , and also being a little intoxicates in his prains , did , in his ales and his angers , look you , kill his best friend , cleitus .
our king is not like him in that he never killed any of his friends .
it is not well done , mark you now take the tales out of my mouth , ere it is made and finished .
i speak but in the figures and comparisons of it as alexander killed his friend cleitus , being in his ales and his cups , so also harry monmouth , being in his right wits and his good judgments , turned away the fat knight with the great he was full of jests , and gipes , and knaveries , and mocks , i have forgot his name .

no , great king i come to thee for charitable licence , that we may wander this bloody field to look our dead , and then to bury them , to sort our nobles from our common men .
for many of our princes woe the while ! lie drown and soak in mercenary blood , so do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs in blood of princes , and their wounded steeds fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters , killing them twice .
o , give us leave , great king , to view the field in safety and dispose of their dead bodies !
i tell thee truly , herald , i know not if the day be ours or no , for yet a many of your horsemen peer and gallop the field .
the day is yours .
praised be god , and not our strength , for it !

though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is , as lucifer and belzebub himself , it is necessary , look your grace , that he keep his vow and his oath if he be perjured , see you now , his reputation is as arrant a villain and a jacksauce , as ever his black shoe trod upon god ground and his earth , in my conscience , la !
then keep thy vow , sirrah , when thou meetest the fellow .

now we bear the king toward calais grant him there , there seen , heave him away upon your winged thoughts athwart the sea .
behold , the english beach pales in the flood with men , with wives and boys , whose shouts and claps the deep mouth sea , which like a mighty whiffler the king seems to prepare his way so let him land , and solemnly see him set on to london .
so swift a pace hath thought that even now you may imagine him upon blackheath , where that his lords desire him to have borne his bruised helmet and his bended sword before him through the city he forbids it , being free from vainness and pride , giving full trophy , signal and ostent quite from himself to god .
but now behold , in the quick forge and of thought , how london doth pour out her citizens !
the mayor and all his brethren in best sort , like to the senators of the antique rome , with the plebeians swarming at their heels , go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in as , by a lower but loving likelihood , were now the general of our gracious empress , as in good time he may , from ireland coming , bringing rebellion broached on his sword , how many would the peaceful city quit , to welcome him !
much more , and much more cause , did they this harry .
now in london place him , as yet the lamentation of the french invites the king of england stay at home , the emperor coming in behalf of france , to order peace between them , and omit all the occurrences , whatever chanced , till harry again to france there must we bring him , and myself have play the interim , by remembering you is past .

unto our brother france , and to our sister , health and fair time of day , joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin katharine , and , as a branch and member of this royalty , by whom this great assembly is contrived , we do salute you , duke of burgundy , and , princes french , and peers , health to you all !
right joyous are we to behold your face , most worthy brother england , fairly met so are you , princes english , every one .
so happy be the issue , brother england , of this good day and of this gracious meeting , as we are now glad to behold your eyes , your eyes , which hitherto have borne in them against the french , that met them in their bent , the fatal balls of murdering basilisks the venom of such looks , we fairly hope , have lost their quality , and that this day shall change all griefs and quarrels into love .
to cry amen to that , thus we appear .
you english princes all , i do salute you .
my duty to you both , on equal love , great kings of france and england !
that i have labour , with all my wits , my pains and strong endeavours , to bring your most imperial majesties unto this bar and royal interview , your mightiness on both parts best can witness .
since then my office hath so far prevail that , face to face and royal eye to eye , you have congreeted , let it not disgrace me , if i demand , before this royal view , what rub or what impediment there is , why that the naked , poor and mangled peace , dear nurse of arts and joyful births , should not in this best garden of the world our fertile france , put up her lovely visage ?
alas , she hath from france too long been chased , and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps , corrupting in its own fertility .
her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , unpruned dies , her hedges , like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair , put forth disorder twigs , her fallow leas the darnel , hemlock and rank fumitory doth root upon , while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery , the even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip , burnet and green clover , wanting the scythe , all uncorrected , rank , conceives by idleness and nothing teems but hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burs , losing both beauty and utility .
and as our vineyards , fallows , meads and hedges , defective in their natures , grow to wildness , even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost , or do not learn for want of time , the sciences that should become our country , but grow like savages , as soldiers will that nothing do but meditate on blood , to swearing and stern looks , diffused attire and every thing that seems unnatural .
which to reduce into our former favour you are assembled and my speech entreats that i may know the let , why gentle peace should not expel these inconveniences and bless us with her former qualities .
if , duke of burgundy , you would the peace , whose want gives growth to the imperfections which you have cited , you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands , whose tenors and particular effects you have enscheduled briefly in your hands .
the king hath heard them , to the which as yet there is no answer made .
well then the peace , which you before so urged , lies in his answer .
i have but with a cursorary eye the articles pleaseth your grace to appoint some of your council presently to sit with us once more , with better heed to them , we will suddenly pass our accept and peremptory answer .
brother , we shall .
go , uncle exeter , and brother clarence , and you , brother gloucester , warwick and huntingdon , go with the king , and take with you free power to ratify , augment , or alter , as your wisdoms best shall see advantageable for our dignity , any thing in or out of our demands , and we consign thereto .
will you , fair sister , go with the princes , or stay here with us ?
our gracious brother , i will go with them haply a woman voice may do some good , when articles too nicely urged be stood on .
yet leave our cousin katharine here with us she is our capital demand , comprised within the of our articles .
she hath good leave .
exeunt all except henry , katharine , and alice fair katharine , and most fair , will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady ear and plead his to her gentle heart ?
your majesty shall mock at me , i can not speak your england .
o fair katharine , if you will love me soundly with your french heart , i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue .
do you like me , kate ?
, i can not tell vat is me . '
an angel is like you , kate , and you are like an angel .
que ?
que je suis semblable a les anges ?
oui , vraiment , sauf votre grace , ainsi .
i said so , dear katharine , and i must not blush to affirm it .
o bon dieu !
les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies .
what says she , fair one ?
that the tongues of men are full of deceits ?
oui , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de princess .
the princess is the better englishwoman .
i ' faith , kate , my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am glad thou canst speak no better english , for , if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown .
i know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say ' i love you ' then if you urge me farther than to say you in faith ? '
i wear out my suit .
give me your answer , i ' faith , do and so clap hands and a bargain how say you , lady ?
sauf votre honneur , me understand vell .
marry , if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake , kate , why you undid me for the one , i have neither words nor measure , and for the other , i have no strength in measure , yet a reasonable measure in strength .
if i could win a lady at , or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back , under the correction of bragging be it spoken .
i should quickly leap into a wife .
or if i might buffet for my love , or bound my horse for her favours , i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a , never off .
but , before god , kate , i can not look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence , nor i have no cunning in protestation , only downright oaths , which i never use till urged , nor never break for urging .
if thou canst love a fellow of this temper , kate , whose face is not worth , that never looks in his glass for love of any thing he sees there , let thine eye be thy cook .
i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this , take me if not , to say to thee that i shall die , is true , but for thy love , by the lord , no , yet i love thee too .
and while thou livest , dear kate , take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy , for he perforce must do thee right , because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue , that can rhyme themselves into ladies ' favours , they do always reason themselves out again .
what !
a speaker is but a prater , a rhyme is but a ballad .
a good leg will fall , a straight back will stoop , a black beard will turn white , a curled pate will grow bald , a fair face will wither , a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart , kate , is the sun and the moon , or , rather , the sun , and not the moon , for it shines bright and never changes , but keeps his course truly .
if thou would have such a one , take me , and take me , take a soldier , take a soldier , take a king .
and what sayest thou then to my love ?
speak , my fair , and fairly , i pray thee .
is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france ?
no , it is not possible you should love the enemy of france , kate but , in loving me , you should love the friend of france , for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it , i will have it all mine and , kate , when france is mine and i am yours , then yours is france and you are mine .
i can not tell vat is dat .
no , kate ?
i will tell thee in french , which i am sure will hang upon my tongue like a wife about her husband neck , hardly to be shook off .
je quand sur le possession de france , et quand vous avez le possession de moi , let me see , what then ?
saint denis be my speed ! donc votre est france et vous etes mienne .
it is as easy for me , kate , to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french i shall never move thee in french , unless it be to laugh at me .
sauf votre honneur , le francois que vous parlez , il est meilleur que lequel je parle .
no , faith , not , kate but thy speaking of my tongue , and i thine , most , must needs be granted to be much at one .
but , kate , dost thou understand thus much english , canst thou love me ?
i can not tell .
can any of your neighbours tell , kate ?
i ask them .
come , i know thou lovest me and at night , when you come into your closet , you question this gentlewoman about me , and i know , kate , you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but , good kate , mock me mercifully , the rather , gentle princess , because i love thee cruelly .
if ever thou beest mine , kate , as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt , i get thee with scambling , and thou must therefore needs prove a good shall not thou and i , between saint denis and saint george , compound a boy , half french , half english , that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard ?
shall we not ?
what sayest thou , my fair ?
i do not know dat no , is hereafter to know , but now to promise do but now promise , kate , you will endeavour for your french part of such a boy , and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor .
how answer you , la plus belle katharine du monde , mon tres cher et devin deesse ?
your majestee ave fausse french enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en france .
now , fie upon my false french !
by mine honour , in true english , i love thee , kate by which honour i dare not swear thou lovest me , yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost , notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage .
now , beshrew my father ambition !
he was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside , with an aspect of iron , that , when i come to woo ladies , i fright them .
but , in faith , kate , the elder i wax , the better i shall appear my comfort is , that old age , that ill layer up of beauty , can do no more , spoil upon my face thou hast me , if thou hast me , at the worst , and thou shalt wear me , if thou wear me , better and better and therefore tell me , most fair katharine , will you have me ?
put off your maiden blushes , avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress , take me by the hand , and say of england i am thine ' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal , but i will tell thee aloud is thine , ireland is thine , france is thine , and harry plantagenet is thine , ' who though i speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows .
come , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy english broken , therefore , queen of all , katharine , break thy mind to me in broken english , wilt thou have me ?
dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere .
nay , it will please him well , kate it shall please him , kate .
den it sall also content me .
upon that i kiss your hand , and i call you my queen .
laissez , mon seigneur , laissez , laissez ma foi , je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main de votre seigeurie indigne serviteur , , je vous supplie , mon seigneur .
then i will kiss your lips , kate .
les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant leur noces , il pas la coutume de france .
madam my interpreter , what says she ?
dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of france , i can not tell vat is baiser en anglish .
to kiss .
your majesty entendre bettre que moi .
it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss before they are married , would she say ?
oui , vraiment .
o kate , nice customs curtsy to great kings .
dear kate , you and i can not be confined within the weak list of a country fashion we are the makers of manners , kate , and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all , as i will do yours , for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore , patiently and yielding .
kissing her you have witchcraft in your lips , kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the french council , and they should sooner persuade harry of england than a general petition of monarchs .
here comes your father .
the french king and his queen , burgundy , and other lords god save your majesty !
my royal cousin , teach you our princess english ?
i would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly i love her , and that is good english .
is she not apt ?
our tongue is rough , coz , and my condition is not smooth , so that , having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me , i can not so conjure up the spirit of love in her , that he will appear in his true likeness .
pardon the frankness of my mirth , if i answer you for that .
if you would conjure in her , you must make a circle , if conjure up love in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind .
can you blame her then , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self ?
it were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
yet they do wink and yield , as love is blind and enforces .
they are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .
i will wink on her to consent , my lord , if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids , well summered and warm kept , are like flies at , blind , though they have their eyes , and then they will endure handling , which before would not abide looking on .
this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer , and so i shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .
as love is , my lord , before it loves .
it is so and you may , some of you , thank love for my blindness , who can not see many a fair french city for one fair french maid that stands in my way .
yes , my lord , you see them perspectively , the cities turned into a maid , for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered .
shall kate be my wife ?
so please you .
i am content , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .
we have consented to all terms of reason .
so , my lords of england ?
the king hath granted every article his daughter first , and then in sequel all , according to their firm proposed natures .
only he hath not yet subscribed this where your majesty demands , that the king of france , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your highness in this form and with this addition in french , notre trescher fils henri , roi , heritier de france , and thus in latin , praeclarissimus filius noster henricus , rex angliae , et haeres franciae .
nor this i have not , brother , so denied , but your request shall make me let it pass .
i pray you then , in love and dear alliance , let that one article rank with the rest , and thereupon give me your daughter .
take her , fair son , and from her blood raise up issue to me , that the contending kingdoms of france and england , whose very shores look pale with envy of each other happiness , may cease their hatred , and this dear conjunction plant neighbourhood and accord in their sweet bosoms , that never war advance his bleeding sword england and fair france .
amen !
now , welcome , kate and bear me witness all , that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen .
flourish god , the best maker of all marriages , combine your hearts in one , your realms in one !
as man and wife , being two , are one in love , so be there your kingdoms such a spousal , that never may ill office , or fell jealousy , which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage , thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms , to make divorce of their incorporate league , that english may as french , french englishmen , receive each other .
god speak this amen !
amen !
prepare we for our marriage on which day , my lord of burgundy , we take your oath , and all the peers ' , for surety of our leagues .
then shall i swear to kate , and you to me , and may our oaths well kept and prosperous be !
sennet .
exeunt epilogue enter chorus thus far , with rough and pen , our bending author hath pursued the story , in little room confining mighty men , mangling by starts the full course of their glory .
small time , but in that small most greatly lived this star of england fortune made his sword , by which the world best garden be achieved , and of it left his son imperial lord .
henry the sixth , in infant bands crown king of france and england , did this king succeed , whose state so many had the managing , that they lost france and made his england bleed which oft our stage hath shown , and , for their sake , in your fair minds let this acceptance take .
exit act i prologue i come no more to make you laugh things now , that bear a weighty and a serious brow , sad , high , and working , full of state and woe , such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow , we now present .
those that can pity , here may , if they think it well , let fall a tear , the subject will deserve it .
such as give their money out of hope they may believe , may here find truth too .
those that come to see only a show or two , and so agree the play may pass , if they be still and willing , i undertake may see away their shilling richly in two short hours .
only they that come to hear a merry bawdy play , a noise of targets , or to see a fellow in a long motley coat guarded with yellow , will be deceived , for , gentle hearers , know , to rank our chosen truth with such a show as fool and fight is , beside forfeiting our own brains , and the opinion that we bring , to make that only true we now intend , will leave us never an understanding friend .
therefore , for goodness ' sake , and as you are known the first and happiest hearers of the town , be sad , as we would make ye think ye see the very persons of our noble story as they were living , think you see them great , and follow with the general throng and sweat of thousand friends , then in a moment , see how soon this mightiness meets misery and , if you can be merry then , i say a man may weep upon his .
scene london .
an in the palace .
enter norfolk at one door , at the other , buckingham and abergavenny good morrow , and well met .
how have ye done since last we saw in france ?
i thank your grace , healthful , and ever since a fresh admirer of what i saw there .
an untimely ague stay me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory , those two lights of men , met in the vale of andren .
guynes and arde i was then present , saw them salute on horseback , beheld them , when they lighted , how they clung in their embracement , as they grew together , which had they , what four throned ones could have weigh such a compounded one ?
all the whole time i was my chamber prisoner .
then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say , till this time pomp was single , but now married to one above itself .
each following day became the next day master , till the last made former wonders its .
the french , all clinquant , all in gold , like heathen gods , shone down the english , and , , they made britain india every man that stood show like a mine .
their dwarfish pages were as cherubins , all guilt the madams too , not used to toil , did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them , that their very labour was to them as a painting now this masque was cried incomparable , and the ensuing night made it a fool and beggar .
the two kings , equal in lustre , were now best , now worst , as presence did present them , him in eye , still him in praise and , being present both was said they saw but one , and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure .
when these suns for so they phrase by their heralds challenged the noble spirits to arms , they did perform beyond thought compass , that former fabulous story , being now seen possible enough , got credit , that bevis was believed .
o , you go far .
as i belong to worship and affect in honour honesty , the tract of every thing would by a good discourser lose some life , which action self was tongue to .
all was royal , to the disposing of it nought rebell .
order gave each thing view , the office did distinctly his full function .
who did guide , i mean , who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together , as you guess ?
one , certes , that promises no element in such a business .
i pray you , who , my lord ?
all this was order by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york .
the devil speed him !
no man pie is freed from his ambitious finger .
what had he to do in these fierce vanities ?
i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o ' the beneficial sun and keep it from the earth .
surely , sir , there in him stuff that puts him to these ends , for , being not propp by ancestry , whose grace chalks successors their way , nor call upon for high feats done to the crown , neither allied for eminent assistants , but , , out of his web , he gives us note , the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives for him , which buys a place next to the king .
i can not tell what heaven hath given him , let some graver eye pierce into that , but i can see his pride peep through each part of him whence has he that , if not from hell ?
the devil is a niggard , or has given all before , and he begins a new hell in himself .
why the devil , upon this french going out , took he upon him , without the privity o ' the king , to appoint who should attend on him ?
he makes up the file of all the gentry , for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter , the honourable board of council out , must fetch him in the papers .
i do know kinsmen of mine , three at the least , that have by this so sickened their estates , that never they shall abound as formerly .
o , many have broke their backs with laying manors on for this great journey .
what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue ?
grievingly i think , the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it .
every man , after the hideous storm that follow , was a thing inspired , and , not consulting , broke into a general prophecy , that this tempest , dashing the garment of this peace , aboded the sudden breach o .
which is budded out , for france hath flaw the league , and hath attach our merchants ' goods at bourdeaux .
is it therefore the ambassador is silenced ?
marry , .
a proper title of a peace , and purchased at a superfluous rate !
why , all this business our reverend cardinal carried .
like it your grace , the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal .
i advise you and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safety that you read the cardinal malice and his potency together , to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power .
you know his nature , that he revengeful , and i know his sword hath a sharp edge it long and , may be said , it reaches far , and where not extend , thither he darts it .
bosom up my counsel , you find it wholesome .
lo , where comes that rock that i advise your shunning .
enter cardinal wolsey , the purse borne before him , certain of the guard , and two secretaries with papers .
cardinal wolsey in his passage fixeth his eye on buckingham , and buckingham on him , both full of disdain the duke of buckingham surveyor , ha ?
where his examination ?
here , so please you .
is he in person ready ?
ay , please your grace .
well , we shall then know more , and buckingham shall lessen this big look .
exeunt cardinal wolsey and his train this butcher cur is , and i have not the power to muzzle him , therefore best not wake him in his slumber .
a beggar book outworths a noble blood .
what , are you chafed ?
ask god for temperance , that the appliance only which your disease requires .
i read in looks matter against me , and his eye reviled me , as his abject object at this instant he bores me with some trick he gone to the king , i follow and outstare him .
stay , my lord , and let your reason with your choler question what is you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a horse , who being allow his way , tires him .
not a man in england can advise me like you be to yourself as you would to your friend .
i to the king , and from a mouth of honour quite cry down this ipswich fellow insolence , or proclaim there difference in no persons .
be advised , heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself we may outrun , by violent swiftness , that which we run at , and lose by .
know you not , the fire that mounts the liquor til run , in seeming to augment it wastes it ?
be advised i say again , there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself , if with the sap of reason you would quench , or but allay , the fire of passion .
sir , i am thankful to you , and i go along by your prescription but this fellow , whom from the flow of gall i name not but from sincere motions , by intelligence , and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of gravel , i do know to be corrupt and treasonous .
say not . '
to the king i , and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock .
attend .
this holy fox , or wolf , or both , for he is equal ravenous as he is subtle , and as prone to mischief as able to , his mind and place infecting one another , yea , reciprocally only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home , suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty , the interview , that swallow so much treasure , and like a glass did break i ' the rinsing .
faith , and so it did .
pray , give me favour , sir .
this cunning cardinal the articles o ' the combination drew as himself pleased , and they were ratified as he cried let be ' to as much end as give a crutch to the dead but our has done this , and is well , for worthy wolsey , who can not err , he did it .
now this follows , which , as i take it , is a kind of puppy to the old dam , treason , charles the emperor , under pretence to see the queen his aunt for was indeed his colour , but he came to whisper wolsey , here makes visitation his fears were , that the interview betwixt england and france might , through their amity , breed him some prejudice , for from this league peep harms that menaced him he privily deals with our cardinal , and , as i trow , which i do well , for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promised , whereby his suit was granted ere it was ask , but when the way was made , and paved with gold , the emperor thus desired , that he would please to alter the king course , and break the foresaid peace .
let the king know , as soon he shall by me , that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour as he pleases , and for his own advantage .
i am sorry to hear this of him , and could wish he were something mistaken i .
no , not a syllable i do pronounce him in that very shape he shall appear in proof .
enter brandon , a before him , and two or three of the guard your office , sergeant , execute it .
sir , my lord the duke of buckingham , and earl of hereford , stafford , and northampton , i arrest thee of high treason , in the name of our most sovereign king .
lo , you , my lord , the net has upon me !
i shall perish under device and practise .
i am sorry to see you from liberty , to look on the business present is his highness ' pleasure you shall to the tower .
it will help me nothing to plead mine innocence , for that dye is on me which makes my whitest part black .
the will of heaven be done in this and all things !
i obey .
o my lord abergavenny , fare you well !
nay , he must bear you company .
the king to abergavenny is pleased you shall to the tower , till you know how he determines further .
as the duke said , the will of heaven be done , and the king pleasure by me obey !
here is a warrant from the king to attach lord montacute , and the bodies of the duke confessor , john de la car , one gilbert peck , his chancellor so , so , these are the limbs o ' the plot no more , i hope .
a monk o ' the chartreux .
o , nicholas hopkins ?
he .
my surveyor is false , the cardinal hath show him gold , my life is spann already i am the shadow of poor buckingham , whose figure even this instant cloud puts on , by darkening my clear sun .
my lord , farewell .

enter king henry viii , leaning on cardinal wolsey shoulder , the nobles , and lovell , cardinal wolsey places himself under king henry viii feet on his right side my life itself , and the best heart of it , thanks you for this great care i stood i ' the level of a confederacy , and give thanks to you that choked it .
let be call before us that gentleman of buckingham , in person i hear him his confessions justify , and point by point the treasons of his master he shall again relate .
a noise within , crying for the queen ! '
enter queen katharine , ushered by norfolk , and suffolk she kneels .
king henry viii riseth from his state , takes her up , kisses and placeth her by him nay , we must longer kneel i am a suitor .
arise , and take place by us half your suit never name to us , you have half our power the other moiety , ere you ask , is given , repeat your will and take it .
thank your majesty .
that you would love yourself , and in that love not unconsider leave your honour , nor the dignity of your office , is the point of my petition .
lady mine , proceed .
i am solicited , not by a few , and those of true condition , that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among , which hath flaw the heart of all their loyalties wherein , although , my good lord cardinal , they vent reproaches most bitterly on you , as putter on of these exactions , yet the king our master whose honour heaven shield from soil ! even he escapes not language unmannerly , yea , such which breaks the sides of loyalty , and almost appears in loud rebellion .
not almost appears , it doth appear , for , upon these taxations , the clothiers all , not able to maintain the many to them longing , have put off the spinsters , carders , fullers , weavers , who , unfit for other life , compell by hunger and lack of other means , in desperate manner daring the event to the teeth , are all in uproar , and danger serves among then !
taxation !
wherein ?
and what taxation ?
my lord cardinal , you that are blamed for it alike with us , know you of this taxation ?
please you , sir , i know but of a single part , in aught pertains to the state , and front but in that file where others tell steps with me .
no , my lord , you know no more than others , but you frame things that are known alike , which are not wholesome to those which would not know them , and yet must perforce be their acquaintance .
these exactions , whereof my sovereign would have note , they are most pestilent to the bearing , and , to bear , the back is sacrifice to the load .
they say they are devised by you , or else you suffer too hard an exclamation .
still exaction !
the nature of it ?
in what kind , let know , is this exaction ?
i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience , but am bolden under your promised pardon .
the subjects ' grief comes through commissions , which compel from each the sixth part of his substance , to be levied without delay , and the pretence for this is named , your wars in france this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out , and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them , their curses now live where their prayers did and it come to pass , this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will .
i would your highness would give it quick consideration , for there is no primer business .
by my life , this is against our pleasure .
and for me , i have no further gone in this than by a single voice , and that not pass me but by learned approbation of the judges .
if i am traduced by ignorant tongues , which neither know my faculties nor person , yet will be the chronicles of my doing , let me say is but the fate of place , and the rough brake that virtue must go through .
we must not stint our necessary actions , in the fear to cope malicious censurers , which ever , as ravenous fishes , do a vessel follow that is , but benefit no further than vainly longing .
what we oft do best , by sick interpreters , once weak ones , is not ours , or not allow , what worst , as oft , hitting a grosser quality , is cried up for our best act .
if we shall stand still , in fear our motion will be mock or carp at , we should take root here where we sit , or sit only .
things done well , and with a care , exempt themselves from fear , things done without example , in their issue are to be fear .
have you a precedent of this commission ?
i believe , not any .
we must not rend our subjects from our laws , and stick them in our will .
sixth part of each ?
a trembling contribution !
why , we take from every tree lop , bark , and part o ' the timber , and , though we leave it with a root , thus hack , the air will drink the sap .
to every county where this is question send our letters , with free pardon to each man that has denied the force of this commission pray , look , i put it to your care .
a word with you .
to the secretary let there be letters writ to every shire , of the king grace and pardon .
the grieved commons hardly conceive of me , let it be noised that through our intercession this revokement and pardon comes i shall anon advise you further in the proceeding .
exit secretary enter surveyor i am sorry that the duke of buckingham is run in your displeasure .
it grieves many the gentleman is learn , and a most rare speaker , to nature none more bound , his training such , that he may furnish and instruct great teachers , and never seek for aid out of himself .
yet see , when these so noble benefits shall prove not well disposed , the mind growing once corrupt , they turn to vicious forms , ten times more ugly than ever they were fair .
this man so complete , who was enroll wonders , and when we , almost with ravish listening , could not find his hour of speech a minute , he , my lady , hath into monstrous habits put the graces that once were his , and is become as black as if besmear in hell .
sit by us , you shall hear this was his gentleman in trust of him things to strike honour sad .
bid him recount the practises , whereof we can not feel too little , hear too much .
stand forth , and with bold spirit relate what you , most like a careful subject , have collected out of the duke of buckingham .
speak freely .
first , it was usual with him , every day it would infect his speech , that if the king should without issue die , he carry it so to make the sceptre his these very words i heard him utter to his , lord abergavenny , to whom by oath he menaced revenge upon the cardinal .
please your highness , note this dangerous conception in this point .
not friended by by his wish , to your high person his will is most malignant , and it stretches beyond you , to your friends .
my learn lord cardinal , deliver all with charity .
speak on how grounded he his title to the crown , upon our fail ?
to this point hast thou heard him at any time speak aught ?
he was brought to this by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins .
what was that hopkins ?
sir , a chartreux friar , his confessor , who fed him every minute with words of sovereignty .
how thou this ?
not long before your highness sped to france , the duke being at the rose , within the parish saint lawrence poultney , did of me demand what was the speech among the londoners concerning the french journey i replied , men fear the french would prove perfidious , to the king danger .
presently the duke said , was the fear , indeed , and that he doubted prove the verity of certain words spoke by a holy monk , oft , ' says he , sent to me , wishing me to permit john de la car , my chaplain , a choice hour to hear from him a matter of some moment whom after under the confession seal he solemnly had sworn , that what he spoke my chaplain to no creature living , but to me , should utter , with demure confidence this pausingly ensued neither the king nor heirs , tell you the duke , shall prosper bid him strive to gain the love o ' the commonalty the duke shall govern england . '
if i know you well , you were the duke surveyor , and lost your office on the complaint o ' the tenants take good heed you charge not in your spleen a noble person and spoil your nobler soul i say , take heed , yes , heartily beseech you .
let him on .
go forward .
on my soul , i speak but truth .
i told my lord the duke , by the devil illusions the monk might be deceived , and that was dangerous for him to ruminate on this so far , until it forged him some design , which , being believed , it was much like to do he answer , , it can do me no damage , ' adding further , that , had the king in his last sickness fail , the cardinal and sir thomas lovell heads should have gone off .
ha !
what , so rank ?
ah ha !
there mischief in this man canst thou say further ?
i can , my liege .
proceed .

'

new customs , though they be never so ridiculous , nay , let be unmanly , yet are follow .
as far as i see , all the good our english have got by the late voyage is but merely a fit or two o ' the face , but they are shrewd ones , for when they hold , you would swear directly their very noses had been counsellors to pepin or clotharius , they keep state so .

they must either , for so run the conditions , leave those remnants of fool and feather that they got in france , with all their honourable point of ignorance pertaining thereunto , as fights and fireworks , abusing better men than they can be , out of a foreign wisdom , renouncing clean the faith they have in tennis , and tall stockings , short blister breeches , and those types of travel , and understand again like honest men , or pack to their old playfellows there , i take it , they may , privilegio , ' wear away the lag end of their lewdness and be laugh at .
is time to give physic , their diseases are grown so catching .
what a loss our ladies will have of these trim vanities !
ay , marry , there will be woe indeed , lords the sly whoresons have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies , a french song and a fiddle has no fellow .

whispers the masquers what say they ?

let me see , then .
by all your good leaves , gentlemen , here i make my royal choice .
ye have found him , cardinal unmasking you hold a fair assembly , you do well , lord you are a churchman , or , i tell you , cardinal , i should judge now unhappily .
i am glad your grace is grown so pleasant .

let the music knock it .
exeunt with trumpets act ii scene westminster .
a street .
enter two gentlemen , meeting whither away so fast ?
o , god save ye !
even to the hall , to hear what shall become of the great duke of buckingham .
i save you that labour , sir .
all now done , but the ceremony of bringing back the prisoner .
were you there ?
yes , indeed , was i .
pray , speak what has happen .
you may guess quickly what .
is he found guilty ?
yes , truly is he , and condemn upo .
i am sorry .
so are a number more .
but , pray , how pass it ?
i tell you in a little .
the great duke came to the bar , where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law .
the king attorney on the contrary urged on the examinations , proofs , confessions of divers witnesses , which the duke desired to have brought viva voce to his face at which appear against him his surveyor , sir gilbert peck his chancellor , and john car , confessor to him , with that , hopkins , that made this mischief .
that was he that fed him with his prophecies ?
the same .
all these accused him strongly , which he fain would have flung from him , but , indeed , he could not and so his peers , upon this evidence , have found him guilty of high treason .
much he spoke , and learnedly , for life , but all was either pitied in him or forgotten .
after all this , how did he bear himself ?
when he was brought again to the bar , to hear his knell rung out , his judgment , he was stirr with such an agony , he sweat extremely , and something spoke in choler , ill , and hasty but he fell to himself again , and sweetly in all the rest show a most noble patience .
i do not think he fears death .
sure , he does not he never was so womanish , the cause he may a little grieve at .
certainly the cardinal is the end of this .
is likely , by all conjectures first , kildare attainder , then deputy of ireland , who removed , earl surrey was sent thither , and in haste too , lest he should help his father .
that trick of state was a deep envious one .
at his return no doubt he will requite it .
this is noted , and generally , whoever the king favours , the cardinal instantly will find employment , and far enough from court too .
all the commons hate him perniciously , and , o ' my conscience , wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much they love and dote on , call him bounteous buckingham , the mirror of all courtesy , stay there , sir , and see the noble ruin man you speak of .
enter buckingham from his arraignment , before him , the axe with the edge towards him , halberds on each side accompanied with lovell , vaux , sands , and common people let stand close , and behold him .
all good people , you that thus far have come to pity me , hear what i say , and then go home and lose me .
i have this day received a traitor judgment , and by that name must die yet , heaven bear witness , and if i have a co nscience , let it sink me , even as the axe falls , if i be not faithful !
the law i bear no malice for my death , has done , upon the premises , but justice but those that sought it i could wish more christians be what they will , i heartily forgive yet let look they glory not in mischief , nor build their evils on the graves of great men , for then my guiltless blood must cry against .
for further life in this world i hope , nor will i sue , although the king have mercies more than i dare make faults .
you few that loved me , and dare be bold to weep for buckingham , his noble friends and fellows , whom to leave is only bitter to him , only dying , go with me , like good angels , to my end , and , as the long divorce of steel falls on me , make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice , and lift my soul to heaven .
lead on , o ' god name .
i do beseech your grace , for charity , if ever any malice in your heart were hid against me , now to forgive me frankly .
sir thomas lovell , i as free forgive you as i would be forgiven i forgive all , there can not be those numberless offences me , that i can not take peace with no black envy shall mark my grave .
commend me to his grace , and if he speak of buckingham , pray , tell him you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers yet are the king , and , till my soul forsake , shall cry for blessings on him may he live longer than i have time to tell his years !
ever beloved and loving may his rule be !
and when old time shall lead him to his end , goodness and he fill up one monument !
to the water side i must conduct your grace , then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux , who undertakes you to your end .
prepare there , the duke is coming see the barge be ready , and fit it with such furniture as suits the greatness of his person .
nay , sir nicholas , let it alone , my state now will but mock me .
when i came hither , i was lord high constable and duke of buckingham , now , poor edward bohun yet i am richer than my base accusers , that never knew what truth meant i now seal it , and with that blood will make one day groan .
my noble father , henry of buckingham , who first raised head against usurping richard , flying for succor to his servant banister , being distress , was by that wretch betray , and without trial fell , god peace be with him !
henry the seventh succeeding , truly pitying my father loss , like a most royal prince , restored me to my honours , and , out of ruins , made my name once more noble .
now his son , henry the eighth , life , honour , name and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken for ever from the world .
i had my trial , and , must needs say , a noble one , which makes me , a little happier than my wretched father yet thus far we are one in fortunes both fell by our servants , by those men we loved most , a most unnatural and faithless service !
heaven has an end in all yet , you that hear me , this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you be not loose , for those you make friends and give your hearts to , when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes , fall away like water from ye , never found again but where they mean to sink ye .
all good people , pray for me !
i must now forsake ye the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me .
farewell and when you would say something that is sad , speak how i fell .
i have done , and god forgive me !
exeunt buckingham and train o , this is full of pity !
sir , it calls , i fear , too many curses on their beads that were the authors .
if the duke be guiltless , is full of woe yet i can give you inkling of an ensuing evil , if it fall , greater than this .
good angels keep it from us !
what may it be ?
you do not doubt my faith , sir ?
this secret is so weighty , require a strong faith to conceal it .
let me have it , i do not talk much .
i am confident , you shall , sir did you not of late days hear a buzzing of a separation between the king and katharine ?
yes , but it held not for when the king once heard it , out of anger he sent command to the lord mayor straight to stop the rumor , and allay those tongues that durst disperse it .
but that slander , sir , is found a truth now for it grows again fresher than it was , and held for certain the king will venture at it .
either the cardinal , or some about him near , have , out of malice to the good queen , possess him with a scruple that will undo her to confirm this too , cardinal campeius is arrived , and lately , as all think , for this business .
is the cardinal , and merely to revenge him on the emperor for not bestowing on him , at his asking , the archbishopric of toledo , this is purposed .
i think you have hit the mark but not cruel that she should feel the smart of this ?
the cardinal will have his will , and she must fall .
is woful .
we are too open here to argue this , let think in private more .
exeunt scene ii .
an in the palace .
enter chamberlain , reading a letter lord , the horses your lordship sent for , with all the care i had , i saw well chosen , ridden , and furnished .
they were young and handsome , and of the best breed in the north .
when they were ready to set out for london , a man of my lord cardinal , by commission and main power , took from me , with this reason his master would be served before a subject , if not before the king , which stopped our mouths , sir . '
i fear he will indeed well , let him have them he will have all , i think .
enter , to chamberlain , norfolk and suffolk well met , my lord chamberlain .
good day to both your graces .
how is the king employ ?
i left him private , full of sad thoughts and troubles .
what the cause ?
it seems the marriage with his brother wife has crept too near his conscience .
no , his conscience has crept too near another lady .
is so this is the cardinal doing , the that blind priest , like the eldest son of fortune , turns what he list .
the king will know him one day .
pray god he do !
he never know himself else .
how holily he works in all his business !
and with what zeal !
for , now he has crack the league between us and the emperor , the queen great nephew , he dives into the king soul , and there scatters dangers , doubts , wringing of the conscience , fears , and despairs , and all these for his marriage and out of all these to restore the king , he counsels a divorce , a loss of her that , like a jewel , has hung twenty years about his neck , yet never lost her lustre , of her that loves him with that excellence that angels love good men with , even of her that , when the greatest stroke of fortune falls , will bless the king and is not this course pious ?
heaven keep me from such counsel !
is most true these news are every where , every tongue speaks , and every true heart weeps all that dare look into these affairs see this main end , the french king sister .
heaven will one day open the king eyes , that so long have slept upon this bold bad man .
and free us from his slavery .
we had need pray , and heartily , for our deliverance , or this imperious man will work us all from princes into pages all men honours lie like one lump before him , to be fashion into what pitch he please .
for me , my lords , i love him not , nor fear him , there my creed as i am made without him , so i stand , if the king please , his curses and his blessings touch me alike , they breath i not believe in .
i knew him , and i know him , so i leave him to him that made him proud , the pope .
let in , and with some other business put the king from these sad thoughts , that work too much upon him my lord , you bear us company ?
excuse me , the king has sent me otherwhere besides , you find a most unfit time to disturb him health to your lordships .
thanks , my good lord chamberlain .
exit chamberlain , and king henry viii draws the curtain , and sits reading pensively how sad he looks !
sure , he is much afflicted .
who there , ha ?
pray god he be not angry .

how dare you thrust yourselves into my private meditations ?

all the clerks , i mean the learned ones , in christian kingdoms have their free voices rome , the nurse of judgment , invited by your noble self , hath sent one general tongue unto us , this good man , this just and learned priest , cardinal campeius , whom once more i present unto your highness .
and once more in mine arms i bid him welcome , and thank the holy conclave for their loves they have sent me such a man i would have wish for .
your grace must needs deserve all strangers ' loves , you are so noble .
to your highness ' hand i tender my commission , by whose virtue , the court of rome commanding , you , my lord cardinal of york , are join with me their servant in the unpartial judging of this business .
two equal men .
the queen shall be acquainted forthwith for what you come .

i know your majesty has always loved her so dear in heart , not to deny her that a woman of less place might ask by law scholars allow freely to argue for her .
ay , and the best she shall have , and my favour to him that does best god forbid else .
cardinal , prithee , call gardiner to me , my new secretary i find him a fit fellow .
exit cardinal wolsey cardinal wolsey , with gardiner aside to gardiner give me your hand much joy and favour to you , you are the king now .

come hither , gardiner .
walks and whispers my lord of york , was not one doctor pace in this man place before him ?
yes , he was .
was he not held a learned man ?
yes , surely .
believe me , there an ill opinion spread then even of yourself , lord cardinal .
how !
of me ?
they will not stick to say you envied him , and fearing he would rise , he was so virtuous , kept him a foreign man still , which so grieved him , that he ran mad and died .
heaven peace be with him !
that christian care enough for living murmurers there places of rebuke .
he was a fool , for he would needs be virtuous that good fellow , if i command him , follows my appointment i will have none so near else .
learn this , brother , we live not to be grip by meaner persons .
deliver this with modesty to the queen .
exit gardiner the most convenient place that i can think of for such receipt of learning is , there ye shall meet about this weighty business .
my wolsey , see it furnish .
o , my lord , would it not grieve an able man to leave so sweet a bedfellow ?
but , conscience , conscience !
o , is a tender place , and i must leave her .
exeunt scene iii .
an of the queen apartments .
enter anne and an old lady not for that neither here the pang that pinches his highness having lived so long with her , and she so good a lady that no tongue could ever pronounce dishonour of her , by my life , she never knew o , now , after so many courses of the sun enthroned , still growing in a majesty and pomp , the which to leave a more bitter than is sweet at first to acquire , after this process , to give her the avaunt !
it is a pity would move a monster .
hearts of most hard temper melt and lament for her .
o , god will !
much better she had known pomp be temporal , yet , if that quarrel , fortune , do divorce it from the bearer , is a sufferance panging as soul and body severing .
alas , poor lady !
she a stranger now again .
so much the more must pity drop upon her .
verily , i swear , is better to be lowly born , and range with humble livers in content , than to be perk up in a glistering grief , and wear a golden sorrow .
our content is our best having .
by my troth and maidenhead , i would not be a queen .
beshrew me , i would , and venture maidenhead , and so would you , for all this spice of your hypocrisy you , that have so fair parts of woman on you , have too a woman heart , which ever yet affected eminence , wealth , sovereignty , which , to say sooth , are blessings , and which gifts , saving your mincing , the capacity of your soft cheveril conscience would receive , if you might please to stretch it .
nay , good troth .
yes , troth , and troth , you would not be a queen ?
no , not for all the riches under heaven .
old lady strange a bow would hire me , old as i am , to queen it but , i pray you , what think you of a duchess ?
have you limbs to bear that load of title ?
no , in truth .
then you are weakly made pluck off a little , i would not be a young count in your way , for more than blushing comes to if your back can not vouchsafe this burthen , is too weak ever to get a boy .
how you do talk !
i swear again , i would not be a queen for all the world .
in faith , for little england venture an emballing i myself would for carnarvonshire , although there long no more to the crown but that .
lo , who comes here ?
enter chamberlain good morrow , ladies .
what worth to know the secret of your conference ?
my good lord , not your demand , it values not your asking our mistress ' sorrows we were pitying .
it was a gentle business , and becoming the action of good women there is hope all will be well .
now , i pray god , amen !
you bear a gentle mind , and heavenly blessings follow such creatures .
that you may , fair lady , perceive i speak sincerely , and high note of your many virtues , the king majesty commends his good opinion of you , and does purpose honour to you no less flowing than marchioness of pembroke to which title a thousand pound a year , annual support , out of his grace he adds .
i do not know what kind of my obedience i should tender , more than my all is nothing nor my prayers are not words duly hallow , nor my wishes more worth than empty vanities , yet prayers and wishes are all i can return .
beseech your lordship , vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience , as from a blushing handmaid , to his highness , whose health and royalty i pray for .
lady , i shall not fail to approve the fair conceit the king hath of you .
aside i have perused her well , beauty and honour in her are so mingled that they have caught the king and who knows yet but from this lady may proceed a gem to lighten all this isle ?
i to the king , and say i spoke with you .
exit chamberlain my honour lord .

this is strange to me .
how tastes it ?

come , you are pleasant .
with your theme , i could the lark .
the marchioness of pembroke !
a thousand pounds a year for pure respect !
no other obligation !
by my life , that promises moe thousands honour train is longer than his foreskirt .
by this time i know your back will bear a duchess say , are you not stronger than you were ?
good lady , make yourself mirth with your particular fancy , and leave me out o .
would i had no being , if this salute my blood a jot it faints me , to think what follows .

alas , sir , in what have i offended you ?
what cause hath my behavior given to your displeasure , that thus you should proceed to put me off , and take your good grace from me ?
heaven witness , i have been to you a true and humble wife , at all times to your will conformable , ever in fear to kindle your dislike , yea , subject to your countenance , glad or sorry as i saw it inclined when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire , or made it not mine too ?
or which of your friends have i not strove to love , although i knew he were mine enemy ?
what friend of mine that had to him derived your anger , did i continue in my liking ?
nay , gave notice he was from thence discharged .
sir , call to mind that i have been your wife , in this obedience , upward of twenty years , and have been blest with many children by you if , in the course and process of this time , you can report , and prove it too , against mine honour aught , my bond to wedlock , or my love and duty , against your sacred person , in god name , turn me away , and let the contempt shut door upon me , and so give me up to the kind of justice .
please you sir , the king , your father , was reputed for a prince most prudent , of an excellent and unmatch wit and judgment ferdinand , my father , king of spain , was reckon one the wisest prince that there had reign by many a year before it is not to be question that they had gather a wise council to them of every realm , that did debate this business , who deem our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly beseech you , sir , to spare me , till i may be by my friends in spain advised , whose counsel i will implore if not , i ' the name of god , your pleasure be fulfill !
you have here , lady , and of your choice , these reverend fathers , men of singular integrity and learning , yea , the elect o ' the land , who are assembled to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless that longer you desire the court , as well for your own quiet , as to rectify what is unsettled in the king .
his grace hath spoken well and justly therefore , madam , it fit this royal session do proceed , and that , without delay , their arguments be now produced and heard .
lord cardinal , to you i speak .
your pleasure , madam ?
sir , i am about to weep , but , thinking that we are a queen , or long have dream so , certain the daughter of a king , my drops of tears i turn to sparks of fire .
be patient yet .
i will , when you are humble , nay , before , or god will punish me .
i do believe , induced by potent circumstances , that you are mine enemy , and make my challenge you shall not be my judge for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me , which god dew quench !
therefore i say again , i utterly abhor , yea , from my soul refuse you for my judge , whom , yet once more , i hold my most malicious foe , and think not at all a friend to truth .
i do profess you speak not like yourself , who ever yet have stood to charity , and display the effects of disposition gentle , and of wisdom woman power .
madam , you do me wrong i have no spleen against you , nor injustice for you or any how far i have proceeded , or how far further shall , is warranted by a commission from the consistory , yea , the whole consistory of rome .
you charge me that i have blown this coal i do deny it the king is present if it be known to him that i gainsay my deed , how may he wound , and worthily , my falsehood !
yea , as much as you have done my truth .
if he know that i am free of your report , he knows i am not of your wrong .
therefore in him it lies to cure me and the cure is , to remove these thoughts from you the which before his highness shall speak in , i do beseech you , gracious madam , to unthink your speaking and to say so no more .
my lord , my lord , i am a simple woman , much too weak to oppose your cunning .
you meek and , you sign your place and calling , in full seeming , with meekness and humility , but your heart is cramm with arrogancy , spleen , and pride .
you have , by fortune and his highness ' favours , gone slightly low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers , and your words , domestics to you , serve your will please yourself pronounce their office .
i must tell you , you tender more your person honour than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge , and here , before you all , appeal unto the pope , to bring my whole cause his holiness , and to be judged by him .
she curtsies to king henry viii , and offers to depart the queen is obstinate , stubborn to justice , apt to accuse it , and disdainful to be tried is not well .
she going away .
call her again .
katharine queen of england , come into the court .
madam , you are call back .
what need you note it ?
pray you , keep your way when you are call , return .
now , the lord help , they vex me past my patience !
pray you , pass on i will not tarry , no , nor ever more upon this business my appearance make in any of their courts .
exeunt queen katharine and her attendants go thy ways , kate that man i ' the world who shall report he has a better wife , let him in nought be trusted , for speaking false in that thou art , alone , if thy rare qualities , sweet gentleness , thy meekness , government , obeying in commanding , and thy parts sovereign and pious else , could speak thee out , the queen of earthly queens she noble born , and , like her true nobility , she has carried herself towards me .
most gracious sir , in humblest manner i require your highness , that it shall please you to declare , in hearing of all these ears , for where i am robb and bound , there must i be unloosed , although not there at once and fully satisfied , whether ever i did broach this business to your highness , or laid any scruple in your way , which might induce you to the question o ?
or ever have to you , but with thanks to god for such a royal lady , spake one the least word that might be to the prejudice of her present state , or touch of her good person ?
my lord cardinal , i do excuse you , yea , upon mine honour , i free you .
you are not to be taught that you have many enemies , that know not why they are so , but , like to , bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger .
you excused but will you be more justified ?
you ever have wish the sleeping of this business , never desired it to be stirr , but oft have hinder , oft , the passages made toward it on my honour , i speak my good lord cardinal to this point , and thus far clear him .
now , what moved me , i will be bold with time and your attention then mark the inducement .
thus it came , give heed my conscience first received a tenderness , scruple , and prick , on certain speeches utter by the bishop of bayonne , then french ambassador , who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i ' the progress of this business , ere a determinate resolution , he , i mean the bishop , did require a respite , wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate , respecting this our marriage with the dowager , sometimes our brother wife .
this respite shook the bosom of my conscience , enter me , yea , with a splitting power , and made to tremble the region of my breast , which forced such way , that many mazed considerings did throng and press in with this caution .
first , methought i stood not in the smile of heaven , who had commanded nature , that my lady womb , if it conceived a male child by me , should do no more offices of life than the grave does to the dead , for her male issue or died where they were made , or shortly after this world had air them hence i took a thought , this was a judgment on me , that my kingdom , well worthy the best heir o ' the world , should not be gladded i by me then follows , that i weigh the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue fail , and that gave to me many a groaning throe .
thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience , i did steer toward this remedy , whereupon we are now present here together that to say , i meant to rectify my conscience , which i then did feel full sick , and yet not well , by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learn first i began in private with you , my lord of lincoln , you remember how under my oppression i did reek , when i first moved you .
very well , my liege .
i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me .
so please your highness , the question did at first so stagger me , bearing a state of mighty moment i and consequence of dread , that i committed the counsel which i had to doubt , and did entreat your highness to this course which you are running here .
i then moved you , my lord of canterbury , and got your leave to make this present summons unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court , but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore , go on for no dislike i ' the world against the person of the good queen , but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons , drive this forward prove but our marriage lawful , by my life and kingly dignity , we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her , katharine our queen , before the primest creature that paragon o ' the world .
so please your highness , the queen being absent , is a needful fitness that we adjourn this court till further day meanwhile must be an earnest motion made to the queen , to call back her appeal she intends unto his holiness .
aside i may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome .
my learn and servant , cranmer , prithee , return with thy approach , i know , my comfort comes along .
break up the court i say , set on .
exeunt in manner as they entered act iii scene london .
queen katharine apartments .
enter queen katharine and her women , as at work take thy lute , wench my soul grows sad with troubles , sing , and disperse , if thou canst leave working .
song orpheus with his lute made trees , and the mountain tops that freeze , bow themselves when he did sing to his music plants and flowers ever sprung , as sun and showers there had made a lasting spring .
every thing that heard him play , even the billows of the sea , hung their heads , and then lay by .
in sweet music is such art , killing care and grief of heart fall asleep , or hearing , die .
enter a gentleman how now !
a please your grace , the two great cardinals wait in the presence .
would they speak with me ?
they will me say so , madam .
pray their graces to come near .
exit gentleman what can be their business with me , a poor weak woman , from favour ?
i do not like their coming .
now i think o , they should be good men , their affairs as righteous but all hoods make not monks .
enter cardinal wolsey and cardinal campeius peace to your highness !
your graces find me here part of a housewife , i would be all , against the worst may happen .
what are your pleasures with me , reverend lords ?
may it please you noble madam , to withdraw into your private chamber , we shall give you the full cause of our coming .
speak it here there nothing i have done yet , o ' my conscience , deserves a corner would all other women could speak this with as free a soul as i do !
my lords , i care not , so much i am happy above a number , if my actions were tried by every tongue , every eye saw , envy and base opinion set against , i know my life so even .
if your business seek me out , and that way i am wife in , out with it boldly truth loves open dealing .
tanta est erga te mentis integritas , regina serenissima , o , good my lord , no latin , i am not such a truant since my coming , as not to know the language i have lived in a strange tongue makes my cause more strange , suspicious , pray , speak in english here are some will thank you , if you speak truth , for their poor mistress ' sake , believe me , she has had much wrong lord cardinal , the sin i ever yet committed may be absolved in english .
noble lady , i am sorry my integrity should breed , and service to his majesty and you , so deep suspicion , where all faith was meant .
we come not by the way of accusation , to taint that honour every good tongue blesses , nor to betray you any way to sorrow , you have too much , good lady , but to know how you stand minded in the weighty difference between the king and you , and to deliver , like free and honest men , our just opinions and comforts to your cause .
most honour madam , my lord of york , out of his noble nature , zeal and obedience he still bore your grace , forgetting , like a good man your late censure both of his truth and him , which was too far , offers , as i do , in a sign of peace , his service and his counsel .
aside to betray my lords , i thank you both for your good wills , ye speak like honest men , pray god , ye prove so !
but how to make ye suddenly an answer , in such a point of weight , so near mine honour , more near my life , i fear , with my weak wit , and to such men of gravity and learning , in truth , i know not .
i was set at work among my maids full little , god knows , looking either for such men or such business .
for her sake that i have been , for i feel the last fit of my greatness , good your graces , let me have time and counsel for my cause alas , i am a woman , friendless , hopeless !
madam , you wrong the king love with these fears your hopes and friends are infinite .
in england but little for my profit can you think , lords , that any englishman dare give me counsel ?
or be a known friend , his highness ' pleasure , though he be grown so desperate to be honest , and live a subject ?
nay , forsooth , my friends , they that must weigh out my afflictions , they that my trust must grow to , live not here they are , as all my other comforts , far hence in mine own country , lords .
i would your grace would leave your griefs , and take my counsel .
how , sir ?
put your main cause into the king protection , he loving and most gracious be much both for your honour better and your cause , for if the trial of the law ye , you part away disgraced .
he tells you rightly .
ye tell me what ye wish for both , my ruin is this your christian counsel ?
out upon ye !
heaven is above all yet , there sits a judge that no king can corrupt .
your rage mistakes us .
the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye , upon my soul , two reverend cardinal virtues , but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye mend , for shame , my lords .
is this your comfort ?
the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady , a woman lost among ye , laugh at , scorn ?
i will not wish ye half my miseries , i have more charity but say , i warn ye , take heed , for heaven sake , take heed , lest at once the burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye .
madam , this is a mere distraction , you turn the good we offer into envy .
ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye and all such false professors !
would you have me if you have any justice , any pity , if ye be any thing but churchmen habits put my sick cause into his hands that hates me ?
alas , has banish me his bed already , his love , too long ago !
i am old , my lords , and all the fellowship i hold now with him is only my obedience .
what can happen to me above this wretchedness ?
all your studies make me a curse like this .
your fears are worse .
have i lived thus long let me speak myself , since virtue finds no friends a wife , a true one ?
a woman , i dare say without , never yet branded with suspicion ?
have i with all my full affections still met the king ?
loved him next heaven ?
obey him ?
been , out of fondness , superstitious to him ?
almost forgot my prayers to content him ?
and am i thus rewarded ?
is not well , lords .
bring me a constant woman to her husband , one that dream a joy beyond his pleasure , and to that woman , when she has done most , yet will i add an honour , a great patience .
madam , you wander from the good we aim at .
my lord , i dare not make myself so guilty , to give up willingly that noble title your master wed me to nothing but death shall divorce my dignities .
pray , hear me .
would i had never trod this english earth , or felt the flatteries that grow upon it !
ye have angels ' faces , but heaven knows your hearts .
what will become of me now , wretched lady !
i am the most unhappy woman living .
alas , poor wenches , where are now your fortunes !
shipwreck upon a kingdom , where no pity , no friend , no hope , no kindred weep for me , almost no grave allow me like the lily , that once was mistress of the field and flourish , i hang my head and perish .
if your grace could but be brought to know our ends are honest , feel more comfort why should we , good lady , upon what cause , wrong you ?
alas , our places , the way of our profession is against it we are to cure such sorrows , not to sow .
for goodness ' sake , consider what you do , how you may hurt yourself , ay , utterly grow from the king acquaintance , by this carriage .
the hearts of princes kiss obedience , so much they love it , but to stubborn spirits they swell , and grow as terrible as storms .
i know you have a gentle , noble temper , a soul as even as a calm pray , think us those we profess , , friends , and servants .
madam , you find it so .
you wrong your virtues with these weak women fears a noble spirit , as yours was put into you , ever casts such doubts , as false coin , from it .
the king loves you , beware you lose it not for us , if you please to trust us in your business , we are ready to use our utmost studies in your service .
do what ye will , my lords and , pray , forgive me , if i have used myself unmannerly , you know i am a woman , lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons .
pray , do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet , and shall have my prayers while i shall have my life .
come , reverend fathers , bestow your counsels on me she now begs , that little thought , when she set footing here , she should have bought her dignities so dear .
exeunt scene ii .
to king henry viii apartment .
enter norfolk , suffolk , surrey , and chamberlain if you will now unite in your complaints , and force them with a constancy , the cardinal can not stand under them if you omit the offer of this time , i can not promise but that you shall sustain moe new disgraces , with these you bear already .
i am joyful to meet the least occasion that may give me remembrance of my , the duke , to be revenged on him .
which of the peers have uncontemn gone by him , or at least strangely neglected ?
when did he regard the stamp of nobleness in any person out of himself ?
my lords , you speak your pleasures what he deserves of you and me i know , what we can do to him , though now the time gives way to us , i much fear .
if you can not bar his access to the king , never attempt any thing on him , for he hath a witchcraft over the king in tongue .
o , fear him not , his spell in that is out the king hath found matter against him that for ever mars the honey of his language .
no , he settled , not to come off , in his displeasure .
sir , i should be glad to hear such news as this once every hour .
believe it , this is true in the divorce his contrary proceedings are all unfolded wherein he appears as i would wish mine enemy .
how came his practises to light ?
most strangely .
o , how , how ?
the cardinal letters to the pope miscarried , and came to the eye o ' the king wherein was read , how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness to stay the judgment o ' the divorce , for if it did take place , ' i do , ' quoth he , my king is tangled in affection to a creature of the queen , lady anne bullen . '
has the king this ?
believe it .
will this work ?
the king in this perceives him , how he coasts and hedges his own way .
but in this point all his tricks founder , and he brings his physic after his patient death the king already hath married the fair lady .
would he had !
may you be happy in your wish , my lord for , i profess , you have it .
now , all my joy trace the conjunction !
my amen !
all men !
there order given for her coronation marry , this is yet but young , and may be left to some ears unrecounted .
but , my lords , she is a gallant creature , and complete in mind and feature i persuade me , from her will fall some blessing to this land , which shall in it be memorised .
but , will the king digest this letter of the cardinal ?
the lord forbid !
marry , amen !
no , no , there be moe wasps that buzz about his nose will make this sting the sooner .
cardinal campeius is away to rome , hath no leave , has left the cause o ' the king unhandled , and is posted , as the agent of our cardinal , to second all his plot .
i do assure you the king cried ha !
at this .
now , god incense him , and let him cry ha !
louder !
but , my lord , when returns cranmer ?
he is return in his opinions , which have satisfied the king for his divorce , together with all famous colleges almost in christendom shortly , i believe , his second marriage shall be publish , and her coronation .
katharine no more shall be call queen , but princess dowager and widow to prince arthur .
this same cranmer a worthy fellow , and hath much pain in the king business .
he has , and we shall see him for it an archbishop .
so i hear .
is so .
the cardinal !
enter cardinal wolsey and cromwell observe , observe , he moody .
the packet , cromwell .
you the king ?
to his own hand , in bedchamber .
look he o ' the inside of the paper ?
presently he did unseal them and the first he view , he did it with a serious mind , a heed was in his countenance .
you he bade attend him here this morning .
is he ready to come abroad ?
i think , by this he is .
leave me awhile .
exit cromwell aside it shall be to the duchess of alencon , the french king sister he shall marry her .
anne bullen !
no , i no anne bullens for him there more i than fair visage .
bullen !
no , we no bullens .
speedily i wish to hear from rome .
the marchioness of pembroke !
he discontented .
may be , he hears the king does whet his anger to him .
sharp enough , lord , for thy justice !
aside the late queen gentlewoman , a knight daughter , to be her mistress ' mistress !
the queen queen !
this candle burns not clear is i must snuff it , then out it goes .
what though i know her virtuous and well deserving ?
yet i know her for a spleeny lutheran , and not wholesome to our cause , that she should lie i ' the bosom of our king .
again , there is sprung up an heretic , an arch one , cranmer , one hath crawl into the favour of the king , and is his oracle .
he is vex at something .
i would something that would fret the string , the on heart !
enter king henry viii , reading of a schedule , and lovell the king , the king !
what piles of wealth hath he accumulated to his own portion !
and what expense by the hour seems to flow from him !
how , i ' the name of thrift , does he rake this together !
now , my lords , saw you the cardinal ?
my lord , we have stood here observing him some strange commotion is in his brain he bites his lip , and starts , stops on a sudden , looks upon the ground , then lays his finger on his temple , straight springs out into fast gait , then stops again , strikes his breast hard , and anon he casts his eye against the moon in most strange postures we have seen him set himself .
it may well be , there is a mutiny in mind .
this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse , as i required and wot you what i found there , on my conscience , put unwittingly ?
forsooth , an inventory , thus importing , the several parcels of his plate , his treasure , rich stuffs , and ornaments of household , which i find at such proud rate , that it possession of a subject .
it heaven will some spirit put this paper in the packet , to bless your eye withal .
if we did think his contemplation were above the earth , and fix on spiritual object , he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon , not worth his serious considering .
king henry viii takes his seat , whispers lovell , who goes to cardinal wolsey heaven forgive me !
ever god bless your highness !
good my lord , you are full of heavenly stuff , and bear the inventory of your best graces in your mind , the which you were now running you have scarce time to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span to keep your earthly audit sure , in that i deem you an ill husband , and am glad to have you therein my companion .
sir , for holy offices i have a time , a time to think upon the part of business which i bear i ' the state , and nature does require her times of preservation , which perforce i , her frail son , amongst my brethren mortal , must give my tendence to .
you have said well .
and ever may your highness yoke together , as i will lend you cause , my doing well with my well saying !
is well said again , and is a kind of good deed to say well and yet words are no deeds .
my father loved you his said he did , and with his deed did crown his word upon you .
since i had my office , i have kept you next my heart , have not alone employ you where high profits might come home , but pared my present havings , to bestow my bounties upon you .
aside what should this mean ?
aside the lord increase this business !
have i not made you , the prime man of the state ?
i pray you , tell me , if what i now pronounce you have found true and , if you may confess it , say withal , if you are bound to us or no .
what say you ?
my sovereign , i confess your royal graces , shower on me daily , have been more than could my studied purposes requite , which went beyond all man endeavours my endeavours have ever come too short of my desires , yet filed with my abilities mine own ends have been mine so that evermore they pointed to the good of your most sacred person and the profit of the state .
for your great graces heap upon me , poor undeserver , i can nothing render but allegiant thanks , my prayers to heaven for you , my loyalty , which ever has and ever shall be growing , till death , that winter , kill it .
fairly answer , a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated the honour of it does pay the act of it , as , i ' the contrary , the foulness is the punishment .
i presume that , as my hand has open bounty to you , my heart dropp love , my power rain honour , more on you than any , so your hand and heart , your brain , and every function of your power , should , notwithstanding that your bond of duty , as in love particular , be more to me , your friend , than any .
i do profess that for your highness ' good i ever labour more than mine own , that am , have , and will be though all the world should crack their duty to you , and throw it from their soul , though perils did abound , as thick as thought could make , and appear in forms more horrid , yet my duty , as doth a rock against the chiding flood , should the approach of this wild river break , and stand unshaken yours .
is nobly spoken take notice , lords , he has a loyal breast , for you have seen him ope .
read this , giving him papers and after , this and then to breakfast with what appetite you have .
exit king henry viii , frowning upon cardinal wolsey the nobles throng after him , smiling and whispering what should this mean ?
what sudden anger this ?
how have i reap it ?
he parted frowning from me , as if ruin leap from his eyes so looks the chafed lion upon the daring huntsman that has gall him , then makes him nothing .
i must read this paper , i fear , the story of his anger .
is so , this paper has undone me is the account of all that world of wealth i have drawn together for mine own ends , indeed , to gain the popedom , and fee my friends in rome .
o negligence !
fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king ?
is there no way to cure this ?
no new device to beat this from his brains ?
i know stir him strongly , yet i know a way , if it take right , in spite of fortune will bring me off again .
what this ?
the pope ! '
the letter , as i live , with all the business i writ to holiness .
nay then , farewell !
i have touch the highest point of all my greatness , and , from that full meridian of my glory , i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation m the evening , and no man see me more .
to cardinal wolsey , norfolk and suffolk , surrey , and the chamberlain hear the king pleasure , cardinal who commands you to render up the great seal presently into our hands , and to confine yourself to asher house , my lord of winchester , till you hear further from his highness .
stay where your commission , lords ?
words can not carry authority so weighty .
who dare cross , bearing the king will from his mouth expressly ?
till i find more than will or words to do it , i mean your malice , know , officious lords , i dare and must deny it .
now i feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded , envy how eagerly ye follow my disgraces , as if it fed ye !
and how sleek and wanton ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin !
follow your envious courses , men of malice , you have christian warrant for , and , no doubt , in time will find their fit rewards .
that seal , you ask with such a violence , the king , mine and your master , with his own hand gave me , bade me enjoy it , with the place and honours , during my life , and , to confirm his goodness , tied it by now , who take it ?
the king , that gave it .
it must be himself , then .
thou art a proud traitor , priest .
proud lord , thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so .
thy ambition , thou scarlet sin , robb this bewailing land of noble buckingham , my the heads of all thy brother cardinals , with thee and all thy best parts bound together , weigh not a hair of his .
plague of your policy !
you sent me deputy for ireland , far from his succor , from the king , from all that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him , whilst your great goodness , out of holy pity , absolved him with an axe .
this , and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit , i answer is most false .
the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end , his noble jury and foul cause can witness .
if i loved many words , lord , i should tell you you have as little honesty as honour , that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king , my ever royal master , dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be , and all that love his follies .
by my soul , your long coat , priest , protects you , thou shouldst feel my sword i ' the of thee else .
my lords , can ye endure to hear this arrogance ?
and from this fellow ?
if we live thus tamely , to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet , farewell nobility , let his grace go forward , and dare us with his cap like larks .
all goodness is poison to thy stomach .
yes , that goodness of gleaning all the land wealth into one , into your own hands , cardinal , by extortion , the goodness of your intercepted packets you writ to the pope against the king your goodness , since you provoke me , shall be most notorious .
my lord of norfolk , as you are truly noble , as you respect the common good , the state of our despised nobility , our issues , who , if he live , will scarce be gentlemen , produce the grand sum of his sins , the articles collected from his life .
i startle you worse than the scaring bell , when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms , lord cardinal .
how much , methinks , i could despise this man , but that i am bound in charity against it !
those articles , my lord , are in the king hand but , thus much , they are foul ones .
so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise , when the king knows my truth .
this can not save you i thank my memory , i yet remember some of these articles , and out they shall .
now , if you can blush and cry , ' cardinal , you show a little honesty .
speak on , sir , i dare your worst objections if i blush , it is to see a nobleman want manners .
i had rather want those than my head .
have at you !
first , that , without the king assent or knowledge , you wrought to be a legate , by which power you maim the jurisdiction of all bishops .
then , that in all you writ to rome , or else to foreign princes , et rex meus ' was still inscribed , in which you brought the king to be your servant .
then that , without the knowledge either of king or council , when you went ambassador to the emperor , you made bold to carry into flanders the great seal .
item , you sent a large commission to gregory de cassado , to conclude , without the king will or the state allowance , a league between his highness and ferrara .
that , out of mere ambition , you have caused your holy hat to be stamp on the king coin .
then that you have sent innumerable substance by what means got , i leave to your own conscience to furnish rome , and to prepare the ways you have for dignities , to the mere undoing of all the kingdom .
many more there are , which , since they are of you , and odious , i will not taint my mouth with .
o my lord , press not a falling man too far !
is virtue his faults lie open to the laws , let them , not you , correct him .
my heart weeps to see him so little of his great self .
i forgive him .
lord cardinal , the king further pleasure is , because all those things you have done of late , by your power legatine , within this kingdom , fall into the compass of a praemunire , that therefore such a writ be sued against you , to forfeit all your goods , lands , tenements , chattels , and whatsoever , and to be out of the king protection .
this is my charge .
and so we leave you to your meditations how to live better .
for your stubborn answer about the giving back the great seal to us , the king shall know it , and , no doubt , shall thank you .
so fare you well , my little good lord cardinal .
exeunt all but cardinal wolsey so farewell to the little good you bear me .
farewell !
a long farewell , to all my greatness !
this is the state of man he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes , blossoms , and bears his blushing honours thick upon him , the third day comes a frost , a killing frost , and , when he thinks , good easy man , full surely his greatness is , nips his root , and then he falls , as i do .
i have ventured , like little wanton boys that swim on bladders , this many summers in a sea of glory , but far beyond my depth my pride at length broke under me and now has left me , weary and old with service , to the mercy of a rude stream , that must for ever hide me .
vain pomp and glory of this world , i hate ye i feel my heart new open .
o , how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes ' favours !
there is , betwixt that smile we would aspire to , that sweet aspect of princes , and their ruin , more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls , he falls like lucifer , never to hope again .
enter cromwell , and stands amazed why , how now , cromwell !
i have no power to speak , sir .
what , amazed at my misfortunes ?
can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline ?
nay , an you weep , i am indeed .
how does your grace ?
why , well , never so truly happy , my good cromwell .
i know myself now , and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities , a still and quiet conscience .
the king has cured me , i humbly thank his grace , and from these shoulders , these ruin pillars , out of pity , taken a load would sink a navy , too much honour o , is a burthen , cromwell , is a burthen too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven !
i am glad your grace has made that right use of it .
i hope i have i am able now , methinks , out of a fortitude of soul i feel , to endure more miseries and greater far than my enemies dare offer .
what news abroad ?
the heaviest and the worst is your displeasure with the king .
god bless him !
the next is , that sir thomas more is chosen lord chancellor in your place .
that somewhat sudden but he a learned man .
may he continue long in his highness ' favour , and do justice for truth sake and his conscience , that his bones , when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings , may have a tomb of orphans ' tears wept on em !
what more ?
that cranmer is return with welcome , install lord archbishop of canterbury .
that news indeed .
last , that the lady anne , whom the king hath in secrecy long married , this day was view in open as his queen , going to chapel , and the voice is now only about her coronation .
there was the weight that pull me down .
o cromwell , the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost for ever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours , or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles .
go , get thee from me , cromwell , i am a poor man , unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king , that sun , i pray , may never set !
i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee , some little memory of me will stir him i know his noble nature not to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell , neglect him not , make use now , and provide for thine own future safety .
o my lord , must i , then , leave you ?
must i needs forego so good , so noble and so true a master ?
bear witness , all that have not hearts of iron , with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord .
the king shall have my service but my prayers for ever and for ever shall be yours .
cromwell , i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries , but thou hast forced me , out of thy honest truth , to play the woman .
let dry our eyes and thus far hear me , cromwell , and , when i am forgotten , as i shall be , and sleep in dull cold marble , where no mention of me more must be heard of , say , i taught thee , say , wolsey , that once trod the ways of glory , and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour , found thee a way , out of his wreck , to rise in , a sure and safe one , though thy master miss it .
mark but my fall , and that that ruin me .
cromwell , i charge thee , fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels , how can man , then , the image of his maker , hope to win by it ?
love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee , corruption wins not more than honesty .
still in thy right hand carry gentle peace , to silence envious tongues .
be just , and fear not let all the ends thou at be thy country , thy god , and truth , then if thou , o cromwell , thou a blessed martyr !
serve the king , and , prithee , lead me in there take an inventory of all i have , to the last penny , is the king my robe , and my integrity to heaven , is all i dare now call mine own .
o cromwell , cromwell !
had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king , he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies .
good sir , have patience .
so i have .
farewell the hopes of court !
my hopes in heaven do dwell .
exeunt act iv scene i .
a street in westminster .
enter two gentlemen , meeting one another you well met once again .
so are you .
you come to take your stand here , and behold the lady anne pass from her coronation ?
is all my business .
at our last encounter , the duke of buckingham came from his trial .
is very true but that time offer sorrow , this , general joy .
is well the citizens , i am sure , have shown at full their royal minds as , let have their rights , they are ever forward in celebration of this day with shows , pageants and sights of honour .
never greater , nor , i assure you , better taken , sir .
may i be bold to ask at what that contains , that paper in your hand ?
yes , is the list of those that claim their offices this day by custom of the coronation .
the duke of suffolk is the first , and claims to be , next , the duke of norfolk , he to be earl marshal you may read the rest .
i thank you , sir had i not known those customs , i should have been beholding to your paper .
but , i beseech you , what become of katharine , the princess dowager ?
how goes her business ?
that i can tell you too .
the archbishop of canterbury , accompanied with other learned and reverend fathers of his order , held a late court at dunstable , six miles off from ampthill where the princess lay , to which she was often cited by them , but appear not and , to be short , for not appearance and the king late scruple , by the main assent of all these learned men she was divorced , and the late marriage made of none effect since which she was removed to kimbolton , where she remains now sick .
alas , good lady !
trumpets the trumpets sound stand close , the queen is coming .
hautboys the order of the coronation .
a lively flourish of trumpets .
.
then , two judges .
.
lord chancellor , with the purse and mace before him .
.
choristers , singing .
music .
mayor of london , bearing the mace .
then garter , in his coat of arms , and on his head a gilt copper crown .
.
marquess dorset , bearing a sceptre of gold , on his head a of gold .
with him , surrey , bearing the rod of silver with the dove , crowned with an earl coronet .
collars of ss .
.
suffolk , in his robe of estate , his coronet on his head , bearing a long white wand , as .
with him , norfolk , with the rod of marshalship , a coronet on his head .
collars of ss .
.
a canopy borne by four of the , under it , queen anne in her robe , in her hair richly adorned with pearl , crowned .
on each side her , the bishops of london and winchester .
.
the old duchess of norfolk , in a coronal of gold , wrought with flowers , bearing queen anne train .
.
certain ladies or countesses , with plain circlets of gold without flowers .
they pass over the stage in order and state a royal train , believe me .
these i know who that that bears the sceptre ?
marquess dorset and that the earl of surrey , with the rod .
a bold brave gentleman .
that should be the duke of suffolk ?
is the same .
and that my lord of norfolk ?
yes , heaven bless thee !
looking on queen anne thou hast the sweetest face i ever look on .
sir , as i have a soul , she is an angel , our king has all the indies in his arms , and more and richer , when he strains that lady i can not blame his conscience .
they that bear the cloth of honour over her , are four barons of the .
those men are happy , and so are all are near her .
i take it , she that carries up the train is that old noble lady , duchess of norfolk .
it is , and all the rest are countesses .
their coronets say so .
these are stars indeed , and sometimes falling ones .
no more of that .
exit procession , and then a great flourish of trumpets enter a third gentleman god save you , sir !
where have you been broiling ?
among the crowd i ' the abbey , where a finger could not be wedged in more i am stifled with the mere rankness of their joy .
you saw the ceremony ?
that i did .
how was it ?
well worth the seeing .
good sir , speak it to us .
as well as i am able .
the rich stream of lords and ladies , having brought the queen to a prepared place in the choir , fell off a distance from her , while her grace sat down to rest awhile , some half an hour or so , in a rich chair of state , opposing freely the beauty of her person to the people .
believe me , sir , she is the goodliest woman that ever lay by man which when the people had the full view of , such a noise arose as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest , as loud , and to as many tunes hats , cloaks doublets , i think , flew up , and had their faces been loose , this day they had been lost .
such joy i never saw before .
women , that had not half a week to go , like rams in the old time of war , would shake the press , and make reel before .
no man living could say is my wife ' there , all were woven so strangely in one piece .
but , what follow ?
at length her grace rose , and with modest paces came to the altar , where she kneel , and cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray devoutly .
then rose again and bow her to the people when by the archbishop of canterbury she had all the royal makings of a queen , as holy oil , edward confessor crown , the rod , and bird of peace , and all such emblems laid nobly on her which perform , the choir , with all the choicest music of the kingdom , together sung deum . '
so she parted , and with the same full state paced back again to , where the feast is held .
sir , you must no more call it , that past , for , since the cardinal fell , that title lost is now the king , and call whitehall .
i know it , but is so lately alter , that the old name is fresh about me .
what two reverend bishops were those that went on each side of the queen ?
stokesly and gardiner , the one of winchester , newly preferr from the king secretary , the other , london .
he of winchester is held no great good lover of the archbishop , the virtuous cranmer .
all the land knows that however , yet there is no great breach , when it comes , cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him .
who may that be , i pray you ?
thomas cromwell , a man in much esteem with the king , and truly a worthy friend .
the king has made him master o ' the jewel house , and one , already , of the privy council .
he will deserve more .
yes , without all doubt .
come , gentlemen , ye shall go my way , which is to the court , and there ye shall be my guests something i can command .
as i walk thither , i tell ye more .
you may command us , sir .
exeunt scene ii .
kimbolton .
enter katharine , dowager , sick , led between griffith , her gentleman usher , and patience , her woman how does your grace ?
o griffith , sick to death !
my legs , like loaden branches , bow to the earth , willing to leave their burthen .
reach a chair so , now , methinks , i feel a little ease .
didst thou not tell me , griffith , as thou me , that the great child of honour , cardinal wolsey , was dead ?
yes , madam , but i think your grace , out of the pain you suffer , gave no ear .
prithee , good griffith , tell me how he died if well , he stepp before me , happily for my example .
well , the voice goes , madam for after the stout earl northumberland arrested him at york , and brought him forward , as a man sorely tainted , to his answer , he fell sick suddenly , and grew so ill he could not sit his mule .
alas , poor man !
at last , with easy roads , he came to leicester , lodged in the abbey , where the reverend abbot , with all his covent , honourably received him , to whom he gave these words , ' o , father abbot , an old man , broken with the storms of state , is come to lay his weary bones among ye , give him a little earth for charity ! '
so went to bed , where eagerly his sickness pursued him still and , three nights after this , about the hour of eight , which he himself foretold should be his last , full of repentance , continual meditations , tears , and sorrows , he gave his honours to the world again , his blessed part to heaven , and slept in peace .
so may he rest , his faults lie gently on him !
yet thus far , griffith , give me leave to speak him , and yet with charity .
he was a man of an unbounded stomach , ever ranking himself with princes , one that , by suggestion , tied all the kingdom simony was , his own opinion was his law i ' the presence he would say untruths , and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never , but where he meant to ruin , pitiful his promises were , as he then was , mighty , but his performance , as he is now , nothing of his own body he was ill , and gave the clergy in example .
noble madam , men evil manners live in brass , their virtues we write in water .
may it please your highness to hear me speak his good now ?
yes , good griffith , i were malicious else .
this cardinal , though from an humble stock , undoubtedly was fashion to much honour from his cradle .
he was a scholar , and a ripe and good one , exceeding wise , , and persuading lofty and sour to them that loved him not , but to those men that sought him sweet as summer .
and though he were unsatisfied in getting , which was a sin , yet in bestowing , madam , he was most princely ever witness for him those twins of learning that he raised in you , ipswich and oxford !
one of which fell with him , unwilling to outlive the good that did it , the other , though unfinish , yet so famous , so excellent in art , and still so rising , that christendom shall ever speak his virtue .
his overthrow heap happiness upon him , for then , and not till then , he felt himself , and found the blessedness of being little and , to add greater honours to his age than man could give him , he died fearing god .
after my death i wish no other herald , no other speaker of my living actions , to keep mine honour from corruption , but such an honest chronicler as griffith .
whom i most hated living , thou hast made me , with thy religious truth and modesty , now in his ashes honour peace be with him !
patience , be near me still , and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee .
good griffith , cause the musicians play me that sad note i named my knell , whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to .
sad and solemn music she is asleep good wench , let sit down quiet , for fear we wake her softly , gentle patience .
the vision .
enter , solemnly tripping one after another , six personages , clad in white robes , wearing on their heads garlands of bays , and golden vizards on their faces , branches of bays or palm in their hands .
they first congee unto her , then dance , and , at certain changes , the first two hold a spare garland over her head , at which the other four make reverent curtsies , then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two , who observe the same order in their changes , and holding the garland over her head which done , they deliver the same garland to the last two , who likewise observe the same order at which , as it were by inspiration , she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing , and holdeth up her hands to heaven and so in their dancing vanish , carrying the garland with them .
the music continues spirits of peace , where are ye ?
are ye all gone , and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye ?
madam , we are here .
it is not you i call for saw ye none enter since i slept ?
none , madam .
no ?
saw you not , even now , a blessed troop invite me to a banquet , whose bright faces cast thousand beams upon me , like the sun ?
they promised me eternal happiness , and brought me garlands , griffith , which i feel i am not worthy yet to wear i shall , assuredly .
i am most joyful , madam , such good dreams possess your fancy .
bid the music leave , they are harsh and heavy to me .
music ceases do you note how much her grace is alter on the sudden ?
how long her face is drawn ?
how pale she looks , and of an earthy cold ?
mark her eyes !
she is going , wench pray , pray .
heaven comfort her !
enter a messenger a like your grace , you are a saucy fellow deserve we no more reverence ?
you are to blame , knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness , to use so rude behavior , go to , kneel .
i humbly do entreat your highness ' pardon , my haste made me unmannerly .
there is staying a gentleman , sent from the king , to see you .
admit him entrance , griffith but this fellow let me see again .
exeunt griffith and messenger griffith , with capucius if my sight fail not , you should be lord ambassador from the emperor , my royal nephew , and your name capucius .
madam , the same , your servant .
o , my lord , the times and titles now are alter strangely with me since first you knew me .
but , i pray you , what is your pleasure with me ?
noble lady , first mine own service to your grace , the next , the king request that i would visit you , who grieves much for your weakness , and by me sends you his princely commendations , and heartily entreats you take good comfort .
o my good lord , that comfort comes too late , is like a pardon after execution that gentle physic , given in time , had cured me , but now i am past an comforts here , but prayers .
how does his highness ?
madam , in good health .
so may he ever do !
and ever flourish , when i shal l dwell with worms , and my poor name banish the kingdom !
patience , is that letter , i caused you write , yet sent away ?
no , madam .
giving it to katharine sir , i most humbly pray you to deliver this to my lord the king .
most willing , madam .
in which i have commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves , his young daughter , the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her !
beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding she is young , and of a noble modest nature , i hope she will deserve well , and a little to love her for her mother sake , that loved him , heaven knows how dearly .
my next poor petition is , that his noble grace would have some pity upon my wretched women , that so long have follow both my fortunes faithfully of which there is not one , i dare avow , and now i should not lie , but will deserve for virtue and true beauty of the soul , for honesty and decent carriage , a right good husband , let him be a noble and , sure , those men are happy that shall have .
the last is , for my men , they are the poorest , but poverty could never draw from me , that they may have their wages duly paid , and something over to remember me by if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life and able means , we had not parted thus .
these are the whole contents and , good my lord , by that you love the dearest in this world , as you wish christian peace to souls departed , stand these poor people friend , and urge the king to do me this last right .
by heaven , i will , or let me lose the fashion of a man !
i thank you , honest lord .
remember me in all humility unto his highness say his long trouble now is passing out of this world , tell him , in death i bless him , for so i will .
mine eyes grow dim .
farewell , my lord .
griffith , farewell .
nay , patience , you must not leave me yet i must to bed , call in more women .
when i am dead , good wench , let me be used with honour strew me over with maiden flowers , that all the world may know i was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me , then lay me forth although unqueen , yet like a queen , and daughter to a king , inter me .
i can no more .

as for cromwell , beside that of the jewel house , is made master o ' the rolls , and the king secretary , further , sir , stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments , with which the time will load him .
the archbishop is the king hand and tongue , and who dare speak one syllable against him ?
yes , yes , sir thomas , there are that dare , and i myself have ventured to speak my mind of him and indeed this day , sir , i may tell it you , i think i have incensed the lords o ' the council , that he is , for so i know he is , they know he is , a most arch heretic , a pestilence that does infect the land with which they moved have broken with the king , who hath so far given ear to our complaint , of his great grace and princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs our reasons laid before him , hath commanded morning to the he be convented .

what manner of man are you ?
my lord , i look you would have given me your petition , that i should have some pains to bring together yourself and your accusers , and to have heard you , without indurance , further .
most dread liege , the good i stand on is my truth and honesty if they shall fail , i , with mine enemies , will triumph my person , which i weigh not , being of those virtues vacant .
i fear nothing what can be said against me .
know you not how your state stands i ' the world , with the whole world ?
your enemies are many , and not small , their practises must bear the same proportion , and not ever the justice and the truth o ' the question carries the due o ' the verdict with it at what ease might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt to swear against you ?
such things have been done .
you are potently opposed , and with a malice of as great size .
ween you of better luck , i mean , in perjured witness , than your master , whose minister you are , whiles here he lived upon this naughty earth ?
go to , go to , you take a precipice for no leap of danger , and woo your own destruction .
god and your majesty protect mine innocence , or i fall into the trap is laid for me !
be of good cheer , they shall no more prevail than we give way to .
keep comfort to you , and this morning see you do appear before them if they shall chance , in charging you with matters , to commit you , the best persuasions to the contrary fail not to use , and with what vehemency the occasion shall instruct you if entreaties will render you no remedy , this ring deliver them , and your appeal to us there make before them .

i am glad i came this way so happily the king shall understand it presently .
exit aside butts , the king physician as he pass along , how earnestly he cast his eyes upon me !
pray heaven , he sound not my disgrace !
for certain , this is of purpose laid by some that hate me god turn their hearts !
i never sought their malice to quench mine honour they would shame to make me wait else at door , a , boys , grooms , and lackeys .
but their pleasures must be fulfill , and i attend with patience .
enter the king henry viii and doctor butts at a window above i show your grace the strangest sight what that , butts ?
i think your highness saw this many a day .
body o ' me , where is it ?
there , my lord the high promotion of his grace of canterbury , who holds his state at door , pursuivants , pages , and footboys .
ha !
is he , indeed is this the honour they do one another ?
is well there one above yet .
i had thought they had parted so much honesty among at least , good manners , as not thus to suffer a man of his place , and so near our favour , to dance attendance on their lordships ' pleasures , and at the door too , like a post with packets .
by holy mary , butts , there knavery let alone , and draw the curtain close we shall hear more anon .

yes .
who waits there ?
without , my noble lords ?
yes .
my lord archbishop , and has done half an hour , to know your pleasures .
let him come in .
your grace may enter now .
cranmer enters and approaches the my good lord archbishop , i very sorry to sit here at this present , and behold that chair stand empty but we all are men , in our own natures frail , and capable of our flesh , few are angels out of which frailty and want of wisdom , you , that best should teach us , have misdemean yourself , and not a little , toward the king first , then his laws , in filling the whole realm , by your teaching and your chaplains , for so we are inform , with new opinions , divers and dangerous , which are heresies , and , not reform , may prove pernicious .
which reformation must be sudden too , my noble lords , for those that tame wild horses pace not in their hands to make gentle , but stop their mouths with stubborn bits , and spur , till they obey the manage .
if we suffer , out of our easiness and childish pity to one man honour , this contagious sickness , farewell all physic and what follows then ?
commotions , uproars , with a general taint of the whole state as , of late days , our neighbours , the upper germany , can dearly witness , yet freshly pitied in our memories .
my good lords , hitherto , in all the progress both of my life and office , i have labour , and with no little study , that my teaching and the strong course of my authority might go one way , and safely , and the end was ever , to do well nor is there living , i speak it with a single heart , my lords , a man that more detests , more stirs against , both in his private conscience and his place , defacers of a public peace , than i do .
pray heaven , the king may never find a heart with less allegiance in it !
men that make envy and crooked malice nourishment dare bite the best .
i do beseech your lordships , that , in this case of justice , my accusers , be what they will , may stand forth face to face , and freely urge against me .
nay , my lord , that can not be you are a counsellor , and , by that virtue , no man dare accuse you .
my lord , because we have business of more moment , we will be short with you .
is his highness ' pleasure , and our consent , for better trial of you , from hence you be committed to the tower , where , being but a private man again , you shall know many dare accuse you boldly , more than , i fear , you are provided for .
ah , my good lord of winchester , i thank you , you are always my good friend , if your will pass , i shall both find your lordship judge and juror , you are so merciful i see your end , is my undoing love and meekness , lord , become a churchman better than ambition win straying souls with modesty again , cast none away .
that i shall clear myself , lay all the weight ye can upon my patience , i make as little doubt , as you do conscience in doing daily wrongs .
i could say more , but reverence to your calling makes me modest .
my lord , my lord , you are a sectary , that the plain truth your painted gloss discovers , to men that understand you , words and weakness .
my lord of winchester , you are a little , by your good favour , too sharp , men so noble , however faulty , yet should find respect for what they have been is a cruelty to load a falling man .
good master secretary , i cry your honour mercy , you may , worst of all this table , say so .
why , my lord ?
do not i know you for a favourer of this new sect ?
ye are not sound .
not sound ?
not sound , i say .
would you were half so honest !
men prayers then would seek you , not their fears .
i shall remember this bold language .
do .
remember your bold life too .
this is too much , forbear , for shame , my lords .
i have done .
and i .
then thus for you , my lord it stands agreed , i take it , by all voices , that forthwith you be convey to the tower a prisoner , there to remain till the king further pleasure be known unto us are you all agreed , lords ?
we are .
is there no other way of mercy , but i must needs to the tower , my lords ?
what other would you expect ?
you are strangely troublesome .
let some o ' the guard be ready there .
enter guard for me ?
must i go like a traitor thither ?
receive him , and see him safe i ' the tower .
stay , good my lords , i have a little yet to say .
look there , my lords , by virtue of that ring , i take my cause out of the gripes of cruel men , and give it to a most noble judge , the king my master .
this is the king ring .
is no counterfeit .
is the right ring , by heaven i told ye all , when ye first put this dangerous stone , fall upon ourselves .
do you think , my lords , the king will suffer but the little finger of this man to be vex ?
is now too certain how much more is his life in value with him ?
would i were fairly out o !
my mind gave me , in seeking tales and informations against this man , whose honesty the devil and his disciples only envy at , ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at ye !
enter king , frowning on them , takes his seat dread sovereign , how much are we bound to heaven in daily thanks , that gave us such a prince , not only good and wise , but most religious one that , in all obedience , makes the church the chief aim of his honour , and , to strengthen that holy duty , out of dear respect , his royal self in judgment comes to hear the cause betwixt her and this great offender .
you were ever good at sudden commendations , bishop of winchester .
but know , i come not to hear such flattery now , and in my presence , they are too thin and bare to hide offences .
to me you can not reach , you play the spaniel , and think with wagging of your tongue to win me , but , thou takest me for , i sure thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody .
to cranmer good man , sit down .
now let me see the proudest he , that dares most , but wag his finger at thee by all that holy , he had better starve than but once think this place becomes thee not .
may it please your grace , no , sir , it does not please me .
i had thought i had had men of some understanding and wisdom of my council , but i find none .
was it discretion , lords , to let this man , this good man , few of you deserve that title , this honest man , wait like a lousy footboy at chamber door ?
and one as great as you are ?
why , what a shame was this !
did my commission bid ye so far forget yourselves ?
i gave ye power as he was a counsellor to try him , not as a groom there some of ye , i see , more out of malice than integrity , would try him to the utmost , had ye mean , which ye shall never have while i live .
thus far , my most dread sovereign , may it like your grace to let my tongue excuse all .
what was purposed concerning his imprisonment , was rather , if there be faith in men , meant for his trial , and fair purgation to the world , than malice , i sure , in me .
well , well , my lords , respect him , take him , and use him well , he worthy of it .
i will say thus much for him , if a prince may be beholding to a subject , i am , for his love and service , so to him .
make me no more ado , but all embrace him be friends , for shame , my lords !
my lord of canterbury , i have a suit which you must not deny me , that is , a fair young maid that yet wants baptism , you must be godfather , and answer for her .
the greatest monarch now alive may glory in such an honour how may i deserve it that am a poor and humble subject to you ?
come , come , my lord , spare your spoons you shall have two noble partners with you , the old duchess of norfolk , and lady marquess dorset will these please you ?
once more , my lord of winchester , i charge you , embrace and love this man .
with a true heart and i do it .
and let heaven witness , how dear i hold this confirmation .
good man , those joyful tears show thy true heart the common voice , i see , is verified of thee , which says thus , my lord of canterbury a shrewd turn , and he is your friend for ever . '
come , lords , we trifle time away , i long to have this young one made a christian .
as i have made ye one , lords , one remain , so i grow stronger , you more honour gain .
exeunt scene iv .
the palace yard .
noise and tumult within .
enter porter and his man you leave your noise anon , ye rascals do you take the court for ?
ye rude slaves , leave your gaping .
within good master porter , i belong to the larder .
belong to the gallows , and be hanged , ye rogue !
is this a place to roar in ?
fetch me a dozen staves , and strong ones these are but switches to .
i scratch your heads you must be seeing christenings ?
do you look for ale and cakes here , you rude rascals ?
pray , sir , be patient is as much impossible unless we sweep from the door with cannons to scatter , as is to make sleep on morning , which will never be we may as well push against powle , as stir em .
how got they in , and be hang ?
alas , i know not , how gets the tide in ?
as much as one sound cudgel of four foot you see the poor remainder could distribute , i made no spare , sir .
you did nothing , sir .
i am not samson , nor sir guy , nor colbrand , to mow down before me but if i spared any that had a head to hit , either young or old , he or she , cuckold or , let me hope to see a chine again and that i would not for a cow , god save her !
within do you hear , master porter ?
i shall be with you presently , good master puppy .
keep the door close , sirrah .
what would you have me do ?
what should you do , but knock down by the dozens ?
is this moorfields to muster in ?
or have we some strange indian with the great tool come to court , the women so besiege us ?
bless me , what a fry of fornication is at door !
on my christian conscience , this one christening will beget a thousand , here will be father , godfather , and all together .
the spoons will be the bigger , sir .
there is a fellow somewhat near the door , he should be a brazier by his face , for , o ' my conscience , twenty of the now reign in nose , all that stand about him are under the line , they need no other penance that did i hit three times on the head , and three times was his nose discharged against me , he stands there , like a , to blow us .
there was a haberdasher wife of small wit near him , that railed upon me till her pinked porringer fell off her head , for kindling such a combustion in the state .
i missed the meteor once , and hit that woman , who cried out ! '
when i might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succor , which were the hope o ' the strand , where she was quartered .
they fell on , i made good my place at length they came to the to me , i defied still when suddenly a file of boys behind , loose shot , delivered such a shower of pebbles , that i was fain to draw mine honour in , and let win the work the devil was amongst , i think , surely .
these are the youths that thunder at a playhouse , and fight for bitten apples , that no audience , but the tribulation of , or the limbs of limehouse , their dear brothers , are able to endure .
i have some of in limbo patrum , and there they are like to dance these three days , besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come .
enter chamberlain mercy o ' me , what a multitude are here !
they grow still too , from all parts they are coming , as if we kept a fair here !
where are these porters , these lazy knaves ?
ye have made a fine hand , fellows there a trim rabble let in are all these your faithful friends o ' the suburbs ?
we shall have great store of room , no doubt , left for the ladies , when they pass back from the christening .
a please your honour , we are but men , and what so many may do , not being torn , we have done an army can not rule .
as i live , if the king blame me , i lay ye all by the heels , and suddenly , and on your heads clap round fines for neglect ye are lazy knaves , and here ye lie baiting of bombards , when ye should do service .
hark !
the trumpets sound , they come already from the christening go , break among the press , and find a way out to let the troop pass fairly , or i find a marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months .
make way there for the princess .
you great fellow , stand close up , or i make your head ache .
you i ' the camlet , get up o ' the rail , i peck you the pales else .
exeunt scene the palace .
enter trumpets , sounding , then two aldermen , lord mayor , garter , cranmer , norfolk with his marshal staff , suffolk , two noblemen bearing great for the , then four noblemen bearing a canopy , under which the duchess of norfolk , godmother , bearing the child richly habited in a mantle , and , train borne by a lady , then follows the marchioness dorset , the other godmother , and ladies .
the troop pass once about the stage , and garter speaks heaven , from thy endless goodness , send prosperous life , long , and ever happy , to the high and mighty princess of england , elizabeth !
flourish .
enter king henry viii and guard kneeling and to your royal grace , and the good queen , my noble partners , and myself , thus pray all comfort , joy , in this most gracious lady , heaven ever laid up to make parents happy , may hourly fall upon ye !
thank you , good lord archbishop what is her name ?
elizabeth .
stand up , lord .
king henry viii kisses the child with this kiss take my blessing god protect thee !
into whose hand i give thy life .
amen .
my noble gossips , ye have been too prodigal i thank ye heartily , so shall this lady , when she has so much english .
let me speak , sir , for heaven now bids me , and the words i utter let none think flattery , for they find truth .
this royal infant heaven still move about her ! though in her cradle , yet now promises upon this land a thousand thousand blessings , which time shall bring to ripeness she shall be but few now living can behold that goodness a pattern to all princes living with her , and all that shall succeed saba was never more covetous of wisdom and fair virtue than this pure soul shall be all princely graces , that mould up such a mighty piece as this is , with all the virtues that attend the good , shall still be doubled on her truth shall nurse her , holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her she shall be loved and fear her own shall bless her , her foes shake like a field of beaten corn , and hang their heads with sorrow good grows with her in her days every man shall eat in safety , under his own vine , what he plants , and sing the merry songs of peace to all his neighbours god shall be truly known , and those about her from her shall read the perfect ways of honour , and by those claim their greatness , not by blood .
nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when the bird of wonder dies , the maiden phoenix , her ashes new create another heir , as great in admiration as herself , so shall she leave her blessedness to one , when heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness , who from the sacred ashes of her honour shall rise , as great in fame as she was , and so stand fix peace , plenty , love , truth , terror , that were the servants to this chosen infant , shall then be his , and like a vine grow to him wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine , his honour and the greatness of his name shall be , and make new nations he shall flourish , and , like a mountain cedar , reach his branches to all the plains about him our children children shall see this , and bless heaven .
thou speakest wonders .
she shall be , to the happiness of england , an aged princess , many days shall see her , and yet no day without a deed to crown it .
would i had known no more !
but she must die , she must , the saints must have her , yet a virgin , a most unspotted lily shall she pass to the ground , and all the world shall mourn her .
o lord archbishop , thou hast made me now a man !
never , before this happy child , did i get any thing this oracle of comfort has so pleased me , that when i am in heaven i shall desire to see what this child does , and praise my maker .
i thank ye all .
to you , my good lord mayor , and your good brethren , i am much beholding , i have received much honour by your presence , and ye shall find me thankful .
lead the way , lords ye must all see the queen , and she must thank ye , she will be sick else .
this day , no man think has business at his house , for all shall stay this little one shall make it holiday .
exeunt epilogue is ten to one this play can never please all that are here some come to take their ease , and sleep an act or two , but those , we fear , we have frighted with our trumpets , so , is clear , they say is naught others , to hear the city abused extremely , and to cry witty ! '
which we have not done neither that , i fear , all the expected good we like to hear for this play at this time , is only in the merciful construction of good women , for such a one we show if they smile , and say do , i know , within a while all the best men are ours , for is ill hap , if they hold when their ladies bid clap .
act i scene i .
king john palace .
enter king john , queen elinor , pembroke , essex , salisbury , and others , with chatillon now , say , chatillon , what would france with us ?
thus , after greeting , speaks the king of france in my behavior to the majesty , the borrow majesty , of england here .
a strange beginning majesty ! '
silence , good mother , hear the embassy .
philip of france , in right and true behalf of thy deceased brother geffrey son , arthur plantagenet , lays most lawful claim to this fair island and the territories , to ireland , poictiers , anjou , touraine , maine , desiring thee to lay aside the sword which sways usurpingly these several titles , and put these same into young arthur hand , thy nephew and right royal sovereign .
what follows if we disallow of this ?
the proud control of fierce and bloody war , to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld .
here have we war for war and blood for blood , controlment for controlment so answer france .
then take my king defiance from my mouth , the farthest limit of my embassy .
bear mine to him , and so depart in peace be thou as lightning in the eyes of france , for ere thou canst report i will be there , the thunder of my cannon shall be heard so hence !
be thou the trumpet of our wrath and sullen presage of your own decay .
an honourable conduct let him have pembroke , look to .
farewell , chatillon .
exeunt chatillon and pembroke what now , my son !
have i not ever said how that ambitious constance would not cease till she had kindled france and all the world , upon the right and party of her son ?
this might have been prevented and made whole with very easy arguments of love , which now the manage of two kingdoms must with fearful bloody issue arbitrate .
our strong possession and our right for us .
your strong possession much more than your right , or else it must go wrong with you and me so much my conscience whispers in your ear , which none but heaven and you and i shall hear .
enter a sheriff my liege , here is the strangest controversy come from country to be judged by you , that i heard shall i produce the men ?
let them approach .
our abbeys and our priories shall pay this expedition charge .
enter robert and the bastard what men are you ?
your faithful subject i , a gentleman born in northamptonshire and eldest son , as i suppose , to robert faulconbridge , a soldier , by the hand of knighted in the field .
what art thou ?
the son and heir to that same faulconbridge .
is that the elder , and art thou the heir ?
you came not of one mother then , it seems .
most certain of one mother , mighty king , that is well known , and , as i think , one father but for the certain knowledge of that truth i put you to heaven and to my mother of that i doubt , as all men children may .
out on thee , rude man !
thou dost shame thy mother and wound her honour with this diffidence .
i , madam ?
no , i have no reason for it , that is my brother plea and none of mine , the which if he can prove , a ' pops me out at least from fair five hundred pound a year heaven guard my mother honour and my land !
a good blunt fellow .
why , being younger born , doth he lay claim to thine inheritance ?
i know not why , except to get the land .
but once he slander me with bastardy but whether i be as true begot or no , that still i lay upon my mother head , but that i am as well begot , my liege , fair fall the bones that took the pains for me ! compare our faces and be judge yourself .
if old sir robert did beget us both and were our father and this son like him , o old sir robert , father , on my knee i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee !
why , what a madcap hath heaven lent us here !
he hath a trick of face , the accent of his tongue affecteth him .
do you not read some tokens of my son in the large composition of this man ?
mine eye hath well examined his parts and finds them perfect richard .
sirrah , speak , what doth move you to claim your brother land ?
because he hath a , like my father .
with half that face would he have all my land a groat five hundred pound a year !
my gracious liege , when that my father lived , your brother did employ my father much , well , sir , by this you can not get my land your tale must be how he employ my mother .
and once dispatch him in an embassy to germany , there with the emperor to treat of high affairs touching that time .
the advantage of his absence took the king and in the mean time sojourn at my father , where how he did prevail i shame to speak , but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores between my father and my mother lay , as i have heard my father speak himself , when this same lusty gentleman was got .
upon his he by will bequeath his lands to me , and took it on his death that this my mother son was none of his , and if he were , he came into the world full fourteen weeks before the course of time .
then , good my liege , let me have what is mine , my father land , as was my father will .
sirrah , your brother is legitimate , your father wife did after wedlock bear him , and if she did play false , the fault was hers , which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands that marry wives .
tell me , how if my brother , who , as you say , took pains to get this son , had of your father claim this son for his ?
in sooth , good friend , your father might have kept this calf bred from his cow from all the world , in sooth he might , then , if he were my brother , my brother might not claim him , nor your father , being none of his , refuse him this concludes , my mother son did get your father heir , your father heir must have your father land .
shall then my father will be of no force to dispossess that child which is not his ?
of no more force to dispossess me , sir , than was his will to get me , as i think .
whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge and like thy brother , to enjoy thy land , or the reputed son of , lord of thy presence and no land beside ?
madam , an if my brother had my shape , and i had his , sir robert his , like him , and if my legs were two such , my arms such stuff , my face so thin that in mine ear i durst not stick a rose lest men should say , where goes ! '
and , to his shape , were heir to all this land , would i might never stir from off this place , i would give it every foot to have this face , i would not be sir nob in any case .
i like thee well wilt thou forsake thy fortune , bequeath thy land to him and follow me ?
i am a soldier and now bound to france .
brother , take you my land , i take my chance .
your face hath got five hundred pound a year , yet sell your face for five pence and is dear .
madam , i follow you unto the death .
nay , i would have you go before me thither .
our country manners give our betters way .
what is thy name ?
philip , my liege , so is my name begun , philip , good old sir robert wife eldest son .
from henceforth bear his name whose form thou kneel thou down philip , but rise more great , arise sir richard and plantagenet .
brother by the mother side , give me your hand my father gave me honour , yours gave land .
now blessed by the hour , by night or day , when i was got , sir robert was away !
the very spirit of plantagenet !
i am thy grandam , richard , call me so .
madam , by chance but not by truth , what though ?
something about , a little from the right , in at the window , or else the hatch who dares not stir by day must walk by night , and have is have , however men do catch near or far off , well won is still well shot , and i am i , i was begot .
go , faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire , a landless knight makes thee a landed squire .
come , madam , and come , richard , we must speed for france , for france , for it is more than need .
brother , adieu good fortune come to thee !
for thou wast got i ' the way of honesty .
exeunt all but bastard a foot of honour better than i was , but many a many foot of land the worse .
well , now can i make any joan a lady .
den , sir richard ! '
, fellow ! '
and if his name be george , i call him peter , for honour doth forget men names , is too respective and too sociable for your conversion .
now your traveller , he and his toothpick at my worship mess , and when my knightly stomach is sufficed , why then i suck my teeth and catechise my picked man of countries dear sir , ' thus , leaning on mine elbow , i begin , ' i shall beseech you ' that is question now , and then comes answer like an absey book ' o sir , ' says answer , your best command , at your employment , at your service , sir , ' , sir , ' says question , ' i , sweet sir , at yours ' and so , ere answer knows what question would , saving in dialogue of compliment , and talking of the alps and apennines , the pyrenean and the river po , it draws toward supper in conclusion so .
but this is worshipful society and fits the mounting spirit like myself , for he is but a bastard to the time that doth not smack of observation , and so am i , whether i smack or no , and not alone in habit and device , exterior form , outward accoutrement , but from the inward motion to deliver sweet , sweet , sweet poison for the age tooth which , though i will not practise to deceive , yet , to avoid deceit , i mean to learn , for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising .
but who comes in such haste in ?
what is this ?
hath she no husband that will take pains to blow a horn before her ?
enter lady faulconbridge and gurney o me !
it is my mother .
how now , good lady !
what brings you here to court so hastily ?
where is that slave , thy brother ?
where is he , that holds in chase mine honour up and down ?
my brother robert ?
old sir robert son ?
colbrand the giant , that same mighty man ?
is it sir robert son that you seek so ?
sir robert son !
ay , thou unreverend boy , sir robert son why thou at sir robert ?
he is sir robert son , and so art thou .
james gurney , wilt thou give us leave awhile ?
good leave , good philip .
philip !
sparrow james , there toys abroad anon i tell thee more .
exit gurney madam , i was not old sir robert son sir robert might have eat his part in me upon and broke his fast sir robert could do well marry , to confess , could he get me ?
sir robert could not do it we know his handiwork therefore , good mother , to whom am i beholding for these limbs ?
sir robert never holp to make this leg .
hast thou conspired with thy brother too , that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour ?
what means this scorn , thou most untoward knave ?
knight , knight , good mother , .
what !
i am dubb !
i have it on my shoulder .
but , mother , i am not sir robert son , i have disclaim sir robert and my land , legitimation , name and all is gone then , good my mother , let me know my father , some proper man , i hope who was it , mother ?
hast thou denied thyself a faulconbridge ?
as faithfully as i deny the devil .
king richard was thy father by long and vehement suit i was seduced to make room for him in my husband bed heaven lay not my transgression to my charge !
thou art the issue of my dear offence , which was so strongly urged past my defence .
now , by this light , were i to get again , madam , i would not wish a better father .
some sins do bear their privilege on earth , and so doth yours , your fault was not your folly needs must you lay your heart at his dispose , subjected tribute to commanding love , against whose fury and unmatched force the aweless lion could not wage the fight , nor keep his princely heart from richard hand .
he that perforce robs lions of their hearts may easily win a woman .
ay , my mother , with all my heart i thank thee for my father !
who lives and dares but say thou didst not well when i was got , i send his soul to hell .
come , lady , i will show thee to my kin , and they shall say , when richard me begot , if thou hadst said him nay , it had been sin who says it was , he lies , i say was not .
exeunt act ii scene france .
before angiers .
enter austria and forces , drums , etc .
on one side on the other king philip and his power , lewis , arthur , constance and attendants before angiers well met , brave austria .
arthur , that great forerunner of thy blood , richard , that robb the lion of his heart and fought the holy wars in palestine , by this brave duke came early to his grave and for amends to his posterity , at our importance hither is he come , to spread his colours , boy , in thy behalf , and to rebuke the usurpation of thy unnatural uncle , english john embrace him , love him , give him welcome hither .
god shall forgive you death the rather that you give his offspring life , shadowing their right under your wings of war i give you welcome with a powerless hand , but with a heart full of unstained love welcome before the gates of angiers , duke .
a noble boy !
who would not do thee right ?
upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss , as seal to this indenture of my love , that to my home i will no more return , till angiers and the right thou hast in france , together with that pale , that shore , whose foot spurns back the ocean roaring tides and coops from other lands her islanders , even till that england , hedged in with the main , that bulwark , still secure and confident from foreign purposes , even till that utmost corner of the west salute thee for her king till then , fair boy , will i not think of home , but follow arms .
o , take his mother thanks , a widow thanks , till your strong hand shall help to give him strength to make a more requital to your love !
the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords in such a just and charitable war .
well then , to work our cannon shall be bent against the brows of this resisting town .
call for our chiefest men of discipline , to cull the plots of best advantages we lay before this town our royal bones , wade to the in frenchmen blood , but we will make it subject to this boy .
stay for an answer to your embassy , lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood my lord chatillon may from england bring , that right in peace which here we urge in war , and then we shall repent each drop of blood that hot rash haste so indirectly shed .
enter chatillon a wonder , lady !
lo , upon thy wish , our messenger chatillon is arrived !
what england says , say briefly , gentle lord , we coldly pause for thee , chatillon , speak .
then turn your forces from this paltry siege and stir them up against a mightier task .
england , impatient of your just demands , hath put himself in arms the adverse winds , whose leisure i have stay , have given him time to land his legions all as soon as i , his marches are expedient to this town , his forces strong , his soldiers confident .
with him along is come the , an ate , stirring him to blood and strife , with her her niece , the lady blanch of spain , with them a bastard of the king deceased , and all the unsettled humours of the land , rash , inconsiderate , fiery voluntaries , with ladies ' faces and fierce dragons ' spleens , have sold their fortunes at their native homes , bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs , to make hazard of new fortunes here in brief , a braver choice of dauntless spirits than now the english bottoms have waft did nearer float upon the swelling tide , to do offence and scath in christendom .
drum beats the interruption of their churlish drums cuts off more circumstance they are at hand , to parley or to fight , therefore prepare .
how much unlook for is this expedition !
by how much unexpected , by so much we must awake endavour for defence , for courage mounteth with occasion let them be welcome then we are prepared .
enter king john , queen elinor , blanch , the bastard , lords , and forces peace be to france , if france in peace permit our just and lineal entrance to our own , if not , bleed france , and peace ascend to heaven , whiles we , god wrathful agent , do correct their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven .
peace be to england , if that war return from france to england , there to live in peace .
england we love , and for that england sake with burden of our armour here we sweat .
this toil of ours should be a work of thine , but thou from loving england art so far , that thou hast his lawful king cut off the sequence of posterity , infant state and done a rape upon the maiden virtue of the crown .
look here upon thy brother geffrey face , these eyes , these brows , were moulded out of his this little abstract doth contain that large which died in geffrey , and the hand of time shall draw this brief into as huge a volume .
that geffrey was thy elder brother born , and this his son , england was geffrey right and this is geffrey in the name of god how comes it then that thou art call a king , when living blood doth in these temples beat , which owe the crown that thou ?
from whom hast thou this great commission , france , to draw my answer from thy articles ?
from that supernal judge , that stirs good thoughts in any breast of strong authority , to look into the blots and stains of right that judge hath made me guardian to this boy under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong and by whose help i mean to chastise it .
alack , thou dost usurp authority .
excuse , it is to beat usurping down .
who is it thou dost call usurper , france ?
let me make answer , thy usurping son .

a will !
a wicked will a woman will , a canker grandam will !
peace , lady !
pause , or be more temperate it ill beseems this presence to cry aim to these repetitions .
some trumpet summon hither to the walls these men of angiers let us hear them speak whose title they admit , arthur or john .
trumpet sounds .
enter certain citizens upon the walls who is it that hath warn us to the walls ?
is france , for england .
england , for itself .
you men of angiers , and my loving subjects you loving men of angiers , arthur subjects , our trumpet call you to this gentle parle for our advantage , therefore hear us first .
these flags of france , that are advanced here before the eye and prospect of your town , have hither march to your endamagement the cannons have their bowels full of wrath , and ready mounted are they to spit forth their iron indignation your walls all preparation for a bloody siege all merciless proceeding by these french confronts your city eyes , your winking gates , and but for our approach those sleeping stones , that as a waist doth girdle you about , by the compulsion of their ordinance by this time from their fixed beds of lime had been dishabited , and wide havoc made for bloody power to rush upon your peace .
but on the sight of us your lawful king , who painfully with much expedient march have brought a countercheque before your gates , to save unscratch your city threatened cheeks , behold , the french amazed vouchsafe a parle , and now , instead of bullets wrapp in fire , to make a shaking fever in your walls , they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke , to make a faithless error in your ears which trust accordingly , kind citizens , and let us in , your king , whose labour spirits , forwearied in this action of swift speed , crave harbourage within your city walls .
when i have said , make answer to us both .
lo , in this right hand , whose protection is most divinely vow upon the right of him it holds , stands young plantagenet , son to the elder brother of this man , and king him and all that he enjoys for this equity , we tread in warlike march these greens before your town , being no further enemy to you than the constraint of hospitable zeal in the relief of this oppressed child religiously provokes .
be pleased then to pay that duty which you truly owe to that owes it , namely this young prince and then our arms , like to a muzzled bear , save in aspect , hath all offence seal up , our cannons ' malice vainly shall be spent against the invulnerable clouds of heaven , and with a blessed and unvex retire , with unhack swords and helmets all unbruised , we will bear home that lusty blood again which here we came to spout against your town , and leave your children , wives and you in peace .
but if you fondly pass our proffer offer , is not the roundure of your walls can hide you from our messengers of war , though all these english and their discipline were harbour in their rude circumference .
then tell us , shall your city call us lord , in that behalf which we have challenged it ?
or shall we give the signal to our rage and stalk in blood to our possession ?
in brief , we are the king of england subjects for him , and in his right , we hold this town .
acknowledge then the king , and let me in .
that can we not , but he that proves the king , to him will we prove loyal till that time have we ramm up our gates against the world .
doth not the crown of england prove the king ?
and if not that , i bring you witnesses , twice fifteen thousand hearts of england breed , bastards , and else .
to verify our title with their lives .
as many and as bloods as those , some bastards too .
stand in his face to contradict his claim .
till you compound whose right is worthiest , we for the worthiest hold the right from both .
then god forgive the sin of all those souls that to their everlasting residence , before the dew of evening fall , shall fleet , in dreadful trial of our kingdom king !
amen , amen !
mount , chevaliers !
to arms !
saint george , that swinged the dragon , and since sits on his horseback at mine hostess ' door , teach us some fence !
to austria sirrah , were i at home , at your den , sirrah , with your lioness i would set an to your lion hide , and make a monster of you .
peace !
no more .
o tremble , for you hear the lion roar .
up higher to the plain , where we set forth in best appointment all our regiments .
speed then , to take advantage of the field .
it shall be so , and at the other hill command the rest to stand .
god and our right !
exeunt here after excursions , enter the herald of france , with trumpets , to the gates you men of angiers , open wide your gates , and let young arthur , duke of bretagne , in , who by the hand of france this day hath made much work for tears in many an english mother , whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground , many a widow husband grovelling lies , coldly embracing the discolour earth , and victory , with little loss , doth play upon the dancing banners of the french , who are at hand , triumphantly display , to enter conquerors and to proclaim arthur of bretagne england king and yours .
enter english herald , with trumpet rejoice , you men of angiers , ring your bells king john , your king and england doth approach , commander of this hot malicious day their armours , that march hence so , hither return all gilt with frenchmen blood , there stuck no plume in any english crest that is removed by a staff of france , our colours do return in those same hands that did display them when we first march forth , and , like a troop of jolly huntsmen , come our lusty english , all with purpled hands , dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes open your gates and gives the victors way .
heralds , from off our towers we might behold , from first to last , the onset and retire of both your armies , whose equality by our best eyes can not be censured blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows , strength match with strength , and power confronted power both are alike , and both alike we like .
one must prove greatest while they weigh so even , we hold our town for neither , yet for both .
king john and king philip , with their powers , severally france , hast thou yet more blood to cast away ?
say , shall the current of our right run on ?
whose passage , vex with thy impediment , shall leave his native channel and with course disturb even thy confining shores , unless thou let his silver water keep a peaceful progress to the ocean .
england , thou hast not saved one drop of blood , in this hot trial , more than we of france , rather , lost more .
and by this hand i swear , that sways the earth this climate overlooks , before we will lay down our arms , we put thee down , whom these arms we bear , or add a royal number to the dead , gracing the scroll that tells of this war loss with slaughter coupled to the name of kings .
ha , majesty !
how high thy glory towers , when the rich blood of kings is set on fire !
o , now doth death line his dead chaps with steel , the swords of soldiers are his teeth , his fangs , and now he feasts , mousing the flesh of men , in undetermined differences of kings .
why stand these royal fronts amazed thus ?
cry , ! '
kings , back to the stained field , you equal potents , fiery kindled spirits !
then let confusion of one part confirm the other peace till then , blows , blood and death !
whose party do the townsmen yet admit ?
speak , citizens , for england , who your king ?
the king of england , when we know the king .
know him in us , that here hold up his right .
in us , that are our own great deputy and bear possession of our person here , lord of our presence , angiers , and of you .
a greater power then we denies all this , and till it be undoubted , we do lock our former scruple in our gates , king of our fears , until our fears , resolved , be by some certain king purged and deposed .
by heaven , these scroyles of angiers flout you , kings , and stand securely on their battlements , as in a theatre , whence they gape and point at your industrious scenes and acts of death .
your royal presences be ruled by me do like the mutines of jerusalem , be friends awhile and both conjointly bend your sharpest deeds of malice on this town by east and west let france and england mount their battering cannon charged to the mouths , till their clamours have brawl down the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city play incessantly upon these jades , even till unfenced desolation leave them as naked as the vulgar air .
that done , dissever your united strengths , and part your mingled colours once again , turn face to face and bloody point to point , then , in a moment , fortune shall cull forth out of one side her happy minion , to whom in favour she shall give the day , and kiss him with a glorious victory .
how like you this wild counsel , mighty states ?
smacks it not something of the policy ?
now , by the sky that hangs above our heads , i like it well .
france , shall we knit our powers and lay this angiers even to the ground , then after fight who shall be king of it ?
an if thou hast the mettle of a king , being wronged as we are by this peevish town , turn thou the mouth of thy artillery , as we will ours , against these saucy walls , and when that we have dash them to the ground , why then defy each other and make work upon ourselves , for heaven or hell .
let it be so .
say , where will you assault ?
we from the west will send destruction into this city bosom .
i from the north .
our thunder from the south shall rain their drift of bullets on this town .
o prudent discipline !
from north to south austria and france shoot in each other mouth i stir them to it .
come , away , away !
hear us , great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay , and i shall show you peace and league , win you this city without stroke or wound , rescue those breathing lives to die in beds , that here come sacrifices for the field persever not , but hear me , mighty kings .
speak on with favour , we are bent to hear .
that daughter there of spain , the lady blanch , is niece to england look upon the years of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid if lusty love should go in quest of beauty , where should he find it fairer than in blanch ?
if zealous love should go in search of virtue , where should he find it purer than in blanch ?
if love ambitious sought a match of birth , whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch ?
such as she is , in beauty , virtue , birth , is the young dauphin every way complete if not complete of , say he is not she , and she again wants nothing , to name want , if want it be not that she is not he he is the half part of a blessed man , left to be finished by such as she , and she a fair divided excellence , whose fulness of perfection lies in him .
o , two such silver currents , when they join , do glorify the banks that bound them in , and two such shores to two such streams made one , two such controlling bounds shall you be , kings , to these two princes , if you marry them .
this union shall do more than battery can to our gates , for at this match , with swifter spleen than powder can enforce , the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope , and give you entrance but without this match , the sea enraged is not half so deaf , lions more confident , mountains and rocks more free from motion , no , not death himself in moral fury half so peremptory , as we to keep this city .
here a stay that shakes the rotten carcass of old death out of his rags !
here a large mouth , indeed , that spits forth death and mountains , rocks and seas , talks as familiarly of roaring lions as maids of thirteen do of !
what cannoneer begot this lusty blood ?
he speaks plain cannon fire , and smoke and bounce , he gives the bastinado with his tongue our ears are cudgell , not a word of his but buffets better than a fist of france zounds !
i was never so bethump with words since i first call my brother father dad .
son , list to this conjunction , make this match , give with our niece a dowry large enough for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie thy now unsured assurance to the crown , that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit .
i see a yielding in the looks of france , mark , how they whisper urge them while their souls are capable of this ambition , lest zeal , now melted by the windy breath of soft petitions , pity and remorse , cool and congeal again to what it was .
why answer not the double majesties this friendly treaty of our threaten town ?
speak england first , that hath been forward first to speak unto this city what say you ?
if that the dauphin there , thy princely son , can in this book of beauty read ' i love , ' her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen for anjou and fair touraine , maine , poictiers , and all that we upon this side the sea , except this city now by us besieged , find liable to our crown and dignity , shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich in titles , honours and promotions , as she in beauty , education , blood , holds hand with any princess of the world .
what thou , boy ?
look in the lady face .
i do , my lord , and in her eye i find a wonder , or a wondrous miracle , the shadow of myself form in her eye which being but the shadow of your son , becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow i do protest i never loved myself till now infixed i beheld myself drawn in the flattering table of her eye .
whispers with blanch drawn in the flattering table of her eye !
hang in the frowning wrinkle of her brow !
and quarter in her heart !
he doth espy himself love traitor this is pity now , that hang and drawn and quartered , there should be in such a love so vile a lout as he .
my uncle will in this respect is mine if he see aught in you that makes him like , that any thing he sees , which moves his liking , i can with ease translate it to my will , or if you will , to speak more properly , i will enforce it easily to my love .
further i will not flatter you , my lord , that all i see in you is worthy love , than this , that nothing do i see in you , though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge , that i can find should merit any hate .
what say these young ones ?
what say you my niece ?
that she is bound in honour still to do what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say .
speak then , prince dauphin , can you love this lady ?
nay , ask me if i can refrain from love , for i do love her most unfeignedly .
then do i give volquessen , touraine , maine , poictiers and anjou , these five provinces , with her to thee , and this addition more , full thirty thousand marks of english coin .
philip of france , if thou be pleased withal , command thy son and daughter to join hands .
it likes us well , young princes , close your hands .
and your lips too , for i am well assured that i did so when i was first assured .
now , citizens of angiers , ope your gates , let in that amity which you have made , for at saint mary chapel presently the rites of marriage shall be solemnized .
is not the lady constance in this troop ?
i know she is not , for this match made up her presence would have interrupted much where is she and her son ?
tell me , who knows .
she is sad and passionate at your highness ' tent .
and , by my faith , this league that we have made will give her sadness very little cure .
brother of england , how may we content this widow lady ?
in her right we came , which we , god knows , have turn another way , to our own vantage .
we will heal up all , for we create young arthur duke of bretagne and earl of richmond , and this rich fair town we make him lord of .
call the lady constance , some speedy messenger bid her repair to our solemnity i trust we shall , if not fill up the measure of her will , yet in some measure satisfy her so that we shall stop her exclamation .
go we , as well as haste will suffer us , to this unlook for , unprepared pomp .
exeunt all but the bastard mad world !
mad kings !
mad composition !
john , to stop arthur title in the whole , hath willingly departed with a part , and france , whose armour conscience buckled on , whom zeal and charity brought to the field as god own soldier , rounded in the ear with that same , that sly devil , that broker , that still breaks the pate of faith , that daily , he that wins of all , of kings , of beggars , old men , young men , maids , who , having no external thing to lose but the word , ' cheats the poor maid of that , that gentleman , tickling commodity , commodity , the bias of the world , the world , who of itself is peised well , made to run even upon even ground , till this advantage , this bias , this sway of motion , this commodity , makes it take head from all indifferency , from all direction , purpose , course , intent and this same bias , this commodity , this bawd , this broker , this word , clapp on the outward eye of fickle france , hath drawn him from his own determined aid , from a resolved and honourable war , to a most base and peace .
and why rail i on this commodity ?
but for because he hath not woo me yet not that i have the power to clutch my hand , when his fair angels would salute my palm , but for my hand , as unattempted yet , like a poor beggar , raileth on the rich .
well , whiles i am a beggar , i will rail and say there is no sin but to be rich , and being rich , my virtue then shall be to say there is no vice but beggary .
since kings break faith upon commodity , gain , be my lord , for i will worship thee .
exit act iii scene i .
the french king pavilion .
enter constance , arthur , and salisbury gone to be married !
gone to swear a peace !
false blood to false blood join !
gone to be friends !
shall lewis have blanch , and blanch those provinces ?
it is not so , thou hast misspoke , misheard be well advised , tell thy tale again it can not be , thou dost but say is so i trust i may not trust thee , for thy word is but the vain breath of a common man believe me , i do not believe thee , man , i have a king oath to the contrary .
thou shalt be punish for thus frighting me , for i am sick and capable of fears , oppress with wrongs and therefore full of fears , a widow , husbandless , subject to fears , a woman , naturally born to fears , and though thou now confess thou didst but jest , with my vex spirits i can not take a truce , but they will quake and tremble all this day .
what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head ?
why dost thou look so sadly on my son ?
what means that hand upon that breast of thine ?
why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum , like a proud river peering his bounds ?
be these sad signs confirmers of thy words ?
then speak again , not all thy former tale , but this one word , whether thy tale be true .
as true as i believe you think them false that give you cause to prove my saying true .
o , if thou teach me to believe this sorrow , teach thou this sorrow how to make me die , and let belief and life encounter so as doth the fury of two desperate men which in the very meeting fall and die .
lewis marry blanch !
o boy , then where art thou ?
france friend with england , what becomes of me ?
fellow , be gone i can not brook thy sight this news hath made thee a most ugly man .
what other harm have i , good lady , done , but spoke the harm that is by others done ?
which harm within itself so heinous is as it makes harmful all that speak of it .
i do beseech you , madam , be content .
if thou , that me be content , wert grim , ugly and slanderous to thy mother womb , full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains , lame , foolish , crooked , swart , prodigious , patch with foul moles and marks , i would not care , i then would be content , for then i should not love thee , no , nor thou become thy great birth nor deserve a crown .
but thou art fair , and at thy birth , dear boy , nature and fortune join to make thee great of nature gifts thou mayst with lilies boast , and with the rose .
but fortune , o , she is corrupted , changed and won from thee , she adulterates hourly with thine uncle john , and with her golden hand hath pluck on france to tread down fair respect of sovereignty , and made his majesty the bawd to theirs .
france is a bawd to fortune and king john , that strumpet fortune , that usurping john !
tell me , thou fellow , is not france forsworn ?
envenom him with words , or get thee gone and leave those woes alone which i alone am bound to .
pardon me , madam , i may not go without you to the kings .
thou mayst , thou shalt , i will not go with thee i will instruct my sorrows to be proud , for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop .
to me and to the state of my great grief let kings assemble , for my grief so great that no supporter but the huge firm earth can hold it up here i and sorrows sit , here is my throne , bid kings come bow to it .
seats herself on the ground enter king john , king phillip , lewis , blanch , queen elinor , the bastard , austria , and attendants is true , fair daughter , and this blessed day ever in france shall be kept festival to solemnize this day the glorious sun stays in his course and plays the alchemist , turning with splendor of his precious eye the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold the yearly course that brings this day about shall never see it but a holiday .
a wicked day , and not a holy day !
rising what hath this day deserved ?
what hath it done , that it in golden letters should be set among the high tides in the calendar ?
nay , rather turn this day out of the week , this day of shame , oppression , perjury .
or , if it must stand still , let wives with child pray that their burthens may not fall this day , lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross but on this day let seamen fear no wreck , no bargains break that are not this day made this day , all things begun come to ill end , yea , faith itself to hollow falsehood change !
by heaven , lady , you shall have no cause to curse the fair proceedings of this day have i not pawn to you my majesty ?
you have beguiled me with a counterfeit resembling majesty , which , being touch and tried , proves valueless you are forsworn , forsworn , you came in arms to spill mine enemies ' blood , but now in arms you strengthen it with yours the grappling vigour and rough frown of war is cold in amity and painted peace , and our oppression hath made up this league .
arm , arm , you heavens , against these perjured kings !
a widow cries , be husband to me , heavens !
let not the hours of this ungodly day wear out the day in peace , but , ere sunset , set armed discord these perjured kings !
hear me , o , hear me !
lady constance , peace !
war !
war !
no peace !
peace is to me a war o lymoges !
o austria !
thou dost shame that bloody spoil thou slave , thou wretch , thou coward !
thou little valiant , great in villany !
thou ever strong upon the stronger side !
thou fortune champion that dost never fight but when her humorous ladyship is by to teach thee safety !
thou art perjured too , and soothest up greatness .
what a fool art thou , a ramping fool , to brag and stamp and swear upon my party !
thou slave , hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side , been sworn my soldier , bidding me depend upon thy stars , thy fortune and thy strength , and dost thou now fall over to my fores ?
thou wear a lion hide !
doff it for shame , and hang a on those recreant limbs .
o , that a man should speak those words to me !
and hang a on those recreant limbs .
thou darest not say so , villain , for thy life .
and hang a on those recreant limbs .
we like not this , thou dost forget thyself .
enter cardinal pandulph here comes the holy legate of the pope .
hail , you anointed deputies of heaven !
to thee , king john , my holy errand is .
i pandulph , of fair milan cardinal , and from pope innocent the legate here , do in his name religiously demand why thou against the church , our holy mother , so wilfully dost spurn , and force perforce keep stephen langton , chosen archbishop of canterbury , from that holy see ?
this , in our foresaid holy father name , pope innocent , i do demand of thee .
what earthy name to interrogatories can task the free breath of a sacred king ?
thou canst not , cardinal , devise a name so slight , unworthy and ridiculous , to charge me to an answer , as the pope .
tell him this tale , and from the mouth of england add thus much more , that no italian priest shall tithe or toll in our dominions , but as we , under heaven , are supreme head , so under him that great supremacy , where we do reign , we will alone uphold , without the assistance of a mortal hand so tell the pope , all reverence set apart to him and his usurp authority .
brother of england , you blaspheme in this .
though you and all the kings of christendom are led so grossly by this meddling priest , dreading the curse that money may buy out , and by the merit of vile gold , dross , dust , purchase corrupted pardon of a man , who in that sale sells pardon from himself , though you and all the rest so grossly led this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish , yet i alone , alone do me oppose against the pope and count his friends my foes .
then , by the lawful power that i have , thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate .
and blessed shall he be that doth revolt from his allegiance to an heretic , and meritorious shall that hand be call , canonized and worshipped as a saint , that takes away by any secret course thy hateful life .
o , lawful let it be that i have room with rome to curse awhile !
good father cardinal , cry thou amen to my keen curses , for without my wrong there is no tongue hath power to curse him right .
there law and warrant , lady , for my curse .
and for mine too when law can do no right , let it be lawful that law bar no wrong law can not give my child his kingdom here , for he that holds his kingdom holds the law , therefore , since law itself is perfect wrong , how can the law forbid my tongue to curse ?
philip of france , on peril of a curse , let go the hand of that , and raise the power of france upon his head , unless he do submit himself to rome .
thou pale , france ?
do not let go thy hand .
look to that , devil , lest that france repent , and by disjoining hands , hell lose a soul .
king philip , listen to the cardinal .
and hang a on his recreant limbs .
well , ruffian , i must pocket up these wrongs , because your breeches best may carry them .
philip , what thou to the cardinal ?
what should he say , but as the cardinal ?
bethink you , father , for the difference is purchase of a heavy curse from rome , or the light loss of england for a friend forego the easier .
that the curse of rome .
o lewis , stand fast !
the devil tempts thee here in likeness of a new untrimmed bride .
the lady constance speaks not from her faith , but from her need .
o , if thou grant my need , which only lives but by the death of faith , that need must needs infer this principle , that faith would live again by death of need .
o then , tread down my need , and faith mounts up , keep my need up , and faith is trodden down !
the king is moved , and answers not to this .
o , be removed from him , and answer well !
do so , king philip , hang no more in doubt .
hang nothing but a , most sweet lout .
i am perplex , and know not what to say .
what canst thou say but will perplex thee more , if thou stand excommunicate and cursed ?
good reverend father , make my person yours , and tell me how you would bestow yourself .
this royal hand and mine are newly knit , and the conjunction of our inward souls married in league , coupled and linked together with all religious strength of sacred vows , the latest breath that gave the sound of words was faith , peace , amity , true love between our kingdoms and our royal selves , and even before this truce , but new before , no longer than we well could wash our hands to clap this royal bargain up of peace , heaven knows , they were besmear and with slaughter pencil , where revenge did paint the fearful difference of incensed kings and shall these hands , so lately purged of blood , so newly join in love , so strong in both , unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet ?
play fast and loose with faith ?
so jest with heaven , make such unconstant children of ourselves , as now again to snatch our palm from palm , unswear faith sworn , and on the of smiling peace to march a bloody host , and make a riot on the gentle brow of true sincerity ?
o , holy sir , my reverend father , let it not be so !
out of your grace , devise , ordain , impose some gentle order , and then we shall be blest to do your pleasure and continue friends .
all form is formless , order orderless , save what is opposite to england love .
therefore to arms !
be champion of our church , or let the church , our mother , breathe her curse , a mother curse , on her revolting son .
france , thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue , a chafed lion by the mortal paw , a fasting tiger safer by the tooth , than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold .
i may disjoin my hand , but not my faith .
so makest thou faith an enemy to faith , and like a civil war oath to oath , thy tongue against thy tongue .
o , let thy vow first made to heaven , first be to heaven perform , that is , to be the champion of our church !
what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself and may not be performed by thyself , for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done , and being not done , where doing tends to ill , the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again , though indirect , yet indirection thereby grows direct , and falsehood falsehood cures , as fire cools fire within the scorched veins of one .
it is religion that doth make vows kept , but thou hast sworn against religion , by what thou against the thing thou , and makest an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear , swears only not to be forsworn , else what a mockery should it be to swear !
but thou dost swear only to be forsworn , and most forsworn , to keep what thou dost swear .
therefore thy later vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself , and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts against these giddy loose suggestions upon which better part our prayers come in , if thou vouchsafe them .
but if not , then know the peril of our curses light on thee so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off , but in despair die under their black weight .
rebellion , flat rebellion !
not be ?
will not a stop that mouth of thine ?
father , to arms !
upon thy ?
against the blood that thou hast married ?
what , shall our feast be kept with slaughter men ?
shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums , clamours of hell , be measures to our pomp ?
o husband , hear me !
ay , alack , how new is husband in my mouth !
even for that name , which till this time my tongue did pronounce , upon my knee i beg , go not to arms against mine uncle .

farewell , gentle cousin .
coz , farewell .
exit the bastard come hither , little kinsman , hark , a word .
come hither , hubert .
o my gentle hubert , we owe thee much !
within this wall of flesh there is a soul counts thee her creditor and with advantage means to pay thy love and my good friend , thy voluntary oath lives in this bosom , dearly cherished .
give me thy hand .
i had a thing to say , but i will fit it with some better time .
by heaven , hubert , i am almost ashamed to say what good respect i have of thee .
i am much bounden to your majesty .
good friend , thou hast no cause to say so yet , but thou shalt have , and creep time so slow , yet it shall come from me to do thee good .
i had a thing to say , but let it go the sun is in the heaven , and the proud day , attended with the pleasures of the world , is all too wanton and too full of gawds to give me audience if the midnight bell did , with his iron tongue and brazen mouth , sound on into the drowsy race of night , if this same were a churchyard where we stand , and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs , or if that surly spirit , melancholy , had baked thy blood and made it , which else runs tickling up and down the veins , making that idiot , laughter , keep men eyes and strain their cheeks to idle merriment , a passion hateful to my purposes , or if that thou couldst see me without eyes , hear me without thine ears , and make reply without a tongue , using conceit alone , without eyes , ears and harmful sound of words , then , in despite of brooded watchful day , i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts but , ah , i will not !
yet i love thee well , and , by my troth , i think thou lovest me well .
so well , that what you bid me undertake , though that my death were adjunct to my act , by heaven , i would do it .
do not i know thou wouldst ?
good hubert , hubert , hubert , throw thine eye on yon young boy i tell thee what , my friend , he is a very serpent in my way , and this foot of mine doth tread , he lies before me dost thou understand me ?
thou art his keeper .
and i keep him so , that he shall not offend your majesty .
death .
my lord ?
a grave .
he shall not live .
enough .
i could be merry now .
hubert , i love thee , well , i not say what i intend for thee remember .
madam , fare you well i send those powers to your majesty .
my blessing go with thee !
for england , cousin , go hubert shall be your man , attend on you with all true duty .
on toward calais , ho !
exeunt scene iv .

king philip tent .
enter king philip , lewis , cardinal pandulph , and attendants so , by a roaring tempest on the flood , a whole armado of convicted sail is scatter and disjoin from fellowship .
courage and comfort !
all shall yet go well .
what can go well , when we have run so ill ?
are we not beaten ?
is not angiers lost ?
arthur prisoner ?
divers dear friends slain ?
and bloody england into england gone , interruption , spite of france ?
what he hath won , that hath he fortified so hot a speed with such advice disposed , such temperate order in so fierce a cause , doth want example who hath read or heard of any kindred action like to this ?
well could i bear that england had this praise , so we could find some pattern of our shame .
enter constance look , who comes here !
a grave unto a soul , holding the eternal spirit against her will , in the vile prison of afflicted breath .
i prithee , lady , go away with me .
lo , now i now see the issue of your peace .
patience , good lady !
comfort , gentle constance !
no , i defy all counsel , all redress , but that which ends all counsel , true redress , death , death , o amiable lovely death !
thou odouriferous stench !
sound rottenness !
arise forth from the couch of lasting night , thou hate and terror to prosperity , and i will kiss thy detestable bones and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows and ring these fingers with thy household worms and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust and be a carrion monster like thyself come , grin on me , and i will think thou smilest and buss thee as thy wife .
misery love , o , come to me !
o fair affliction , peace !
no , no , i will not , having breath to cry o , that my tongue were in the thunder mouth !
then with a passion would i shake the world , and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy which can not hear a lady feeble voice , which scorns a modern invocation .
lady , you utter madness , and not sorrow .
thou art not holy to belie me so , i am not mad this hair i tear is mine , my name is constance , i was geffrey wife , young arthur is my son , and he is lost i am not mad i would to heaven i were !
for then , is like i should forget myself o , if i could , what grief should i forget !
preach some philosophy to make me mad , and thou shalt be canonized , cardinal , for being not mad but sensible of grief , my reasonable part produces reason how i may be deliver of these woes , and teaches me to kill or hang myself if i were mad , i should forget my son , or madly think a babe of clouts were he i am not mad , too well , too well i feel the different plague of each calamity .
bind up those tresses .
o , what love i note in the fair multitude of those her hairs !
where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen , even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends do glue themselves in sociable grief , like true , inseparable , faithful loves , sticking together in calamity .
to england , if you will .
bind up your hairs .
yes , that i will , and wherefore will i do it ?
i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud ' o that these hands could so redeem my son , as they have given these hairs their liberty ! '
but now i envy at their liberty , and will again commit them to their bonds , because my poor child is a prisoner .
and , father cardinal , i have heard you say that we shall see and know our friends in heaven if that be true , i shall see my boy again , for since the birth of cain , the first male child , to him that did but yesterday suspire , there was not such a gracious creature born .
but now will eat my bud and chase the native beauty from his cheek and he will look as hollow as a ghost , as dim and meagre as an ague fit , and so he die , and , rising so again , when i shall meet him in the court of heaven i shall not know him therefore never , never must i behold my pretty arthur more .
you hold too heinous a respect of grief .
he talks to me that never had a son .
you are as fond of grief as of your child .
grief fills the room up of my absent child , lies in his bed , walks up and down with me , puts on his pretty looks , repeats his words , remembers me of all his gracious parts , stuffs out his vacant garments with his form , then , have i reason to be fond of grief ?
fare you well had you such a loss as i , i could give better comfort than you do .
i will not keep this form upon my head , when there is such disorder in my wit .
o lord !
my boy , my arthur , my fair son !
my life , my joy , my food , my all the world !
my , and my sorrows ' cure !
exit i fear some outrage , and i follow her .
exit there nothing in this world can make me joy life is as tedious as a tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man , and bitter shame hath spoil the sweet world taste that it yields nought but shame and bitterness .
before the curing of a strong disease , even in the instant of repair and health , the fit is strongest , evils that take leave , on their departure most of all show evil what have you lost by losing of this day ?
all days of glory , joy and happiness .
if you had won it , certainly you had .
no , no , when fortune means to men most good , she looks upon them with a threatening eye .
is strange to think how much king john hath lost in this which he accounts so clearly won are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner ?
as heartily as he is glad he hath him .
your mind is all as youthful as your blood .
now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit , for even the breath of what i mean to speak shall blow each dust , each straw , each little rub , out of the path which shall directly lead thy foot to england throne , and therefore mark .
john hath seized arthur , and it can not be that , whiles warm life plays in that infant veins , the misplaced john should entertain an hour , one minute , nay , one quiet breath of rest .
a sceptre snatch with an unruly hand must be as boisterously maintain as gain , and he that stands upon a slippery place makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up that john may stand , then arthur needs must fall , so be it , for it can not be but so .
but what shall i gain by young arthur fall ?
you , in the right of lady blanch your wife , may then make all the claim that arthur did .
and lose it , life and all , as arthur did .
how green you are and fresh in this old world !
john lays you plots , the times conspire with you , for he that steeps his safety in true blood shall find but bloody safety and untrue .
this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts of all his people and freeze up their zeal , that none so small advantage shall step forth to cheque his reign , but they will cherish it , no natural exhalation in the sky , no scope of nature , no distemper day , no common wind , no customed event , but they will pluck away his natural cause and call them meteors , prodigies and signs , abortives , presages and tongues of heaven , plainly denouncing vengeance upon john .
may be he will not touch young arthur life , but hold himself safe in his prisonment .
o , sir , when he shall hear of your approach , if that young arthur be not gone already , even at that news he dies , and then the hearts of all his people shall revolt from him and kiss the lips of unacquainted change and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath out of the bloody fingers ' ends of john .
methinks i see this hurly all on foot and , o , what better matter breeds for you than i have named !
the bastard faulconbridge is now in england , ransacking the church , offending charity if but a dozen french were there in arms , they would be as a call to train ten thousand english to their side , or as a little snow , tumbled about , anon becomes a mountain .
o noble dauphin , go with me to the king is wonderful what may be wrought out of their discontent , now that their souls are topful of offence .
for england go i will whet on the king .
strong reasons make strong actions let us go if you say ay , the king will not say no .
exeunt act iv scene i .
a room in a castle .
enter hubert and executioners heat me these irons hot , and look thou stand within the arras when i strike my foot upon the bosom of the ground , rush forth , and bind the boy which you shall find with me fast to the chair be heedful hence , and watch .
i hope your warrant will bear out the deed .
uncleanly scruples !
fear not you look .
exeunt executioners young lad , come forth , i have to say with you .
enter arthur good morrow , hubert .
good morrow , little prince .
as little prince , having so great a title to be more prince , as may be .
you are sad .
indeed , i have been merrier .
mercy on me !
methinks no body should be sad but i yet , i remember , when i was in france , young gentlemen would be as sad as night , only for wantonness .
by my christendom , so i were out of prison and kept sheep , i should be as merry as the day is long , and so i would be here , but that i doubt my uncle practises more harm to me he is afraid of me and i of him is it my fault that i was geffrey son ?
no , indeed , not , and i would to heaven i were your son , so you would love me , hubert .
aside if i talk to him , with his innocent prate he will awake my mercy which lies dead therefore i will be sudden and dispatch .
are you sick , hubert ?
you look pale in sooth , i would you were a little sick , that i might sit all night and watch with you i warrant i love you more than you do me .
aside his words do take possession of my bosom .
read here , young arthur .
showing a paper aside how now , foolish rheum !
turning dispiteous torture out of door !
i must be brief , lest resolution drop out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears .
can you not read it ?
is it not fair writ ?
too fairly , hubert , for so foul effect must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes ?
young boy , i must .
and will you ?
and i will .
have you the heart ?
when your head did but ache , i knit my handercher about your brows , the best i had , a princess wrought it me , and i did never ask it you again , and with my hand at midnight held your head , and like the watchful minutes to the hour , still and anon cheer up the heavy time , saying , lack you ? '
and lies your grief ? '
or good love may i perform for you ? '
many a poor man son would have lien still and have spoke a loving word to you , but you at your sick service had a prince .
nay , you may think my love was crafty love and call it cunning do , an if you will if heaven be pleased that you must use me ill , why then you must .
will you put out mine eyes ?
these eyes that never did nor never shall so much as frown on you .
i have sworn to do it , and with hot irons must i burn them out .
ah , none but in this iron age would do it !
the iron of itself , though heat , approaching near these eyes , would drink my tears and quench his fiery indignation even in the matter of mine innocence , nay , after that , consume away in rust but for containing fire to harm mine eye .
are you more than hammer iron ?
an if an angel should have come to me and told me hubert should put out mine eyes , i would not have believed him , no tongue but hubert .
come forth .
stamps executioners , with a cord , irons , and c do as i bid you do .
o , save me , hubert , save me !
my eyes are out even with the fierce looks of these bloody men .
give me the iron , i say , and bind him here .
alas , what need you be so ?
i will not struggle , i will stand .
for heaven sake , hubert , let me not be bound !
nay , hear me , hubert , drive these men away , and i will sit as quiet as a lamb , i will not stir , nor wince , nor speak a word , nor look upon the iron angerly thrust but these men away , and i forgive you , whatever torment you do put me to .
go , stand within , let me alone with him .
i am best pleased to be from such a deed .
exeunt executioners alas , i then have chid away my friend !
he hath a stern look , but a gentle heart let him come back , that his compassion may give life to yours .
come , boy , prepare yourself .
is there no remedy ?
none , but to lose your eyes .
o heaven , that there were but a mote in yours , a grain , a dust , a gnat , a wandering hair , any annoyance in that precious sense !
then feeling what small things are boisterous there , your vile intent must needs seem horrible .
is this your promise ?
go to , hold your tongue .
hubert , the utterance of a brace of tongues must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes let me not hold my tongue , let me not , hubert , or , hubert , if you will , cut out my tongue , so i may keep mine eyes o , spare mine eyes .
though to no use but still to look on you !
lo , by my truth , the instrument is cold and would not harm me .
i can heat it , boy .
no , in good sooth the fire is dead with grief , being create for comfort , to be used in undeserved extremes see else yourself , there is no malice in this burning coal , the breath of heaven has blown his spirit out and strew repentent ashes on his head .
but with my breath i can revive it , boy .
an if you do , you will but make it blush and glow with shame of your proceedings , hubert nay , it perchance will sparkle in your eyes , and like a dog that is compell to fight , snatch at his master that doth tarre him on .
all things that you should use to do me wrong deny their office only you do lack that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends , creatures of note for uses .
well , see to live , i will not touch thine eye for all the treasure that thine uncle owes yet am i sworn and i did purpose , boy , with this same very iron to burn them out .
o , now you look like hubert !
all this while you were disguised .
peace , no more .
adieu .
your uncle must not know but you are dead , i fill these dogged spies with false reports and , pretty child , sleep doubtless and secure , that hubert , for the wealth of all the world , will not offend thee .
o heaven !
i thank you , hubert .
silence , no more go closely in with me much danger do i undergo for thee .
exeunt scene ii .
king john palace .
enter king john , pembroke , salisbury , and other lords here once again we sit , once again crown , and looked upon , i hope , with cheerful eyes .
this again , ' but that your highness pleased , was once superfluous you were crown before , and that high royalty was pluck off , the faiths of men stained with revolt , fresh expectation troubled not the land with any change or better state .
therefore , to be possess with double pomp , to guard a title that was rich before , to gild refined gold , to paint the lily , to throw a perfume on the violet , to smooth the ice , or add another hue unto the rainbow , or with to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish , is wasteful and ridiculous excess .
but that your royal pleasure must be done , this act is as an ancient tale new told , and in the last repeating troublesome , being urged at a time unseasonable .
in this the antique and well noted face of plain old form is much disfigured , and , like a shifted wind unto a sail , it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about , startles and frights consideration , makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected , for putting on so new a fashion robe .
when workmen strive to do better than well , they do confound their skill in covetousness , and oftentimes excusing of a fault doth make the fault the worse by the excuse , as patches set upon a little breach discredit more in hiding of the fault than did the fault before it was so patch .
to this effect , before you were new crown , we breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness to overbear it , and we are all well pleased , since all and every part of what we would doth make a stand at what your highness will .
some reasons of this double coronation i have possess you with and think them strong , and more , more strong , then lesser is my fear , i shall indue you with meantime but ask what you would have reform that is not well , and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your requests .
then i , as one that am the tongue of these , to sound the purpose of all their hearts , both for myself and them , but , chief of all , your safety , for the which myself and them bend their best studies , heartily request the enfranchisement of arthur , whose restraint doth move the murmuring lips of discontent to break into this dangerous argument , if what in rest you have in right you hold , why then your fears , which , as they say , attend the steps of wrong , should move you to mew up your tender kinsman and to choke his days with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth the rich advantage of good exercise ?
that the time enemies may not have this to grace occasions , let it be our suit that you have bid us ask his liberty , which for our goods we do no further ask than whereupon our weal , on you depending , counts it your weal he have his liberty .
enter hubert let it be so i do commit his youth to your direction .
hubert , what news with you ?
taking him apart this is the man should do the bloody deed , he show his warrant to a friend of mine the image of a wicked heinous fault lives in his eye , that close aspect of his does show the mood of a much troubled breast , and i do fearfully believe is done , what we so fear he had a charge to do .
the colour of the king doth come and go between his purpose and his conscience , like heralds two dreadful battles set his passion is so ripe , it needs must break .
and when it breaks , i fear will issue thence the foul corruption of a sweet child death .
we can not hold mortality strong hand good lords , although my will to give is living , the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceased .
indeed we fear his sickness was past cure .
indeed we heard how near his death he was before the child himself felt he was sick this must be answer either here or hence .
why do you bend such solemn brows on me ?
think you i bear the shears of destiny ?
have i commandment on the pulse of life ?
it is apparent foul play , and is shame that greatness should so grossly offer it so thrive it in your game !
and so , farewell .
stay yet , lord salisbury , i go with thee , and find the inheritance of this poor child , his little kingdom of a forced grave .
that blood which owed the breadth of all this isle , three foot of it doth hold bad world the while !
this must not be thus borne this will break out to all our sorrows , and ere long i doubt .
exeunt lords they burn in indignation .
i repent there is no sure foundation set on blood , no certain life achieved by others ' death .
enter a messenger a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks ?
so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france ?
from france to england .
never such a power for any foreign preparation was levied in the body of a land .
the copy of your speed is learn by them , for when you should be told they do prepare , the tidings come that they are all arrived .
o , where hath our intelligence been drunk ?
where hath it slept ?
where is my mother care , that such an army could be drawn in france , and she not hear of it ?
my liege , her ear is stopp with dust , the first of april died your noble mother and , as i hear , my lord , the lady constance in a frenzy died three days before but this from rumour tongue i idly heard , if true or false i know not .
withhold thy speed , dreadful occasion !
o , make a league with me , till i have pleased my discontented peers !
what !
mother dead !
how wildly then walks my estate in france !
under whose conduct came those powers of france that thou for truth givest out are landed here ?
under the dauphin .
thou hast made me giddy with these ill tidings .
enter the bastard and peter of pomfret now , what says the world to your proceedings ?
do not seek to stuff my head with more ill news , for it is full .
but if you be afeard to hear the worst , then let the worst unheard fall on your bead .
bear with me cousin , for i was amazed under the tide but now i breathe again aloft the flood , and can give audience to any tongue , speak it of what it will .
how i have sped among the clergymen , the sums i have collected shall express .
but as i travell hither through the land , i find the people strangely fantasied , possess with rumours , full of idle dreams , not knowing what they fear , but full of fear and here a prophet , that i brought with me from forth the streets of pomfret , whom i found with many hundreds treading on his heels , to whom he sung , in rude rhymes , that , ere the next at noon , your highness should deliver up your crown .
thou idle dreamer , wherefore didst thou so ?
foreknowing that the truth will fall out so .
hubert , away with him , imprison him , and on that day at noon whereon he says i shall yield up my crown , let him be hang .
deliver him to safety , and return , for i must use thee .
exeunt hubert with peter o my gentle cousin , thou the news abroad , who are arrived ?
the french , my lord , men mouths are full of it besides , i met lord bigot and lord salisbury , with eyes as red as fire , and others more , going to seek the grave of arthur , who they say is kill on your suggestion .
gentle kinsman , go , and thrust thyself into their companies i have a way to win their loves again , bring them before me .
i will seek them out .
nay , but make haste , the better foot before .
o , let me have no subject enemies , when adverse foreigners affright my towns with dreadful pomp of stout invasion !
be mercury , set feathers to thy heels , and fly like thought from them to me again .
the spirit of the time shall teach me speed .
exit spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman .
go after him , for he perhaps shall need some messenger betwixt me and the peers , and be thou he .
with all my heart , my liege .
exit my mother dead !
hubert my lord , they say five moons were seen , four fixed , and the fifth did whirl about the other four in wondrous motion .
five moons !
old men and beldams in the streets do prophesy upon it dangerously young arthur death is common in their mouths and when they talk of him , they shake their heads and whisper one another in the ear , and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer wrist , whilst he that hears makes fearful action , with wrinkled brows , with nods , with rolling eyes .
i saw a smith stand with his hammer , thus , the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool , with open mouth swallowing a tailor news , who , with his shears and measure in his hand , standing on slippers , which his nimble haste had falsely thrust upon contrary feet , told of a many thousand warlike french that were embattailed and rank in kent another lean unwash artificer cuts off his tale and talks of arthur death .
why thou to possess me with these fears ?
why urgest thou so oft young arthur death ?
thy hand hath murder him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead , but thou hadst none to kill him .
no had , my lord !
why , did you not provoke me ?
it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humours for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life , and on the winking of authority to understand a law , to know the meaning of dangerous majesty , when perchance it frowns more upon humour than advised respect .
here is your hand and seal for what i did .
o , when the last account heaven and earth is to be made , then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation !
how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done !
hadst not thou been by , a fellow by the hand of nature mark , quoted and sign to do a deed of shame , this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorr aspect , finding thee fit for bloody villany , apt , liable to be employ in danger , i faintly broke with thee of arthur death , and thou , to be endeared to a king , made it no conscience to destroy a prince .
my lord hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purposed , or turn an eye of doubt upon my face , as bid me tell my tale in express words , deep shame had struck me dumb , made me break off , and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin , yea , without stop , didst let thy heart consent , and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed , which both our tongues held vile to name .
out of my sight , and never see me more !
my nobles leave me , and my state is braved , even at my gates , with ranks of foreign powers nay , in the body of this fleshly land , this kingdom , this confine of blood and breath , hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin death .
arm you against your other enemies , i make a peace between your soul and you .
young arthur is alive this hand of mine is yet a maiden and an innocent hand , not painted with the crimson spots of blood .
within this bosom never enter yet the dreadful motion of a murderous thought , and you have slander nature in my form , which , howsoever rude exteriorly , is yet the cover of a fairer mind than to be butcher of an innocent child .
doth arthur live ?
o , haste thee to the peers , throw this report on their incensed rage , and make them tame to their obedience !
forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature , for my rage was blind , and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art .
o , answer not , but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste .
i conjure thee but slowly , run more fast .
exeunt scene iii .
before the castle .
enter arthur , on the walls the wall is high , and yet will i leap down good ground , be pitiful and hurt me not !
there few or none do know me if they did , this semblance hath disguised me quite .
i am afraid , and yet i venture it .
if i get down , and do not break my limbs , i find a thousand shifts to get away as good to die and go , as die and stay .
leaps down o me !
my uncle spirit is in these stones heaven take my soul , and england keep my bones !
dies enter pembroke , salisbury , and bigot lords , i will meet him at saint edmundsbury it is our safety , and we must embrace this gentle offer of the perilous time .
who brought that letter from the cardinal ?
the count melun , a noble lord of france , whose private with me of the dauphin love is much more general than these lines import .
morning let us meet him then .
or rather then set forward , for be two long days ' journey , lords , or ere we meet .
enter the bastard once more well met , distemper lords !
the king by me requests your presence straight .
the king hath dispossess himself of us we will not line his thin bestained cloak with our pure honours , nor attend the foot that leaves the print of blood it walks .
return and tell him so we know the worst .
you think , good words , i think , were best .
our griefs , and not our manners , reason now .
but there is little reason in your grief , therefore reason you had manners now .
sir , sir , impatience hath his privilege .
is true , to hurt his master , no man else .
this is the prison .
what is he lies here ?
seeing arthur o death , made proud with pure and princely beauty !
the earth had not a hole to hide this deed .
murder , as hating what himself hath done , doth lay it open to urge on revenge .
or , when he doom this beauty to a grave , found it too for a grave .
sir richard , what think you ?
have you beheld , or have you read or heard ?
or could you think ?
or do you almost think , although you see , that you do see ?
could thought , without this object , form such another ?
this is the very top , the height , the crest , or crest unto the crest , of murder arms this is the bloodiest shame , the wildest savagery , the vilest stroke , that ever wrath or staring rage presented to the tears of soft remorse .
all murders past do stand excused in this and this , so sole and so unmatchable , shall give a holiness , a purity , to the yet unbegotten sin of times , and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest , exampled by this heinous spectacle .
it is a damned and a bloody work , the graceless action of a heavy hand , if that it be the work of any hand .
if that it be the work of any hand !
we had a kind of light what would ensue it is the shameful work of hubert hand , the practise and the purpose of the king from whose obedience i forbid my soul , kneeling before this ruin of sweet life , and breathing to his breathless excellence the incense of a vow , a holy vow , never to taste the pleasures of the world , never to be infected with delight , nor conversant with ease and idleness , till i have set a glory to this hand , by giving it the worship of revenge .
our souls religiously confirm thy words .
enter hubert lords , i am hot with haste in seeking you arthur doth live , the king hath sent for you .
o , he is old and blushes not at death .
avaunt , thou hateful villain , get thee gone !
i am no villain .
must i rob the law ?
drawing his sword your sword is bright , sir , put it up again .
not till i sheathe it in a murderer skin .
stand back , lord salisbury , stand back , i say , by heaven , i think my sword as sharp as yours i would not have you , lord , forget yourself , nor tempt the danger of my true defence , lest i , by marking of your rage , forget your worth , your greatness and nobility .
out , dunghill !
darest thou brave a nobleman ?
not for my life but yet i dare defend my innocent life against an emperor .
thou art a murderer .
do not prove me so , yet i am none whose tongue speaks false , not truly speaks , who speaks not truly , lies .
cut him to pieces .
keep the peace , i say .
stand by , or i shall gall you , faulconbridge .
thou wert better gall the devil , salisbury if thou but frown on me , or stir thy foot , or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame , i strike thee dead .
put up thy sword betime , or i so maul you and your , that you shall think the devil is come from hell .
what wilt thou do , renowned faulconbridge ?
second a villain and a murderer ?
lord bigot , i am none .
who kill this prince ?
is not an hour since i left him well i honour him , i loved him , and will weep my date of life out for his sweet life loss .
trust not those cunning waters of his eyes , for villany is not without such rheum , and he , long traded in it , makes it seem like rivers of remorse and innocency .
away with me , all you whose souls abhor the uncleanly savours of a , for i am stifled with this smell of sin .
away toward bury , to the dauphin there !
there tell the king he may inquire us out .
exeunt lords here a good world !
knew you of this fair work ?
beyond the infinite and boundless reach of mercy , if thou didst this deed of death , art thou damn , hubert .
do but hear me , sir .
ha !
i tell thee what , damn as black nay , nothing is so black , thou art more deep damn than prince lucifer there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell as thou shalt be , if thou didst kill this child .
upon my soul if thou didst but consent to this most cruel act , do but despair , and if thou a cord , the smallest thread that ever spider twisted from her womb will serve to strangle thee , a rush will be a beam to hang thee on , or wouldst thou drown thyself , put but a little water in a spoon , and it shall be as all the ocean , enough to stifle such a villain up .
i do suspect thee very grievously .
if i in act , consent , or sin of thought , be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath which was embounded in this beauteous clay , let hell want pains enough to torture me .
i left him well .
go , bear him in thine arms .
i am amazed , methinks , and lose my way among the thorns and dangers of this world .
how easy dost thou take all england up !
from forth this morsel of dead royalty , the life , the right and truth of all this realm is fled to heaven , and england now is left to tug and scamble and to part by the teeth the unowed interest of state .
now for the bone of majesty doth dogged war bristle his angry crest and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace now powers from home and discontents at home meet in one line , and vast confusion waits , as doth a raven on a beast , the imminent decay of wrested pomp .
now happy he whose cloak and cincture can hold out this tempest .
bear away that child and follow me with speed i to the king a thousand businesses are brief in hand , and heaven itself doth frown upon the land .
exeunt act v scene i .
king john palace .
enter king john , cardinal pandulph , and attendants thus have i yielded up into your hand the circle of my glory .
giving the crown take again from this my hand , as holding of the pope your sovereign greatness and authority .
now keep your holy word go meet the french , and from his holiness use all your power to stop their marches we are inflamed .
our discontented counties do revolt , our people quarrel with obedience , swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood , to foreign royalty .
this inundation of mistemper humour rests by you only to be qualified then pause not , for the present time so sick , that present medicine must be minister , or overthrow incurable ensues .
it was my breath that blew this tempest up , upon your stubborn usage of the pope , but since you are a gentle convertite , my tongue shall hush again this storm of war and make fair weather in your blustering land .
on this , remember well , upon your oath of service to the pope , go i to make the french lay down their arms .
exit is this ?
did not the prophet say that before at noon my crown i should give off ?
even so i have i did suppose it should be on constraint but , heaven be thank , it is but voluntary .
enter the bastard all kent hath yielded , nothing there holds out but dover castle london hath received , like a kind host , the dauphin and his powers your nobles will not hear you , but are gone to offer service to your enemy , and wild amazement hurries up and down the little number of your doubtful friends .
would not my lords return to me again , after they heard young arthur was alive ?
they found him dead and cast into the streets , an empty casket , where the jewel of life by some damn hand was robb and away .
that villain hubert told me he did live .
so , on my soul , he did , for aught he knew .
but wherefore do you droop ?
why look you sad ?
be great in act , as you have been in thought , let not the world see fear and sad distrust govern the motion of a kingly eye be stirring as the time , be fire with fire , threaten the threatener and outface the brow of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes , that borrow their behaviors from the great , grow great by your example and put on the dauntless spirit of resolution .
away , and glister like the god of war , when he intendeth to become the field show boldness and aspiring confidence .
what , shall they seek the lion in his den , and fright him there ?
and make him tremble there ?
o , let it not be said forage , and run to meet displeasure farther from the doors , and grapple with him ere he comes so nigh .
the legate of the pope hath been with me , and i have made a happy peace with him , and he hath promised to dismiss the powers led by the dauphin .
o inglorious league !
shall we , upon the footing of our land , send orders and make compromise , insinuation , parley and base truce to arms invasive ?
shall a beardless boy , a cocker silken wanton , brave our fields , and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil , mocking the air with colours idly spread , and find no cheque ?
let us , my liege , to arms perchance the cardinal can not make your peace , or if he do , let it at least be said they saw we had a purpose of defence .
have thou the ordering of this present time .
away , then , with good courage !
yet , i know , our party may well meet a prouder foe .
exeunt scene ii .
lewis camp at st .
edmundsbury .
enter , in arms , lewis , salisbury , melun , pembroke , bigot , and soldiers my lord melun , let this be copied out , and keep it safe for our remembrance return the precedent to these lords again , that , having our fair order written down , both they and we , perusing these notes , may know wherefore we took the sacrament and keep our faiths firm and inviolable .
upon our sides it never shall be broken .
and , noble dauphin , albeit we swear a voluntary zeal and an unurged faith to your proceedings , yet believe me , prince , i am not glad that such a sore of time should seek a plaster by contemn revolt , and heal the inveterate canker of one wound by making many .
o , it grieves my soul , that i must draw this metal from my side to be a !
o , and there where honourable rescue and defence cries out upon the name of salisbury !
but such is the infection of the time , that , for the health and physic of our right , we can not deal but with the very hand of stern injustice and confused wrong .
and not pity , o my grieved friends , that we , the sons and children of this isle , were born to see so sad an hour as this , wherein we step after a stranger march upon her gentle bosom , and fill up her enemies ' ranks , i must withdraw and weep upon the spot of this enforced cause , to grace the gentry of a land remote , and follow unacquainted colours here ?
what , here ?
o nation , that thou couldst remove !
that neptune arms , who clippeth thee about , would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself , and grapple thee unto a pagan shore , where these two christian armies might combine the blood of malice in a vein of league , and not to spend it so unneighbourly !
a noble temper dost thou show in this , and great affections wrestling in thy bosom doth make an earthquake of nobility .
o , what a noble combat hast thou fought between compulsion and a brave respect !
let me wipe off this honourable dew , that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks my heart hath melted at a lady tears , being an ordinary inundation , but this effusion of such manly drops , this shower , blown up by tempest of the soul , startles mine eyes , and makes me more amazed than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven figured quite with burning meteors .
lift up thy brow , renowned salisbury , and with a great heart heave away the storm commend these waters to those baby eyes that never saw the giant world enraged , nor met with fortune other than at feasts , full of warm blood , of mirth , of gossiping .
come , come , for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep into the purse of rich prosperity as lewis himself so , nobles , shall you all , that knit your sinews to the strength of mine .
and even there , methinks , an angel spake enter cardinal pandulph look , where the holy legate comes apace , to give us warrant from the hand of heaven and on our actions set the name of right with holy breath .
hail , noble prince of france !
the next is this , king john hath reconciled himself to rome , his spirit is come in , that so stood out against the holy church , the great metropolis and see of rome therefore thy threatening colours now wind up , and tame the savage spirit of wild war , that like a lion foster up at hand , it may lie gently at the foot of peace , and be no further harmful than in show .
your grace shall pardon me , i will not back i am too to be propertied , to be a secondary at control , or useful and instrument , to any sovereign state throughout the world .
your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars between this chastised kingdom and myself , and brought in matter that should feed this fire , and now is far too huge to be blown out with that same weak wind which enkindled it .
you taught me how to know the face of right , acquainted me with interest to this land , yea , thrust this enterprise into my heart , and come ye now to tell me john hath made his peace with rome ?
what is that peace to me ?
i , by the honour of my , after young arthur , claim this land for mine , and , now it is , must i back because that john hath made his peace with rome ?
am i rome slave ?
what penny hath rome borne , what men provided , what munition sent , to underprop this action ?
not i that undergo this charge ?
who else but i , and such as to my claim are liable , sweat in this business and maintain this war ?
have i not heard these islanders shout out le roi ! '
as i have bank their towns ?
have i not here the best cards for the game , to win this easy match play for a crown ?
and shall i now give the yielded set ?
no , no , on my soul , it never shall be said .
you look but on the outside of this work .
outside or inside , i will not return till my attempt so much be glorified as to my ample hope was promised before i drew this gallant head of war , and cull these fiery spirits from the world , to outlook conquest and to win renown even in the jaws of danger and of death .
trumpet sounds what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us ?
enter the bastard , attended according to the fair play of the world , let me have audience , i am sent to speak my holy lord of milan , from the king i come , to learn how you have dealt for him , and , as you answer , i do know the scope and warrant limited unto my tongue .
the dauphin is too , and will not temporize with my entreaties , he flatly says he not lay down his arms .
by all the blood that ever fury breathed , the youth says well .
now hear our english king , for thus his royalty doth speak in me .
he is prepared , and reason too he should this apish and unmannerly approach , this harness masque and unadvised revel , this unhair sauciness and boyish troops , the king doth smile at , and is well prepared to whip this dwarfish war , these pigmy arms , from out the circle of his territories .
that hand which had the strength , even at your door , to cudgel you and make you take the hatch , to dive like buckets in concealed wells , to crouch in litter of your stable planks , to lie like pawns lock up in chests and trunks , to hug with swine , to seek sweet safety out in vaults and prisons , and to thrill and shake even at the crying of your nation crow , thinking his voice an armed englishman , shall that victorious hand be feebled here , that in your chambers gave you chastisement ?
no know the gallant monarch is in arms and like an eagle his aery towers , to souse annoyance that comes near his nest .
and you degenerate , you ingrate revolts , you bloody neroes , ripping up the womb of your dear mother england , blush for shame , for your own ladies and maids like amazons come tripping after drums , their thimbles into armed gauntlets change , their needles to lances , and their gentle hearts to fierce and bloody inclination .
there end thy brave , and turn thy face in peace , we grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well , we hold our time too precious to be spent with such a brabbler .
give me leave to speak .
no , i will speak .
we will attend to neither .
strike up the drums , and let the tongue of war plead for our interest and our being here .
indeed your drums , being beaten , will cry out , and so shall you , being beaten do but start an echo with the clamour of thy drum , and even at hand a drum is ready braced that shall reverberate all as loud as thine , sound but another , and another shall as loud as thine rattle the welkin ear and mock the thunder for at hand , not trusting to this halting legate here , whom he hath used rather for sport than need is warlike john , and in his forehead sits a death , whose office is this day to feast upon whole thousands of the french .
strike up our drums , to find this danger out .
and thou shalt find it , dauphin , do not doubt .
exeunt scene iii .
the field of battle .
alarums .
enter king john and hubert how goes the day with us ?
o , tell me , hubert .
badly , i fear .
how fares your majesty ?
this fever , that hath troubled me so long , lies heavy on me , o , my heart is sick !
enter a messenger my lord , your valiant kinsman , faulconbridge , desires your majesty to leave the field and send him word by me which way you go .
tell him , toward swinstead , to the abbey there .
be of good comfort , for the great supply that was expected by the dauphin here , are wreck three nights ago on goodwin sands .
this news was brought to richard but even now the french fight coldly , and retire themselves .
ay me !
this tyrant fever burns me up , and will not let me welcome this good news .
set on toward swinstead to my litter straight , weakness possesseth me , and i am faint .
exeunt scene iv .
another part of the field .
enter salisbury , pembroke , and bigot i did not think the king so stored with friends .
up once again , put spirit in the french if they miscarry , we miscarry too .
that misbegotten devil , faulconbridge , in spite of spite , alone upholds the day .
they say king john sore sick hath left the field .
enter melun , wounded lead me to the revolts of england here .
when we were happy we had other names .
it is the count melun .
wounded to death .
fly , noble english , you are bought and sold , unthread the rude eye of rebellion and welcome home again discarded faith .
seek out king john and fall before his feet , for if the french be lords of this loud day , he means to recompense the pains you take by cutting off your heads thus hath he sworn and i with him , and many moe with me , upon the altar at saint edmundsbury , even on that altar where we swore to you dear amity and everlasting love .
may this be possible ?
may this be true ?
have i not hideous death within my view , retaining but a quantity of life , which bleeds away , even as a form of wax resolveth from his figure the fire ?
what in the world should make me now deceive , since i must lose the use of all deceit ?
why should i then be false , since it is true that i must die here and live hence by truth ?
i say again , if lewis do win the day , he is forsworn , if those eyes of yours behold another day break in the east but even this night , whose black contagious breath already smokes about the burning crest of the old , feeble and sun , even this ill night , your breathing shall expire , paying the fine of rated treachery even with a treacherous fine of all your lives , if lewis by your assistance win the day .
commend me to one hubert with your king the love of him , and this respect besides , for that my grandsire was an englishman , awakes my conscience to confess all this .
in lieu whereof , i pray you , bear me hence from forth the noise and rumour of the field , where i may think the remnant of my thoughts in peace , and part this body and my soul with contemplation and devout desires .
we do believe thee and beshrew my soul but i do love the favour and the form of this most fair occasion , by the which we will untread the steps of damned flight , and like a bated and retired flood , leaving our rankness and irregular course , stoop low within those bounds we have and cabby run on in obedience even to our ocean , to our great king john .
my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence , for i do see the cruel pangs of death right in thine eye .
away , my friends !
new flight , and happy newness , that intends old right .
exeunt , leading off melun scene the french camp .
enter lewis and his train the sun of heaven methought was loath to set , but stay and made the western welkin blush , when english measure backward their own ground in faint retire .
o , bravely came we off , when with a volley of our needless shot , after such bloody toil , we bid good night , and wound our tattering colours clearly up , last in the field , and almost lords of it !
enter a messenger where is my prince , the dauphin ?
here what news ?
the count melun is slain , the english lords by his persuasion are again off , and your supply , which you have wish so long , are cast away and sunk on goodwin sands .
ah , foul shrewd news !
beshrew thy very heart !
i did not think to be so sad as this hath made me .
who was he that said king john did fly an hour or two before the stumbling night did part our weary powers ?
whoever spoke it , it is true , my lord .
well , keep good quarter and good care the day shall not be up so soon as i , to try the fair adventure of .
exeunt scene vi .
an open place in the neighbourhood of swinstead abbey .
enter the bastard and hubert , severally who there ?
speak , ho !
speak quickly , or i shoot .
a friend .
what art thou ?
of the part of england .
whither dost thou go ?
what that to thee ?
why may not i demand of thine affairs , as well as thou of mine ?
hubert , i think ?
thou hast a perfect thought i will upon all hazards well believe thou art my friend , that my tongue so well .
who art thou ?
who thou wilt and if thou please , thou mayst befriend me so much as to think i come one way of the plantagenets .
unkind remembrance !
thou and eyeless night have done me shame brave soldier , pardon me , that any accent breaking from thy tongue should the true acquaintance of mine ear .
come , come , sans compliment , what news abroad ?
why , here walk i in the black brow of night , to find you out .
brief , then , and what the news ?
o , my sweet sir , news fitting to the night , black , fearful , comfortless and horrible .
show me the very wound of this ill news i am no woman , i not swoon at it .
the king , i fear , is poison by a monk i left him almost speechless , and broke out to acquaint you with this evil , that you might the better arm you to the sudden time , than if you had at leisure known of this .
how did he take it ?
who did taste to him ?
a monk , i tell you , a resolved villain , whose bowels suddenly burst out the king yet speaks and peradventure may recover .
who didst thou leave to tend his majesty ?
why , know you not ?
the lords are all come back , and brought prince henry in their company , at whose request the king hath pardon them , and they are all about his majesty .
withhold thine indignation , mighty heaven , and tempt us not to bear above our power !
i tell tree , hubert , half my power this night , passing these flats , are taken by the tide , these lincoln washes have devoured them , myself , well mounted , hardly have escaped .
away before conduct me to the king , i doubt he will be dead or ere i come .
exeunt scene vii .
the orchard in swinstead abbey .
enter prince henry , salisbury , and bigot it is too late the life of all his blood is touch corruptibly , and his pure brain , which some suppose the soul frail , doth by the idle comments that it makes foretell the ending of mortality .
enter pembroke his highness yet doth speak , and holds belief that , being brought into the open air , it would allay the burning quality of that fell poison which assaileth him .
let him be brought into the orchard here .
doth he still rage ?
exit bigot he is more patient than when you left him , even now he sung .
o vanity of sickness !
fierce extremes in their continuance will not feel themselves .
death , having prey upon the outward parts , leaves them invisible , and his siege is now against the mind , the which he pricks and wounds with many legions of strange fantasies , whi ch , in their throng and press to that last hold , confound themselves .
is strange that death should sing .
i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan , who chants a doleful hymn to his own death , and from the of frailty sings his soul and body to their lasting rest .
be of good comfort , prince , for you are born to set a form upon that indigest which he hath left so shapeless and so rude .
enter attendants , and bigot , carrying king john in a chair ay , marry , now my soul hath , it would not out at windows nor at doors .
there is so hot a summer in my bosom , that all my bowels crumble up to dust i am a scribbled form , drawn with a pen upon a parchment , and against this fire do i shrink up .
how fares your majesty ?
poison , ill fare dead , forsook , cast off and none of you will bid the winter come to thrust his icy fingers in my maw , nor let my kingdom rivers take their course through my burn bosom , nor entreat the north to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips and comfort me with cold .
i do not ask you much , i beg cold comfort , and you are so strait and so ingrateful , you deny me that .
o that there were some virtue in my tears , that might relieve you !
the salt in them is hot .
within me is a hell , and there the poison is as a fiend confined to tyrannize on unreprievable condemned blood .
enter the bastard o , i am scalded with my violent motion , and spleen of speed to see your majesty !
o cousin , thou art come to set mine eye the tackle of my heart is crack and burn , and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail are turned to one thread , one little hair my heart hath one poor string to stay it by , which holds but till thy news be uttered , and then all this thou seest is but a clod and module of confounded royalty .
the dauphin is preparing hitherward , where heaven he knows how we shall answer him , for in a night the best part of my power , as i upon advantage did remove , were in the washes all unwarily devoured by the unexpected flood .
king john dies you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear .
my liege !
my lord !
but now a king , now thus .
even so must i run on , and even so stop .
what surety of the world , what hope , what stay , when this was now a king , and now is clay ?
art thou gone so ?
i do but stay behind to do the office for thee of revenge , and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven , as it on earth hath been thy servant still .
now , now , you stars that move in your right spheres , where be your powers ?
show now your mended faiths , and instantly return with me again , to push destruction and perpetual shame out of the weak door of our fainting land .
straight let us seek , or straight we shall be sought , the dauphin rages at our very heels .
it seems you know not , then , so much as we the cardinal pandulph is within at rest , who half an hour since came from the dauphin , and brings from him such offers of our peace as we with honour and respect may take , with purpose presently to leave this war .
he will the rather do it when he sees ourselves well sinewed to our defence .
nay , it is in a manner done already , for many carriages he hath dispatch to the , and put his cause and quarrel to the disposing of the cardinal with whom yourself , myself and other lords , if you think meet , this afternoon will post to consummate this business happily .
let it be so and you , my noble prince , with other princes that may best be spared , shall wait upon your father funeral .
at worcester must his body be interr , for so he will it .
thither shall it then and happily may your sweet self put on the lineal state and glory of the land !
to whom with all submission , on my knee i do bequeath my faithful services and true subjection everlastingly .
and the like tender of our love we make , to rest without a spot for evermore .
i have a kind soul that would give you thanks and knows not how to do it but with tears .
o , let us pay the time but needful woe , since it hath been beforehand with our griefs .
this england never did , nor never shall , lie at the proud foot of a conqueror , but when it first did help to wound itself .
now these her princes are come home again , come the three corners of the world in arms , and we shall shock them .
nought shall make us rue , if england to itself do rest but true .

what !
know you not , being mechanical , you ought not walk upon a labouring day without the sign of your profession ?
speak , what trade art thou ?
why , sir , a carpenter .
where is thy leather apron and thy rule ?
what dost thou with thy best apparel on ?
you , sir , what trade are you ?
truly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , i am but , as you would say , a cobbler .
but what trade art thou ?
answer me directly .
a trade , sir , that , i hope , i may use with a safe conscience , which is , indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles .
what trade , thou knave ?
thou naughty knave , what trade ?
nay , i beseech you , sir , be not out with me yet , if you be out , sir , i can mend you .
what meanest thou by that ?
mend me , thou saucy fellow !
why , sir , cobble you .
thou art a cobbler , art thou ?
truly , sir , all that i live by is with the awl i meddle with no tradesman matters , nor women matters , but with awl .
i am , indeed , sir , a surgeon to old shoes , when they are in great danger , i recover them .
as proper men as ever trod upon neat leather have gone upon my handiwork .
but wherefore art not in thy shop today ?
why dost thou lead these men about the streets ?
truly , sir , to wear out their shoes , to get myself into more work .
but , indeed , sir , we make holiday , to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph .
wherefore rejoice ?
what conquest brings he home ?
what tributaries follow him to rome , to grace in captive bonds his ?
you blocks , you stones , you worse than senseless things !
o you hard hearts , you cruel men of rome , knew you not pompey ?
many a time and oft have you climb up to walls and battlements , to towers and windows , yea , to , your infants in your arms , and there have sat the livelong day , with patient expectation , to see great pompey pass the streets of rome and when you saw his chariot but appear , have you not made an universal shout , that tiber trembled underneath her banks , to hear the replication of your sounds made in her concave shores ?
and do you now put on your best attire ?
and do you now cull out a holiday ?
and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompey blood ?
be gone !
run to your houses , fall upon your knees , pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude .
go , go , good countrymen , and , for this fault , assemble all the poor men of your sort , draw them to tiber banks , and weep your tears into the channel , till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all .
exeunt all the commoners see whether their basest metal be not moved , they vanish in their guiltiness .
go you down that way towards the capitol , this way will i disrobe the images , if you do find them deck with ceremonies .
may we do so ?
you know it is the feast of lupercal .
it is no matter , let no images be hung with caesar trophies .
i about , and drive away the vulgar from the streets so do you too , where you perceive them thick .

brutus , i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you .
cassius , be not deceived if i have veil my look , i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself .
vexed i am of late with passions of some difference , conceptions only proper to myself , which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors , but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number , cassius , be you one nor construe any further my neglect , than that poor brutus , with himself at war , forgets the shows of love to other men .
then , brutus , i have much mistook your passion , by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value , worthy cogitations .
tell me , good brutus , can you see your face ?
no , cassius , for the eye sees not itself , but by reflection , by some other things .
is just and it is very much lamented , brutus , that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye , that you might see your shadow .
i have heard , where many of the best respect in rome , except immortal caesar , speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age yoke , have wish that noble brutus had his eyes .
into what dangers would you lead me , cassius , that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me ?
therefore , good brutus , be prepared to hear and since you know you can not see yourself so well as by reflection , i , your glass , will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of .
and be not jealous on me , gentle brutus were i a common laugher , or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester , if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them , or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout , then hold me dangerous .
flourish , and shout what means this shouting ?
i do fear , the people choose caesar for their king .
ay , do you fear it ?
then must i think you would not have it so .
i would not , cassius , yet i love him well .
but wherefore do you hold me here so long ?
what is it that you would impart to me ?
if it be aught toward the general good , set honour in one eye and death i ' the other , and i will look on both indifferently , for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death .
i know that virtue to be in you , brutus , as well as i do know your outward favour .
well , honour is the subject of my story .
i can not tell what you and other men think of this life , but , for my single self , i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself .
i was born free as caesar , so were you we both have fed as well , and we can both endure the winter cold as well as he for once , upon a raw and gusty day , the troubled tiber chafing with her shores , caesar said to me thou , cassius , now leap in with me into this angry flood , and swim to yonder point ? '
upon the word , accoutred as i was , i plunged in and bade him follow , so indeed he did .
the torrent roar , and we did buffet it with lusty sinews , throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy , but ere we could arrive the point proposed , caesar cried me , cassius , or i sink ! '
i , as aeneas , our great ancestor , did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear , so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar .
and this man is now become a god , and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body , if caesar carelessly but nod on him .
he had a fever when he was in spain , and when the fit was on him , i did mark how he did shake is true , this god did shake , his coward lips did from their colour fly , and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre i did hear him groan ay , and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books , alas , it cried me some drink , titinius , ' as a sick girl .
ye gods , it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone .
shout .
flourish another general shout !
i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heap on caesar .
why , man , he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves .
men at some time are masters of their fates the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves , that we are underlings .
brutus and caesar what should be in that ' ?
why should that name be sounded more than yours ?
write them together , yours is as fair a name , sound them , it doth become the mouth as well , weigh them , it is as heavy , conjure with , brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar .
now , in the names of all the gods at once , upon what meat doth this our caesar feed , that he is grown so great ?
age , thou art shamed !
rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !
when went there by an age , since the great flood , but it was famed with more than with one man ?
when could they say till now , that talk of rome , that her wide walls encompass but one man ?
now is it rome indeed and room enough , when there is in it but one only man .
o , you and i have heard our fathers say , there was a brutus once that would have brook the eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king .
that you do love me , i am nothing jealous , what you would work me to , i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times , i shall recount hereafter , for this present , i would not , so with love i might entreat you , be any further moved .
what you have said i will consider , what you have to say i will with patience hear , and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things .
till then , my noble friend , chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us .
i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus .
the games are done and caesar is returning .
as they pass by , pluck casca by the sleeve , and he will , after his sour fashion , tell you what hath proceeded worthy note .
caesar and his train i will do so .
but , look you , cassius , the angry spot doth glow on caesar brow , and all the rest look like a chidden train calpurnia cheek is pale , and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol , being cross in conference by some senators .
casca will tell us what the matter is .
antonius !
caesar ?
let me have men about me that are fat , men and such as sleep o ' nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look , he thinks too much such men are dangerous .
fear him not , caesar , he not dangerous , he is a noble roman and well given .
would he were fatter !
but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear , i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius .
he reads much , he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays , as thou dost , antony , he hears no music , seldom he smiles , and smiles in such a sort as if he mock himself and scorn his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing .
such men as he be never at heart ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves , and therefore are they very dangerous .
i rather tell thee what is to be fear than what i fear , for always i am caesar .
come on my right hand , for this ear is deaf , and tell me truly what thou of him .
sennet .
exeunt caesar and all his train , but casca you pull me by the cloak , would you speak with me ?
ay , casca , tell us what hath chanced , that caesar looks so sad .
why , you were with him , were you not ?
i should not then ask casca what had chanced .
why , there was a crown offered him and being offered him , he put it by with the back of his hand , thus , and then the people fell .
what was the second noise for ?
why , for that too .
they shouted thrice what was the last cry for ?
why , for that too .
was the crown offered him thrice ?
ay , marry , , and he put it by thrice , every time gentler than other , and at every mine honest neighbours shouted .
who offered him the crown ?
why , antony .
tell us the manner of it , gentle casca .
i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery , i did not mark it .
i saw mark antony offer him a crown , yet was not a crown neither , was one of these coronets , and , as i told you , he put it by once but , for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it .
then he offered it to him again , then he put it by again but , to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it .
and then he offered it the third time , he put it the third time by and still as he refused it , the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar , for he swounded and fell down at it and for mine own part , i durst not laugh , for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air .
but , soft , i pray you what , did caesar swound ?
he fell down in the , and foamed at mouth , and was speechless .
is very like he hath the failing sickness .
no , caesar hath it not , but you and i , and honest casca , we have the falling sickness .
i know not what you mean by that , but , i am sure , caesar fell down .
if the people did not clap him and hiss him , according as he pleased and displeased them , as they use to do the players in the theatre , i am no true man .
what said he when he came unto himself ?
marry , before he fell down , when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown , he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut .
an i had been a man of any occupation , if i would not have taken him at a word , i would i might go to hell among the rogues .
and so he fell .
when he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said any thing amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity .
three or four wenches , where i stood , cried , good soul ! '
and forgave him with all their hearts but there no heed to be taken of them , if caesar had stabbed their mothers , they would have done no less .
and after that , he came , thus sad , away ?
ay .
did cicero say any thing ?
ay , he spoke greek .
to what effect ?
nay , an i tell you that , ill look you i ' the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads , but , for mine own part , it was greek to me .
i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius , for pulling scarfs off caesar images , are put to silence .
fare you well .
there was more foolery yet , if i could remember it .
will you sup with me , casca ?
no , i am promised forth .
will you dine with me ?
ay , if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating .
good i will expect you .
do so .
farewell , both .
exit what a blunt fellow is this grown to be !
he was quick mettle when he went to school .
so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise , however he puts on this tardy form .
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit , which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite .
and so it is .
for this time i will leave you , if you please to speak with me , i will come home to you , or , if you will , come home to me , and i will wait for you .
i will do so till then , think of the world .
exit brutus well , brutus , thou art noble , yet , i see , thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes , for who so firm that can not be seduced ?
caesar doth bear me hard , but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius , he should not humour me .
i will this night , in several hands , in at his windows throw , as if they came from several citizens , writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name , wherein obscurely caesar ambition shall be glanced at and after this let caesar seat him sure , for we will shake him , or worse days endure .
exit scene iii .
the same .
a street .
thunder and lightning .
enter from opposite sides , casca , with his sword drawn , and cicero good even , casca brought you caesar home ?
why are you breathless ?
and why stare you so ?
are not you moved , when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm ?
o cicero , i have seen tempests , when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks , and i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam , to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till , never till now , did i go through a tempest dropping fire .
either there is a civil strife in heaven , or else the world , too saucy with the gods , incenses them to send destruction .
why , saw you any thing more wonderful ?
a common slave you know him well by sight held up his left hand , which did flame and burn like twenty torches join , and yet his hand , not sensible of fire , remain unscorch .
besides i ha ' not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion , who glared upon me , and went surly by , without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women , transformed with their fear , who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets .
and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at upon the , hooting and shrieking .
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet , let not men say are their reasons , they are natural , ' for , i believe , they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon .
indeed , it is a time but men may construe things after their fashion , clean from the purpose of the things themselves .
come caesar to the capitol ?
he doth , for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there .
good night then , casca this disturbed sky is not to walk in .
farewell , cicero .
exit cicero enter cassius who there ?
a roman .
casca , by your voice .
your ear is good .
cassius , what night is this !
a very pleasing night to honest men .
who ever knew the heavens menace so ?
those that have known the earth so full of faults .
for my part , i have walk about the streets , submitting me unto the perilous night , and , thus unbraced , casca , as you see , have bared my bosom to the , and when the cross blue lightning seem to open the breast of heaven , i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it .
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ?
it is the part of men to fear and tremble , when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us .
you are dull , casca , and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want , or else you use not .
you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder , to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires , why all these gliding ghosts , why birds and beasts from quality and kind , why old men fool and children calculate , why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous quality , why , you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits , to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state .
now could i , casca , name to thee a man most like this dreadful night , that thunders , lightens , opens graves , and roars as doth the lion in the capitol , a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action , yet prodigious grown and fearful , as these strange eruptions are .
is caesar that you mean , is it not , cassius ?
let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors , but , woe the while !
our fathers ' minds are dead , and we are govern with our mothers ' spirits , our yoke and sufferance show us womanish .
indeed , they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king , and he shall wear his crown by sea and land , in every place , save here in italy .
i know where i will wear this dagger then , cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein , ye gods , you make the weak most strong , therein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron , can be retentive to the strength of spirit , but life , being weary of these worldly bars , never lacks power to dismiss itself .
if i know this , know all the world besides , that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure .
thunder still so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity .
and why should caesar be a tyrant then ?
poor man !
i know he would not be a wolf , but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion , were not romans hinds .
those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome , what rubbish and what offal , when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar !
but , o grief , where hast thou led me ?
i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman , then i know my answer must be made .
but i am arm , and dangers are to me indifferent .
you speak to casca , and to such a man that is no fleering .
hold , my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs , and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest .
there a bargain made .
now know you , casca , i have moved already some certain of the romans to undergo with me an enterprise of consequence , and i do know , by this , they stay for me in pompey porch for now , this fearful night , there is no stir or walking in the streets , and the complexion of the element in favour like the work we have in hand , most bloody , fiery , and most terrible .
stand close awhile , for here comes one in haste .
is cinna , i do know him by his gait , he is a friend .
enter cinna cinna , where haste you so ?
to find out you .
who that ?
metellus cimber ?
no , it is casca , one incorporate to our attempts .
am i not stay for , cinna ?
i am glad on .
what a fearful night is this !
there two or three of us have seen strange sights .
am i not stay for ?
tell me .
yes , you are .
o cassius , if you could but win the noble brutus to our party be you content good cinna , take this paper , and look you lay it in the praetor chair , where brutus may but find it , and throw this in at his window , set this up with wax upon old brutus ' statue all this done , repair to pompey porch , where you shall find us .
is decius brutus and trebonius there ?
all but metellus cimber , and he gone to seek you at your house .
well , i will hie , and so bestow these papers as you bade me .
that done , repair to pompey theatre .
exit cinna come , casca , you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already , and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours .
o , he sits high in all the people hearts and that which would appear offence in us , his countenance , like richest alchemy , will change to virtue and to worthiness .
him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited .
let us go , for it is after midnight , and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him .
exeunt act ii scene rome .
brutus orchard .
enter brutus what , lucius , ho !
i can not , by the progress of the stars , give guess how near to day .
lucius , i say !
i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly .
when , lucius , when ?
awake , i say !
what , lucius !
enter lucius call you , my lord ?
get me a taper in my study , lucius when it is lighted , come and call me here .
i will , my lord .
exit it must be by his death and for my part , i know no personal cause to spurn at him , but for the general .
he would be crown how that might change his nature , there the question .
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder , and that craves wary walking .
crown him ? that , and then , i grant , we put a sting in him , that at his will he may do danger with .
the abuse of greatness is , when it disjoins remorse from power and , to speak truth of caesar , i have not known when his affections sway more than his reason .
but is a common proof , that lowliness is young ambition ladder , whereto the turns his face , but when he once attains the upmost round .
he then unto the ladder turns his back , looks in the clouds , scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend .
so caesar may .
then , lest he may , prevent .
and , since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is , fashion it thus , that what he is , augmented , would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent egg which , hatch , would , as his kind , grow mischievous , and kill him in the shell .
lucius the taper burneth in your closet , sir .
searching the window for a flint , i found this paper , thus seal up , and , i am sure , it did not lie there when i went to bed .
gives him the letter get you to bed again , it is not day .
is not , boy , the ides of march ?
i know not , sir .
look in the calendar , and bring me word .
i will , sir .
exit the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them .
opens the letter and reads , thou awake , and see thyself .
shall rome , and speak , strike , redress !
brutus , thou awake ! '
such instigations have been often dropp where i have took them up .
rome , and ' thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man awe ?
what , rome ?
my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive , when he was call a king .
, strike , redress ! '
am i entreated to speak and strike ?
o rome , i make thee promise if the redress will follow , thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus !
lucius sir , march is wasted fourteen days .
knocking within is good .
go to the gate , somebody knocks .
exit lucius since cassius first did whet me against caesar , i have not slept .
between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion , all the interim is like a phantasma , or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council , and the state of man , like to a little kingdom , suffers then the nature of an insurrection .
lucius sir , is your brother cassius at the door , who doth desire to see you .
is he alone ?
no , sir , there are moe with him .
do you know them ?
no , sir , their hats are pluck about their ears , and half their faces buried in their cloaks , that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favour .
let enter .
exit lucius they are the faction .
o conspiracy , shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night , when evils are most free ?
o , then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage ?
seek none , conspiracy , hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path , thy native semblance on , not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention .
enter the conspirators , cassius , casca , decius brutus , cinna , metellus cimber , and trebonius i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow , brutus , do we trouble you ?
i have been up this hour , awake all night .
know i these men that come along with you ?
yes , every man of them , and no man here but honours you , and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you .
this is trebonius .
he is welcome hither .
this , decius brutus .
he is welcome too .
this , casca , this , cinna , and this , metellus cimber .
they are all welcome .
what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night ?
shall i entreat a word ?
brutus and cassius whisper here lies the east doth not the day break here ?
no .
o , pardon , sir , it doth , and yon gray lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day .
you shall confess that you are both deceived .
here , as i point my sword , the sun arises , which is a great way growing on the south , weighing the youthful season of the year .
some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire , and the high east stands , as the capitol , directly here .
give me your hands all over , one by one .
and let us swear our resolution .
no , not an oath if not the face of men , the sufferance of our souls , the time abuse , if these be motives weak , break off betimes , and every man hence to his idle bed , so let tyranny range on , till each man drop by lottery .
but if these , as i am sure they do , bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , what need we any spur but our own cause , to prick us to redress ?
what other bond than secret romans , that have spoke the word , and will not palter ?
and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged , that this shall be , or we will fall for it ?
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs , unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt , but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise , nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits , to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath , when every drop of blood that every roman bears , and nobly bears , is guilty of a several bastardy , if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath pass from him .
but what of cicero ?
shall we sound him ?
i think he will stand very strong with us .
let us not leave him out .
no , by no means .
o , let us have him , for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men voices to commend our deeds it shall be said , his judgment ruled our hands , our youths and wildness shall no whit appear , but all be buried in his gravity .
o , name him not let us not break with him , for he will never follow any thing that other men begin .
then leave him out .
indeed he is not fit .
shall no man else be touch but only caesar ?
decius , well urged i think it is not meet , mark antony , so well beloved of caesar , should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver , and , you know , his means , if he improve them , may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent , let antony and caesar fall together .
our course will seem too bloody , caius cassius , to cut the head off and then hack the limbs , like wrath in death and envy afterwards , for antony is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrificers , but not butchers , caius .
we all stand up against the spirit of caesar , and in the spirit of men there is no blood o , that we then could come by caesar spirit , and not dismember caesar !
but , alas , caesar must bleed for it !
and , gentle friends , let kill him boldly , but not wrathfully , let carve him as a dish fit for the gods , not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts , as subtle masters do , stir up their servants to an act of rage , and after seem to chide .
this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes , we shall be call purgers , not murderers .
and for mark antony , think not of him , for he can do no more than caesar arm when caesar head is off .
yet i fear him , for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar alas , good cassius , do not think of him if he love caesar , all that he can do is to himself , take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should , for he is given to sports , to wildness and much company .
there is no fear in him , let him not die , for he will live , and laugh at this hereafter .
clock strikes peace !
count the clock .
the clock hath stricken three .
is time to part .
but it is doubtful yet , whether caesar will come forth , or no , for he is superstitious grown of late , quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy , of dreams and ceremonies it may be , these apparent prodigies , the unaccustom terror of this night , and the persuasion of his augurers , may hold him from the capitol .
never fear that if he be so resolved , i can him , for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betray with trees , and bears with glasses , elephants with holes , lions with toils and men with flatterers , but when i tell him he hates flatterers , he says he does , being then most flattered .
let me work , for i can give his humour the true bent , and i will bring him to the capitol .
nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .
by the eighth hour is that the uttermost ?
be that the uttermost , and fail not then .
caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard , who rated him for speaking well of pompey i wonder none of you have thought of him .
now , good metellus , go along by him he loves me well , and i have given him reasons , send him but hither , and i fashion him .
the morning comes upon we leave you , brutus .
and , friends , disperse yourselves , but all remember what you have said , and show yourselves true romans .
good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily , let not our looks put on our purposes , but bear it as our roman actors do , with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one .
exeunt all but brutus boy !
lucius !
fast asleep ?
it is no matter , enjoy the dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies , which busy care draws in the brains of men , therefore thou so sound .
enter portia brutus , my lord !
portia , what mean you ?
wherefore rise you now ?
it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning .
nor for yours neither .
you ungently , brutus , stole from my bed and yesternight , at supper , you suddenly arose , and walk about , musing and sighing , with your arms across , and when i ask you what the matter was , you stared upon me with ungentle looks , i urged you further , then you scratch your head , and too impatiently stamp with your foot , yet i insisted , yet you answer not , but , with an angry wafture of your hand , gave sign for me to leave you so i did , fearing to strengthen that impatience which seem too much enkindled , and withal hoping it was but an effect of humour , which sometime hath his hour with every man .
it will not let you eat , nor talk , nor sleep , and could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevail on your condition , i should not know you , brutus .
dear my lord , make me acquainted with your cause of grief .
i am not well in health , and that is all .
brutus is wise , and , were he not in health , he would embrace the means to come by it .
why , so i do .
good portia , go to bed .
is brutus sick ?
and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humours of the dank morning ?
what , is brutus sick , and will he steal out of his wholesome bed , to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness ?
no , my brutus , you have some sick offence within your mind , which , by the right and virtue of my place , i ought to know of and , upon my knees , i charm you , by my beauty , by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one , that you unfold to me , yourself , your half , why you are heavy , and what men have had to resort to you for here have been some six or seven , who did hide their faces even from darkness .
kneel not , gentle portia .
i should not need , if you were gentle brutus .
within the bond of marriage , tell me , brutus , is it excepted i should know no secrets that appertain to you ?
am i yourself but , as it were , in sort or limitation , to keep with you at meals , comfort your bed , and talk to you sometimes ?
dwell i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure ?
if it be no more , portia is brutus ' harlot , not his wife .
you are my true and honourable wife , as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart if this were true , then should i know this secret .
i grant i am a woman , but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife i grant i am a woman , but withal a woman , cato daughter .
think you i am no stronger than my sex , being so father and so husbanded ?
tell me your counsels , i will not disclose i have made strong proof of my constancy , giving myself a voluntary wound here , in the thigh can i bear that with patience .
and not my husband secrets ?
o ye gods , render me worthy of this noble wife !
knocking within hark , hark !
one knocks portia , go in awhile , and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart .
all my engagements i will construe to thee , all the charactery of my sad brows leave me with haste .
exit portia lucius , who that knocks ?
lucius with ligarius he is a sick man that would speak with you .
caius ligarius , that metellus spake of .
boy , stand aside .
caius ligarius !
how ?
vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue .
o , what a time have you chose out , brave caius , to wear a kerchief !
would you were not sick !
i am not sick , if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honour .
such an exploit have i in hand , ligarius , had you a healthful ear to hear of it .
by all the gods that romans bow before , i here discard my sickness !
soul of rome !
brave son , derived from honourable loins !
thou , like an exorcist , hast conjured up my mortified spirit .
now bid me run , and i will strive with things impossible , yea , get the better of them .
what to do ?
a piece of work that will make sick men whole .
but are not some whole that we must make sick ?
that must we also .
what it is , my caius , i shall unfold to thee , as we are going to whom it must be done .
set on your foot , and with a heart i follow you , to do i know not what but it sufficeth that brutus leads me on .
follow me , then .
exeunt scene ii .
caesar house .
thunder and lightning .
enter caesar , in his nor heaven nor earth have been at peace thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out , , ho !
they murder caesar ! '
who within ?
enter a servant my lord ?
go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success .
i will , my lord .
exit enter calpurnia what mean you , caesar ?
think you to walk forth ?
you shall not stir out of your house .
caesar shall forth the things that threaten me look but on my back , when they shall see the face of caesar , they are vanished .
caesar , i never stood on ceremonies , yet now they fright me .
there is one within , besides the things that we have heard and seen , recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch .
a lioness hath whelped in the streets , and graves have yawn , and yielded up their dead , fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds , in ranks and squadrons and right form of war , which drizzled blood upon the capitol , the noise of battle hurtled in the air , horses did neigh , and dying men did groan , and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets .
o caesar !
these things are beyond all use , and i do fear them .
what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods ?
yet caesar shall go forth , for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar .
when beggars die , there are no comets seen , the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .
cowards die many times before their deaths , the valiant never taste of death but once .
of all the wonders that i yet have heard .
it seems to me most strange that men should fear , seeing that death , a necessary end , will come when it will come .
servant what say the augurers ?
they would not have you to stir forth .
plucking the entrails of an offering forth , they could not find a heart within the beast .
the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart , if he should stay at home for fear .
no , caesar shall not danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he we are two lions litter in one day , and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth .
alas , my lord , your wisdom is consumed in confidence .
do not go forth call it my fear that keeps you in the house , and not your own .
we send mark antony to the and he shall say you are not well let me , upon my knee , prevail in this .
mark antony shall say i am not well , and , for thy humour , i will stay at home .
enter decius brutus here decius brutus , he shall tell them so .
caesar , all hail !
good morrow , worthy caesar i come to fetch you to the .
and you are come in very happy time , to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come can not , is false , and that i dare not , falser i will not come tell them so , decius .
say he is sick .
shall caesar send a lie ?
have i in conquest stretch mine arm so far , to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth ?
decius , go tell them caesar will not come .
most mighty caesar , let me know some cause , lest i be laugh at when i tell them so .
the cause is in my will i will not come , that is enough to satisfy the senate .
but for your private satisfaction , because i love you , i will let you know calpurnia here , my wife , stays me at home she dreamt she saw my statua , which , like a fountain with an hundred spouts , did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling , and did bathe their hands in it and these does she apply for warnings , and portents , and evils imminent , and on her knee hath begg that i will stay at home .
this dream is all amiss interpreted , it was a vision fair and fortunate your statue spouting blood in many pipes , in which so many smiling romans bathed , signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood , and that great men shall press for tinctures , stains , relics and cognizance .
this by calpurnia dream is signified .
and this way have you well expounded it .
i have , when you have heard what i can say and know it now the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar .
if you shall send them word you will not come , their minds may change .
besides , it were a mock apt to be render , for some one to say up the senate till another time , when caesar wife shall meet with better dreams . '
if caesar hide himself , shall they not whisper , caesar is afraid ' ?
pardon me , caesar , for my dear dear love to our proceeding bids me tell you this , and reason to my love is liable .
how foolish do your fears seem now , calpurnia !
i am ashamed i did yield to them .
give me my robe , for i will go .
enter publius , brutus , ligarius , metellus , casca , trebonius , and cinna and look where publius is come to fetch me .
good morrow , caesar .
welcome , publius .
what , brutus , are you stirr so early too ?
good morrow , casca .
caius ligarius , caesar was so much your enemy as that same ague which hath made you lean .
what is ?
caesar , is strucken eight .
i thank you for your pains and courtesy .
enter antony see !
antony , that revels long o ' nights , is notwithstanding up .
good morrow , antony .
so to most noble caesar .
bid them prepare within i am to blame to be thus waited for .
now , cinna now , metellus what , trebonius !
i have an hour talk in store for you , remember that you call on me be near me , that i may remember you .
caesar , i will aside and so near will i be , that your best friends shall wish i had been further .
good friends , go in , and taste some wine with me , and we , like friends , will straightway go together .
aside that every like is not the same , o caesar , the heart of brutus yearns to think upon !
exeunt scene iii .
a street near the capitol .
enter artemidorus , reading a paper , beware of brutus , take heed of cassius , come not near casca , have an eye to cinna , trust not trebonius mark well metellus cimber decius brutus loves thee not thou hast wronged caius ligarius .
there is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against caesar .
if thou beest not immortal , look about you security gives way to conspiracy .
the mighty gods defend thee !
thy lover , . '
here will i stand till caesar pass along , and as a suitor will i give him this .
my heart laments that virtue can not live out of the teeth of emulation .
if thou read this , o caesar , thou mayst live , if not , the fates with traitors do contrive .
exit scene iv .
another part of the same street , before the house of brutus .
enter portia and lucius i prithee , boy , run to the , stay not to answer me , but get thee gone why dost thou stay ?
to know my errand , madam .
i would have had thee there , and here again , ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there .
o constancy , be strong upon my side , set a huge mountain my heart and tongue !
i have a man mind , but a woman might .
how hard it is for women to keep counsel !
art thou here yet ?
madam , what should i do ?
run to the capitol , and nothing else ?
and so return to you , and nothing else ?
yes , bring me word , boy , if thy lord look well , for he went sickly forth and take good note what caesar doth , what suitors press to him .
hark , boy !
what noise is that ?
i hear none , madam .
prithee , listen well , i heard a bustling rumour , like a fray , and the wind brings it from the capitol .
sooth , madam , i hear nothing .
enter the soothsayer come hither , fellow which way hast thou been ?
at mine own house , good lady .
what ?
about the ninth hour , lady .
is caesar yet gone to the capitol ?
madam , not yet i go to take my stand , to see him pass on to the capitol .
thou hast some suit to caesar , hast thou not ?
that i have , lady if it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear me , i shall beseech him to befriend himself .
why , thou any harm intended towards him ?
none that i know will be , much that i fear may chance .
good morrow to you .
here the street is narrow the throng that follows caesar at the heels , of senators , of praetors , common suitors , will crowd a feeble man almost to death i get me to a place more void , and there speak to great caesar as he comes along .
exit i must go in .
ay me , how weak a thing the heart of woman is !
o brutus , the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise !
sure , the boy heard me brutus hath a suit that caesar will not grant .
o , i grow faint .
run , lucius , and commend me to my lord , say i am merry come to me again , and bring me word what he doth say to thee .
exeunt severally act iii scene rome .
before the capitol , the senate sitting above .
a crowd of people , among them artemidorus and the soothsayer .
flourish .
enter caesar , brutus , cassius , casca , decius brutus , metellus cimber , trebonius , cinna , antony , lepidus , popilius , publius , and others to the soothsayer the ides of march are come .
ay , caesar , but not gone .
hail , caesar !
read this schedule .
trebonius doth desire you to , at your best leisure , this his humble suit .
o caesar , read mine first , for mine a suit that touches caesar nearer read it , great caesar .
what touches us ourself shall be last served .
delay not , caesar , read it instantly .
what , is the fellow mad ?
sirrah , give place .
what , urge you your petitions in the street ?
come to the capitol .
caesar goes up to the , the rest following i wish your enterprise may thrive .
what enterprise , popilius ?
fare you well .
advances to caesar what said popilius lena ?
he wish our enterprise might thrive .
i fear our purpose is discovered .
look , how he makes to caesar , mark him .
casca , be sudden , for we fear prevention .
brutus , what shall be done ?
if this be known , cassius or caesar never shall turn back , for i will slay myself .
cassius , be constant popilius lena speaks not of our purposes , for , look , he smiles , and caesar doth not change .
trebonius knows his time , for , look you , brutus .
he draws mark antony out of the way .
exeunt antony and trebonius where is metellus cimber ?
let him go , and presently prefer his suit to caesar .
he is address press near and second him .
casca , you are the first that rears your hand .
are we all ready ?
what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress ?
most high , most mighty , and most puissant caesar , metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart , kneeling i must prevent thee , cimber .
these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men , and turn and first decree into the law of children .
be not fond , to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thaw from the true quality with that which melteth fools , i mean , sweet words , and base .
thy brother by decree is banished if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him , i spurn thee like a cur out of my way .
know , caesar doth not wrong , nor without cause will he be satisfied .
is there no voice more worthy than my own to sound more sweetly in great caesar ear for the repealing of my banish brother ?
i kiss thy hand , but not in flattery , caesar , desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal .
what , brutus !
pardon , caesar , caesar , pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall , to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber .
i could be well moved , if i were as you if i could pray to move , prayers would move me but i am constant as the northern star , of whose and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament .
the skies are painted with unnumber sparks , they are all fire and every one doth shine , but there but one in all doth hold his place so in the world , is furnish well with men , and men are flesh and blood , and apprehensive , yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank , unshaked of motion and that i am he , let me a little show it , even in this , that i was constant cimber should be banish , and constant do remain to keep him so .
o caesar , hence !
wilt thou lift up olympus ?
great caesar , doth not brutus bootless kneel ?
speak , hands for me !
casca first , then the other conspirators and brutus stab caesar et tu , brute !
then fall , caesar .
dies liberty !
freedom !
tyranny is dead !
run hence , proclaim , cry it about the streets .
some to the common pulpits , and cry out , freedom , and enfranchisement ! '
people and senators , be not affrighted , fly not , stand stiff ambition debt is paid .
go to the pulpit , brutus .
and cassius too .
where publius ?
here , quite confounded with this mutiny .
stand fast together , lest some friend of caesar should chance talk not of standing .
publius , good cheer , there is no harm intended to your person , nor to no roman else so tell them , publius .
and leave us , publius , lest that the people , rushing on us , should do your age some mischief .
do so and let no man abide this deed , but we the doers .
trebonius where is antony ?
fled to his house amazed men , wives and children stare , cry out and run as it were doomsday .
fates , we will know your pleasures that we shall die , we know , is but the time and drawing days out , that men stand upon .
why , he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death .
grant that , and then is death a benefit so are we caesar friends , that have abridged his time of fearing death .
stoop , romans , stoop , and let us bathe our hands in caesar blood up to the elbows , and besmear our swords then walk we forth , even to the , and , waving our red weapons our heads , let all cry , freedom and liberty ! '
stoop , then , and how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown !
how many times shall caesar bleed in sport , that now on pompey basis lies along no worthier than the dust !
so oft as that shall be , so often shall the knot of us be call the men that gave their country liberty .
what , shall we forth ?
ay , every man away brutus shall lead , and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome .
enter a servant soft !
who comes here ?
a friend of antony .
thus , brutus , did my master bid me kneel thus did mark antony bid me fall down , and , being prostrate , thus he bade me say brutus is noble , wise , valiant , and honest , caesar was mighty , bold , royal , and loving say i love brutus , and i honour him , say i fear caesar , honour him and loved him .
if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him , and be resolved how caesar hath deserved to lie in death , mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living , but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith .
so says my master antony .
thy master is a wise and valiant roman , i never thought him worse .
tell him , so please him come unto this place , he shall be satisfied , and , by my honour , depart untouch .
i fetch him presently .
exit i know that we shall have him well to friend .
i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much , and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose .
but here comes antony .
antony welcome , mark antony .
o mighty caesar !
dost thou lie so low ?
are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , shrunk to this little measure ?
fare thee well .
i know not , gentlemen , what you intend , who else must be let blood , who else is rank if i myself , there is no hour so fit as caesar death hour , nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords , made rich with the most noble blood of all this world .
i do beseech ye , if you bear me hard , now , whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke , fulfil your pleasure .
live a thousand years , i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so , no mean of death , as here by caesar , and by you cut off , the choice and master spirits of this age .
o antony , beg not your death of us .
though now we must appear bloody and cruel , as , by our hands and this our present act , you see we do , yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not , they are pitiful , and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire , so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar .
for your part , to you our swords have leaden points , mark antony our arms , in strength of malice , and our hearts of brothers ' temper , do receive you in with all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
your voice shall be as strong as any man in the disposing of new dignities .
only be patient till we have appeased the multitude , beside themselves with fear , and then we will deliver you the cause , why i , that did love caesar when i struck him , have thus proceeded .
i doubt not of your wisdom .
let each man render me his bloody hand first , marcus brutus , will i shake with you , next , caius cassius , do i take your hand , now , decius brutus , yours now yours , metellus , yours , cinna , and , my valiant casca , yours , though last , not last in love , yours , good trebonius .
gentlemen all , alas , what shall i say ?
my credit now stands on such slippery ground , that one of two bad ways you must conceit me , either a coward or a flatterer .
that i did love thee , caesar , o , is true if then thy spirit look upon us now , shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death , to see thy thy anthony making his peace , shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes , most noble !
in the presence of thy corse ?
had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds , weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood , it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies .
pardon me , julius !
here wast thou bay , brave hart , here didst thou fall , and here thy hunters stand , sign in thy spoil , and crimson in thy lethe .
o world , thou wast the forest to this hart , and this , indeed , o world , the heart of thee .
how like a deer , strucken by many princes , dost thou here lie !
mark antony , pardon me , caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this , then , in a friend , it is cold modesty .
i blame you not for praising caesar so , but what compact mean you to have with us ?
will you be prick in number of our friends , or shall we on , and not depend on you ?
therefore i took your hands , but was , indeed , sway from the point , by looking down on caesar .
friends am i with you all and love you all , upon this hope , that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous .
or else were this a savage spectacle our reasons are so full of good regard that were you , antony , the son of caesar , you should be satisfied .
that all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the , and in the pulpit , as becomes a friend , speak in the order of his funeral .
you shall , mark antony .
brutus , a word with you .
aside to brutus you know not what you do do not consent that antony speak in his funeral know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter ?
by your pardon , i will myself into the pulpit first , and show the reason of our caesar death what antony shall speak , i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission , and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies .
it shall advantage more than do us wrong .
i know not what may fall , i like it not .
mark antony , here , take you caesar body .
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us , but speak all good you can devise of caesar , and say you by our permission , else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going , after my speech is ended .
be it so .
i do desire no more .
prepare the body then , and follow us .
exeunt all but antony o , pardon me , thou bleeding piece of earth , that i am meek and gentle with these butchers !
thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times .
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood !
over thy wounds now do i prophesy , which , like dumb mouths , do ope their ruby lips , to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men , domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy , blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarter with the hands of war , all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesar spirit , ranging for revenge , with ate by his side come hot from hell , shall in these confines with a monarch voice cry , ' and let slip the dogs of war , that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men , groaning for burial .
enter a servant you serve octavius caesar , do you not ?
i do , mark antony .
caesar did write for him to come to rome .
he did receive his letters , and is coming , and bid me say to you by word of mouth o caesar ! seeing the body thy heart is big , get thee apart and weep .
passion , i see , is catching , for mine eyes , seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine , began to water .
is thy master coming ?
he lies within seven leagues of rome .
post back with speed , and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome , a dangerous rome , no rome of safety for octavius yet , hie hence , and tell him so .
yet , stay awhile , thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the there shall i try in my oration , how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men , according to the which , thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things .
lend me your hand .
exeunt with caesar body scene ii .
the forum .
enter brutus and cassius , and a throng of citizens we will be satisfied , let us be satisfied .
then follow me , and give me audience , friends .
cassius , go you into the other street , and part the numbers .
those that will hear me speak , let stay here , those that will follow cassius , go with him , and public reasons shall be rendered of caesar death .
i will hear brutus speak .
i will hear cassius , and compare their reasons , when severally we hear them rendered .
exit cassius , with some of the citizens .
brutus goes into the pulpit the noble brutus is ascended silence !
be patient till the last .
romans , countrymen , and lovers !
hear me for my cause , and be silent , that you may hear believe me for mine honour , and have respect to mine honour , that you may believe censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses , that you may the better judge .
if there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of caesar , to him i say , that brutus ' love to caesar was no less than his .
if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar , this is my answer not that i loved caesar less , but that i loved rome more .
had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves , than that caesar were dead , to live all free men ?
as caesar loved me , i weep for him , as he was fortunate , i rejoice at it , as he was valiant , i honour him but , as he was ambitious , i slew him .
there is tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honour for his valour , and death for his ambition .
who is here so base that would be a bondman ?
if any , speak , for him have i offended .
who is here so rude that would not be a roman ?
if any , speak , for him have i offended .
who is here so vile that will not love his country ?
if any , speak , for him have i offended .
i pause for a reply .
none , brutus , none .
then none have i offended .
i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus .
the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol , his glory not extenuated , wherein he was worthy , nor his offences enforced , for which he suffered death .
enter antony and others , with caesar body here comes his body , mourned by mark antony who , though he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying , a place in the commonwealth , as which of you shall not ?
with this i depart , that , as i slew my best lover for the good of rome , i have the same dagger for myself , when it shall please my country to need my death .
live , brutus !
live , live !
bring him with triumph home unto his house .
give him a statue with his ancestors .
let him be caesar .
caesar better parts shall be crown in brutus .
we bring him to his house with shouts and clamours .
my countrymen , peace , silence !
brutus speaks .
peace , ho !
good countrymen , let me depart alone , and , for my sake , stay here with antony do grace to caesar corpse , and grace his speech tending to caesar glories , which mark antony , by our permission , is allow to make .
i do entreat you , not a man depart , save i alone , till antony have spoke .
exit stay , ho !
and let us hear mark antony .
let him go up into the public chair , we hear him .
noble antony , go up .
for brutus ' sake , i am beholding to you .
goes into the pulpit what does he say of brutus ?
he says , for brutus ' sake , he finds himself beholding to us all .
best he speak no harm of brutus here .
this caesar was a tyrant .
nay , that certain we are blest that rome is rid of him .
peace !
let us hear what antony can say .
you gentle romans , peace , ho !
let us hear him .
friends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ears , i come to bury caesar , not to praise him .
the evil that men do lives after them , the good is oft interred with their bones , so let it be with caesar .
the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so , it was a grievous fault , and grievously hath caesar answer it .
here , under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man , so are they all , all honourable men come i to speak in caesar funeral .
he was my friend , faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honourable man .
he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious ?
when that the poor have cried , caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honourable man .
you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown , which he did thrice refuse was this ambition ?
yet brutus says he was ambitious , and , sure , he is an honourable man .
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke , but here i am to speak what i do know .
you all did love him once , not without cause what cause withholds you then , to mourn for him ?
o judgment !
thou art fled to brutish beasts , and men have lost their reason .
bear with me , my heart is in the coffin there with caesar , and i must pause till it come back to me .
methinks there is much reason in his sayings .
if thou consider rightly of the matter , caesar has had great wrong .
has he , masters ?
i fear there will a worse come in his place .
mark ye his words ?
he would not take the crown , therefore is certain he was not ambitious .
if it be found so , some will dear abide it .
poor soul !
his eyes are red as fire with weeping .
there not a nobler man in rome than antony .
now mark him , he begins again to speak .
but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world , now lies he there .
and none so poor to do him reverence .
o masters , if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , i should do brutus wrong , and cassius wrong , who , you all know , are honourable men i will not do them wrong , i rather choose to wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , than i will wrong such honourable men .
but here a parchment with the seal of caesar , i found it in his closet , is his will let but the commons hear this testament which , pardon me , i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesar wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood , yea , beg a hair of him for memory , and , dying , mention it within their wills , bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue .
we hear the will read it , mark antony .
the will , the will !
we will hear caesar will .
have patience , gentle friends , i must not read it , it is not meet you know how caesar loved you .
you are not wood , you are not stones , but men , and , being men , bearing the will of caesar , it will inflame you , it will make you mad is good you know not that you are his heirs , for , if you should , o , what would come of it !
read the will , we hear it , antony , you shall read us the will , caesar will .
will you be patient ?
will you stay awhile ?
i have myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honourable men whose daggers have stabb caesar , i do fear it .
they were traitors honourable men !
the will !
the testament !
they were villains , murderers the will !
read the will .
you will compel me , then , to read the will ?
then make a ring about the corpse of caesar , and let me show you him that made the will .
shall i descend ?
and will you give me leave ?
come down .
descend .
you shall have leave .
antony comes down a ring , stand round .
stand from the hearse , stand from the body .
room for antony , most noble antony .
nay , press not so upon me , stand far off .
stand back , room , bear back .
if you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on , was on a summer evening , in his tent , that day he overcame the nervii look , in this place ran cassius ' dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the brutus stabb , and as he pluck his cursed steel away , mark how the blood of caesar follow it , as rushing out of doors , to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knock , or no , for brutus , as you know , was caesar angel judge , o you gods , how dearly caesar loved him !
this was the most unkindest cut of all , for when the noble caesar saw him stab , ingratitude , more strong than traitors ' arms , quite vanquish him then burst his mighty heart , and , in his mantle muffling up his face , even at the base of pompey statua , which all the while ran blood , great caesar fell .
o , what a fall was there , my countrymen !
then i , and you , and all of us fell down , whilst bloody treason flourish over us .
o , now you weep , and , i perceive , you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops .
kind souls , what , weep you when you but behold our caesar vesture wounded ?
look you here , here is himself , marr , as you see , with traitors .
o piteous spectacle !
o noble caesar !
o woful day !
o traitors , villains !
o most bloody sight !
we will be revenged .
revenge !

seek !
burn !
fire !
kill !

let not a traitor live !
stay , countrymen .
peace there !
hear the noble antony .
we hear him , we follow him , we die with him .
good friends , sweet friends , let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny .
they that have done this deed are honourable what private griefs they have , alas , i know not , that made them do it they are wise and honourable , and will , no doubt , with reasons answer you .
i come not , friends , to steal away your hearts i am no orator , as brutus is , but , as you know me all , a plain blunt man , that love my friend , and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit , nor words , nor worth , action , nor utterance , nor the power of speech , to stir men blood i only speak right on , i tell you that which you yourselves do know , show you sweet caesar wounds , poor poor dumb mouths , and bid them speak for me but were i brutus , and brutus antony , there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny .
we mutiny .
we burn the house of brutus .
away , then !
come , seek the conspirators .
yet hear me , countrymen , yet hear me speak .
peace , ho !
hear antony .
most noble antony !
why , friends , you go to do you know not what wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves ?
alas , you know not i must tell you then you have forgot the will i told you of .
most true .
the will !
let stay and hear the will .
here is the will , and under caesar seal .
to every roman citizen he gives , to every several man , drachmas .
most noble caesar !
we revenge his death .
o royal caesar !
hear me with patience .
peace , ho !
moreover , he hath left you all his walks , his private arbours and orchards , on this side tiber , he hath left them you , and to your heirs for ever , common pleasures , to walk abroad , and recreate yourselves .
here was a caesar !
when comes such another ?
never , never .
come , away , away !
we burn his body in the holy place , and with the brands fire the traitors ' houses .
take up the body .
go fetch fire .
pluck down benches .

exeunt citizens with the body now let it work .
mischief , thou art afoot , take thou what course thou wilt !
enter a servant how now , fellow !
sir , octavius is already come to rome .
where is he ?
he and lepidus are at caesar house .
and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish .
fortune is merry , and in this mood will give us any thing .
i heard him say , brutus and cassius are rid like madmen through the gates of rome .
belike they had some notice of the people , how i had moved them .
bring me to octavius .
exeunt scene iii .
a street .
enter cinna the poet i dreamt that i did feast with caesar , and things unlucky charge my fantasy i have no will to wander forth of doors , yet something leads me forth .
enter citizens what is your name ?

answer every man directly .
ay , and briefly .
ay , and wisely .
ay , and truly , you were best .
what is my name ?
whither am i going ?
where do i dwell ?
am i a married man or a bachelor ?
then , to answer every man directly and briefly , wisely and truly wisely i say , i am a bachelor .
that as much as to say , they are fools that marry you bear me a bang for that , i fear .
proceed , directly .
directly , i am going to caesar funeral .
as a friend or an enemy ?
as a friend .
that matter is answered directly .
for your dwelling , briefly .
briefly , i dwell by the capitol .
your name , sir , truly .
truly , my name is cinna .
tear him to pieces , he a conspirator .
i am cinna the poet , i am cinna the poet .
tear him for his bad verses , tear him for his bad verses .
i am not cinna the conspirator .
it is no matter , his name cinna , pluck but his name out of his heart , and turn him going .
tear him , tear him !
come , brands ho !
to brutus ' , to cassius ' , burn all some to decius ' house , and some to casca , some to ligarius ' away , go !
exeunt act iv scene i .
a house in rome .
antony , octavius , and lepidus , seated at a table these many , then , shall die , their names are prick .
your brother too must die , consent you , lepidus ?
i do consent prick him down , antony .
upon condition publius shall not live , who is your sister son , mark antony .
he shall not live , look , with a spot i damn him .
but , lepidus , go you to caesar house , fetch the will hither , and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies .
what , shall i find you here ?
or here , or at the capitol .
exit lepidus this is a slight unmeritable man , meet to be sent on errands is it fit , the world divided , he should stand one of the three to share it ?
so you thought him , and took his voice who should be prick to die , in our black sentence and proscription .
octavius , i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honours on this man , to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads , he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold , to groan and sweat under the business , either led or driven , as we point the way , and having brought our treasure where we will , then take we down his load , and turn him off , like to the empty ass , to shake his ears , and graze in commons .
you may do your will , but he a tried and valiant soldier .
so is my horse , octavius , and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight , to wind , to stop , to run directly on , his corporal motion govern by my spirit .
and , in some taste , is lepidus but so , he must be taught and train and bid go forth , a fellow , one that feeds on abjects , orts and imitations , which , out of use and staled by other men , begin his fashion do not talk of him , but as a property .
and now , octavius , listen great things brutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined , our best friends made , our means stretch and let us presently go sit in council , how covert matters may be best disclosed , and open perils surest answered .
let us do so for we are at the stake , and bay about with many enemies , and some that smile have in their hearts , i fear , millions of mischiefs .
exeunt scene ii .
camp near sardis .
before brutus tent .
drum .
enter brutus , lucilius , lucius , and soldiers , titinius and pindarus meeting them stand , ho !
give the word , ho !
and stand .
what now , lucilius !
is cassius near ?
he is at hand , and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master .
he greets me well .
your master , pindarus , in his own change , or by ill officers , hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done , undone but , if he be at hand , i shall be satisfied .
i do not doubt but that my noble master will appear such as he is , full of regard and honour .
he is not doubted .
a word , lucilius , how he received you , let me be resolved .
with courtesy and with respect enough , but not with such familiar instances , nor with such free and friendly conference , as he hath used of old .
thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note , lucilius , when love begins to sicken and decay , it useth an enforced ceremony .
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith , but hollow men , like horses hot at hand , make gallant show and promise of their mettle , but when they should endure the bloody spur , they fall their crests , and , like deceitful jades , sink in the trial .
comes his army on ?
they mean this night in sardis to be quarter , the greater part , the horse in general , are come with cassius .
hark !
he is arrived .
low march within march gently on to meet him .
enter cassius and his powers stand , ho !
stand , ho !
speak the word along .
stand !
stand !
stand !
most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
judge me , you gods !
wrong i mine enemies ?
and , if not so , how should i wrong a brother ?
brutus , this sober form of yours hides wrongs , and when you do them cassius , be content .
speak your griefs softly i do know you well .
before the eyes of both our armies here , which should perceive nothing but love from us , let us not wrangle bid them move away , then in my tent , cassius , enlarge your griefs , and i will give you audience .
pindarus , bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground .
lucilius , do you the like , and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference .
let lucius and titinius guard our door .
exeunt scene iii .
brutus tent .
enter brutus and cassius that you have wrong me doth appear in this you have condemn and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians , wherein my letters , praying on his side , because i knew the man , were slighted off .
you wronged yourself to write in such a case .
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offence should bear his comment .
let me tell you , cassius , you yourself are much condemn to have an itching palm , to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers .
i an itching palm !
you know that you are brutus that speak this , or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .
the name of cassius honours this corruption , and chastisement doth therefore hide his head .
chastisement !
remember march , the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice ' sake ?
what villain touch his body , that did stab , and not for justice ?
what , shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers , shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes , and sell the mighty space of our large honours for so much trash as may be grasped thus ?
i had rather be a dog , and bay the moon , than such a roman .
brutus , bay not me , i not endure it you forget yourself , to hedge me in , i am a soldier , i , older in practise , abler than yourself to make conditions .
go to , you are not , cassius .
i am .
i say you are not .
urge me no more , i shall forget myself , have mind upon your health , tempt me no further .
away , slight man !
possible ?
hear me , for i will speak .
must i give way and room to your rash choler ?
shall i be frighted when a madman stares ?
o ye gods , ye gods !
must i endure all this ?
all this !
ay , more fret till your proud heart break , go show your slaves how choleric you are , and make your bondmen tremble .
must i budge ?
must i observe you ?
must i stand and crouch under your testy humour ?
by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen , though it do split you , for , from this day forth , i use you for my mirth , yea , for my laughter , when you are waspish .
is it come to this ?
you say you are a better soldier let it appear so , make your vaunting true , and it shall please me well for mine own part , i shall be glad to learn of noble men .
you wrong me every way , you wrong me , brutus , i said , an elder soldier , not a better did i say ' ?
if you did , i care not .
when caesar lived , he durst not thus have moved me .
peace , peace !
you durst not so have tempted him .
i durst not !
no .
what , durst not tempt him !
for your life you durst not !
do not presume too much upon my love , i may do that i shall be sorry for .
you have done that you should be sorry for .
there is no terror , cassius , in your threats , for i am arm so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind , which i respect not .
i did send to you for certain sums of gold , which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven , i had rather coin my heart , and drop my blood for drachmas , than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions , which you denied me was that done like cassius ?
should i have answer caius cassius so ?
when marcus brutus grows so covetous , to lock such rascal counters from his friends , be ready , gods , with all your thunderbolts , dash him to pieces !
i denied you not .
you did .
i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back .
brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friend infirmities , but brutus makes mine greater than they are .
i do not , till you practise them on me .
you love me not .
i do not like your faults .
a friendly eye could never see such faults .
a flatterer would not , though they do appear as huge as high olympus .
come , antony , and young octavius , come , revenge yourselves alone on cassius , for cassius is aweary of the world , hated by one he loves , braved by his brother , cheque like a bondman , all his faults observed , set in a , learn , and conn by rote , to cast into my teeth .
o , i could weep my spirit from mine eyes !
there is my dagger , and here my naked breast , within , a heart dearer than plutus ' mine , richer than gold if that thou a roman , take it forth , i , that denied thee gold , will give my heart strike , as thou didst at caesar , for , i know , when thou didst hate him worst , thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius .
sheathe your dagger be angry when you will , it shall have scope , do what you will , dishonour shall be humour .
o cassius , you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire , who , much enforced , shows a hasty spark , and straight is cold again .
hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus , when grief , and blood , vexeth him ?
when i spoke that , i was too .
do you confess so much ?
give me your hand .
and my heart too .
o brutus !
what the matter ?
have not you love enough to bear with me , when that rash humour which my mother gave me makes me forgetful ?
yes , cassius , and , from henceforth , when you are with your brutus , he think your mother chides , and leave you so .
within let me go in to see the generals , there is some grudge between , is not meet they be alone .
within you shall not come to them .
within nothing but death shall stay me .
enter poet , followed by lucilius , titinius , and lucius how now !
what the matter ?
for shame , you generals !
what do you mean ?
love , and be friends , as two such men should be , for i have seen more years , i sure , than ye .
ha , ha !
how vilely doth this cynic rhyme !
get you hence , sirrah , saucy fellow , hence !
bear with him , brutus , is his fashion .
i know his humour , when he knows his time what should the wars do with these jigging fools ?
companion , hence !
away , away , be gone .
exit poet lucilius and titinius , bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies .
and come yourselves , and bring messala with you immediately to us .
exeunt lucilius and titinius lucius , a bowl of wine !
exit lucius i did not think you could have been so angry .
o cassius , i am sick of many griefs .
of your philosophy you make no use , if you give place to accidental evils .
no man bears sorrow better .
portia is dead .
ha !
portia !
she is dead .
how i killing when i cross you so ?
o insupportable and touching loss !
upon what sickness ?
impatient of my absence , and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong for with her death that tidings came , with this she fell distract , and , her attendants absent , swallow fire .
and died so ?
even so .
o ye immortal gods !
lucius , with wine and taper speak no more of her .
give me a bowl of wine .
in this i bury all unkindness , cassius .
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
fill , lucius , till the wine the cup , i can not drink too much of brutus ' love .
come in , titinius !
exit lucius titinius , with messala welcome , good messala .
now sit we close about this taper here , and call in question our necessities .
portia , art thou gone ?
no more , i pray you .
messala , i have here received letters , that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power , bending their expedition toward philippi .
myself have letters of the selfsame tenor .
with what addition ?
that by proscription and bills of outlawry , octavius , antony , and lepidus , have put to death an hundred senators .
therein our letters do not well agree , mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions , cicero being one .
cicero one !
cicero is dead , and by that order of proscription .
had you your letters from your wife , my lord ?
no , messala .
nor nothing in your letters writ of her ?
nothing , messala .
that , methinks , is strange .
why ask you ?
hear you aught of her in yours ?
no , my lord .
now , as you are a roman , tell me true .
then like a roman bear the truth i tell for certain she is dead , and by strange manner .
why , farewell , portia .
we must die , messala with meditating that she must die once , i have the patience to endure it now .
even so great men great losses should endure .
i have as much of this in art as you , but yet my nature could not bear it so .
well , to our work alive .
what do you think of marching to philippi presently ?
i do not think it good .
your reason ?
this it is is better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means , weary his soldiers , doing himself offence , whilst we , lying still , are full of rest , defense , and nimbleness .
good reasons must , of force , give place to better .
the people philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection , for they have grudged us contribution the enemy , marching along by them , by them shall make a fuller number up , come on refresh , , and encouraged , from which advantage shall we cut him off , if at philippi we do face him there , these people at our back .
hear me , good brother .
under your pardon .
you must note beside , that we have tried the utmost of our friends , our legions are , our cause is ripe the enemy increaseth every day , we , at the height , are ready to decline .
there is a tide in the affairs of men , which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune , omitted , all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries .
on such a full sea are we now afloat , and we must take the current when it serves , or lose our ventures .
then , with your will , go on , we along ourselves , and meet them at philippi .
the deep of night is crept upon our talk , and nature must obey necessity , which we will niggard with a little rest .
there is no more to say ?
no more .
good night early will we rise , and hence .
lucius !
enter lucius my gown .
exit lucius farewell , good messala good night , titinius .
noble , noble cassius , good night , and good repose .
o my dear brother !
this was an ill beginning of the night never come such division our souls !
let it not , brutus .
every thing is well .
good night , my lord .
good night , good brother .
good night , lord brutus .
farewell , every one .
exeunt all but brutus lucius , with the gown give me the gown .
where is thy instrument ?
here in the tent .
what , thou drowsily ?
poor knave , i blame thee not , thou art .
call claudius and some other of my men i have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
varro and claudius !
enter varro and claudius calls my lord ?
i pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep , it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius .
so please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .
i will not have it so lie down , good sirs , it may be i shall otherwise bethink me .
look , lucius , here the book i sought for so , i put it in the pocket of my gown .
varro and claudius lie down i was sure your lordship did not give it me .
bear with me , good boy , i am much forgetful .
canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile , and touch thy instrument a strain or two ?
ay , my lord , a please you .
it does , my boy i trouble thee too much , but thou art willing .
it is my duty , sir .
i should not urge thy duty past thy might , i know young bloods look for a time of rest .
i have slept , my lord , already .
it was well done , and thou shalt sleep again , i will not hold thee long if i do live , i will be good to thee .
music , and a song this is a sleepy tune .
o murderous slumber , thou thy leaden mace upon my boy , that plays thee music ?
gentle knave , good night , i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee if thou dost nod , thou thy instrument , i take it from thee , and , good boy , good night .
let me see , let me see , is not the leaf turn down where i left reading ?
here it is , i think .
enter the ghost of caesar how ill this taper burns !
ha !
who comes here ?
i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition .
it comes upon me .
art thou any thing ?
art thou some god , some angel , or some devil , that makest my blood cold and my hair to stare ?
speak to me what thou art .
thy evil spirit , brutus .
why comest thou ?
to tell thee thou shalt see me at philippi .
well , then i shall see thee again ?
ay , at philippi .
why , i will see thee at philippi , then .
exit ghost now i have taken heart thou vanishest ill spirit , i would hold more talk with thee .
boy , lucius !
varro !
claudius !
sirs , awake !
claudius !
the strings , my lord , are false .
he thinks he still is at his instrument .
lucius , awake !
my lord ?
didst thou dream , lucius , that thou so criedst out ?
my lord , i do not know that i did cry .
yes , that thou didst didst thou see any thing ?
nothing , my lord .
sleep again , lucius .
sirrah claudius !
to varro fellow thou , awake !
my lord ?
my lord ?
why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ?
did we , my lord ?
ay saw you any thing ?
no , my lord , i saw nothing .
nor i , my lord .
go and commend me to my brother cassius , bid him set on his powers betimes before , and we will follow .
it shall be done , my lord .
exeunt act v scene i .
the plains of philippi .
enter octavius , antony , and their army now , antony , our hopes are answered you said the enemy would not come down , but keep the hills and upper regions , it proves not so their battles are at hand , they mean to warn us at philippi here , answering before we do demand of them .
tut , i am in their bosoms , and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places , and come down with fearful bravery , thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage , but is not so .
enter a messenger prepare you , generals the enemy comes on in gallant show , their bloody sign of battle is hung out , and something to be done immediately .
octavius , lead your battle softly on , upon the left hand of the even field .
upon the right hand i , keep thou the left .
why do you cross me in this exigent ?
i do not cross you , but i will do so .
march drum .
enter brutus , cassius , and their army , lucilius , titinius , messala , and others they stand , and would have parley .
stand fast , titinius we must out and talk .
mark antony , shall we give sign of battle ?
no , caesar , we will answer on their charge .
make forth , the generals would have some words .
stir not until the signal .
words before blows is it so , countrymen ?
not that we love words better , as you do .
good words are better than bad strokes , octavius .
in your bad strokes , brutus , you give good words witness the hole you made in caesar heart , crying live !
hail , caesar ! '
antony , the posture of your blows are yet unknown , but for your words , they rob the hybla bees , and leave them honeyless .
not stingless too .
o , yes , and soundless too , for you have their buzzing , antony , and very wisely threat before you sting .
villains , you did not so , when your vile daggers hack one another in the sides of caesar you show your teeth like apes , and fawn like hounds , and bow like bondmen , kissing caesar feet , whilst damned casca , like a cur , behind struck caesar on the neck .
o you flatterers !
flatterers !
now , brutus , thank yourself this tongue had not offended so , if cassius might have ruled .
come , come , the cause if arguing make us sweat , the proof of it will turn to redder drops .
look , i draw a sword against conspirators , when think you that the sword goes up again ?
never , till caesar three and thirty wounds be well avenged , or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors .
caesar , thou canst not die by traitors ' hands , unless thou them with thee .
so i hope , i was not born to die on brutus ' sword .
o , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , young man , thou couldst not die more honourable .
a peevish schoolboy , worthless of such honour , join with a masker and a reveller !
old cassius still !
come , antony , away !
defiance , traitors , hurl we in your teeth if you dare fight , come to the field , if not , when you have stomachs .
exeunt octavius , antony , and their army why , now , blow wind , swell billow and swim bark !
the storm is up , and all is on the hazard .
ho , lucilius !
hark , a word with you .
standing forth my lord ?
brutus and lucilius converse apart messala !
standing forth what says my general ?
messala , this is my , as this very day was cassius born .
give me thy hand , messala be thou my witness that against my will , as pompey was , am i compell to set upon one battle all our liberties .
you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind , and partly credit things that do presage .
coming from sardis , on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell , and there they perch , gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands , who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone , and in their steads do ravens , crows and kites , fly our heads and downward look on us , as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal , under which our army lies , ready to give up the ghost .
believe not so .
i but believe it partly , for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly .
even so , lucilius .
now , most noble brutus , the gods stand friendly , that we may , lovers in peace , lead on our days to age !
but since the affairs of men rest still incertain , let reason with the worst that may befall .
if we do lose this battle , then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determined to do ?
even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself , i know not how , but i do find it cowardly and vile , for fear of what might fall , so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below .
then , if we lose this battle , you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome ?
no , cassius , no think not , thou noble roman , that ever brutus will go bound to rome , he bears too great a mind .
but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun , and whether we shall meet again i know not .
therefore our everlasting farewell take for ever , and for ever , farewell , cassius !
if we do meet again , why , we shall smile , if not , why then , this parting was well made .
for ever , and for ever , farewell , brutus !
if we do meet again , we smile indeed , if not , is true this parting was well made .
why , then , lead on .
o , that a man might know the end of this day business ere it come !
but it sufficeth that the day will end , and then the end is known .
come , ho !
away !

loud alarum let them set on at once , for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius ' wing , and sudden push gives them the overthrow .
ride , ride , messala let them all come down .

alarums .
enter cassius and titinius o , look , titinius , look , the villains fly !
myself have to mine own turn enemy this ensign here of mine was turning back , i slew the coward , and did take it from him .
o cassius , brutus gave the word too early , who , having some advantage on octavius , took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil , whilst we by antony are all enclosed .
enter pindarus fly further off , my lord , fly further off , mark antony is in your tents , my lord fly , therefore , noble cassius , fly far off .
this hill is far enough .
look , look , titinius , are those my tents where i perceive the fire ?
they are , my lord .
titinius , if thou lovest me , mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurs in him , till he have brought thee up to yonder troops , and here again , that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy .
i will be here again , even with a thought .
exit go , pindarus , get higher on that hill , my sight was ever thick , regard titinius , and tell me what thou notest about the field .
pindarus ascends the hill this day i breathed first time is come round , and where i did begin , there shall i end , my life is run his compass .
sirrah , what news ?
above o my lord !
what news ?
above titinius is enclosed round about with horsemen , that make to him on the spur , yet he spurs on .
now they are almost on him .
now , titinius !
now some light .
o , he lights too .
he .
shout and , hark !
they shout for joy .
come down , behold no more .
o , coward that i am , to live so long , to see my best friend before my face !
pindarus descends come hither , sirrah in parthia did i take thee prisoner , and then i swore thee , saving of thy life , that whatsoever i did bid thee do , thou shouldst attempt it .
come now , keep thine oath , now be a freeman and with this good sword , that ran through caesar bowels , search this bosom .
stand not to answer here , take thou the hilts , and , when my face is cover , as is now , guide thou the sword .
pindarus stabs him caesar , thou art revenged , even with the sword that kill thee .
dies so , i am free , yet would not so have been , durst i have done my will .
o cassius , far from this country pindarus shall run , where never roman shall take note of him .
exit titinius with messala it is but change , titinius , for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus ' power , as cassius ' legions are by antony .
these tidings will well comfort cassius .
where did you leave him ?
all disconsolate , with pindarus his bondman , on this hill .
is not that he t hat lies upon the ground ?
he lies not like the living .
o my heart !
is not that he ?
no , this was he , messala , but cassius is no more .
o setting sun , as in thy red rays thou dost sink , so in his red blood cassius ' day is set , the sun of rome is set !
our day is gone , clouds , dews , and dangers come , our deeds are done !
mistrust of my success hath done this deed .
mistrust of good success hath done this deed .
o hateful error , melancholy child , why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men the things that are not ?
o error , soon conceived , thou never comest unto a happy birth , but the mother that engender thee !
what , pindarus !
where art thou , pindarus ?
seek him , titinius , whilst i go to meet the noble brutus , thrusting this report into his ears , i may say , thrusting it , for piercing steel and darts envenomed shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus as tidings of this sight .
hie you , messala , and i will seek for pindarus the while .
exit messala why didst thou send me forth , brave cassius ?
did i not meet thy friends ?
and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory , and bid me give it thee ?
didst thou not hear their shouts ?
alas , thou hast misconstrued every thing !
but , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow , thy brutus bid me give it thee , and i will do his bidding .
brutus , come apace , and see how i regarded caius cassius .
by your leave , gods this is a roman part come , cassius ' sword , and find titinius ' heart .
kills himself alarum .
messala , with brutus , cato , strato , volumnius , and lucilius where , where , messala , doth his body lie ?
lo , yonder , and titinius mourning it .
titinius ' face is upward .
he is slain .
o julius caesar , thou art mighty yet !
thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails .
low alarums brave titinius !
look , whether he have not crown dead cassius !
are yet two romans living such as these ?
the last of all the romans , fare thee well !
it is impossible that ever rome should breed thy fellow .
friends , i owe more tears to this dead man than you shall see me pay .
i shall find time , cassius , i shall find time .
come , therefore , and to thasos send his body his funerals shall not be in our camp , lest it discomfort us .
lucilius , come , and come , young cato , let us to the field .
labeo and flavius , set our battles on is three , and , romans , yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight .
exeunt scene iv .

enter fighting , soldiers of both armies , then brutus , cato , lucilius , and others yet , countrymen , o , yet hold up your heads !
what bastard doth not ?
who will go with me ?
i will proclaim my name about the field i am the son of marcus cato , ho !
a foe to tyrants , and my country friend , i am the son of marcus cato , ho !
and i am brutus , marcus brutus , i , brutus , my country friend , know me for brutus !
exit o young and noble cato , art thou down ?
why , now thou diest as bravely as titinius , and mayst be honour , being cato son .
yield , or thou diest .
only i yield to die there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight , offering money kill brutus , and be honour in his death .
we must not .
a noble prisoner !
room , ho !
tell antony , brutus is .
i tell the news .
here comes the general .
enter antony brutus is , brutus is , my lord .
where is he ?
safe , antony , brutus is safe enough i dare assure thee that no enemy shall ever take alive the noble brutus the gods defend him from so great a shame !
when you do find him , or alive or dead , he will be found like brutus , like himself .
this is not brutus , friend , but , i assure you , a prize no less in worth keep this man safe , give him all kindness i had rather have such men my friends than enemies .
go on , and see whether brutus be alive or dead , and bring us word unto octavius ' tent how every thing is chanced .
exeunt scene another part of the field .
enter brutus , dardanius , clitus , strato , and volumnius come , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock .
statilius show the , but , my lord , he came not back he is or or slain .
sit thee down , clitus slaying is the word , it is a deed in fashion .
hark thee , clitus .
whispers what , i , my lord ?
no , not for all the world .
peace then !
no words .
i rather kill myself .
hark thee , dardanius .
whispers shall i do such a deed ?
o dardanius !
o clitus !
what ill request did brutus make to thee ?
to kill him , clitus .
look , he meditates .
now is that noble vessel full of grief , that it runs over even at his eyes .
come hither , good volumnius , list a word .
what says my lord ?
why , this , volumnius the ghost of caesar hath appear to me two several times by night , at sardis once , and , this last night , here in philippi fields i know my hour is come .
not so , my lord .
nay , i am sure it is , volumnius .
thou seest the world , volumnius , how it goes , our enemies have beat us to the pit low alarums it is more worthy to leap in ourselves , than tarry till they push us .
good volumnius , thou that we two went to school together even for that our love of old , i prithee , hold thou my , whilst i run on it .
that not an office for a friend , my lord .
alarum still fly , fly , my lord , there is no tarrying here .
farewell to you , and you , and you , volumnius .
strato , thou hast been all this while asleep , farewell to thee too , strato .
countrymen , my heart doth joy that yet in all my life i found no man but he was true to me .
i shall have glory by this losing day more than octavius and mark antony by this vile conquest shall attain unto .
so fare you well at once , for brutus ' tongue hath almost ended his life history night hangs upon mine eyes , my bones would rest , that have but labour to attain this hour .
alarum .
cry within , , fly , fly ! '
fly , my lord , fly .
hence !
i will follow .
exeunt clitus , dardanius , and volumnius i prithee , strato , stay thou by thy lord thou art a fellow of a good respect , thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it hold then my sword , and turn away thy face , while i do run upon it .
wilt thou , strato ?
give me your hand first .
fare you well , my lord .
farewell , good strato .
runs on his sword caesar , now be still i kill not thee with half so good a will .
dies alarum .
retreat .
enter octavius , antony , messala , lucilius , and the army what man is that ?
my master man .
strato , where is thy master ?
free from the bondage you are in , messala the conquerors can but make a fire of him , for brutus only overcame himself , and no man else hath honour by his death .
so brutus should be found .
i thank thee , brutus , that thou hast proved lucilius ' saying true .
all that served brutus , i will entertain them .
fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?
ay , if messala will prefer me to you .
do so , good messala .
how died my master , strato ?
i held the sword , and he did run on it .
octavius , then take him to follow thee , that did the latest service to my master .
this was the noblest roman of them all all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar , he only , in a general honest thought and common good to all , made one of them .
his life was gentle , and the elements so mix in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world was a man ! '
according to his virtue let us use him , with all respect and rites of burial .
within my tent his bones shall lie , most like a soldier , order honourably .
so call the field to rest , and let away , to part the glories of this happy day .
exeunt act i scene i .
king lear palace .
enter kent , gloucester , and edmund i thought the king had more affected the duke of albany than cornwall .
it did always seem so to us but now , in the division of the kingdom , it appears not which of the dukes he values most , for equalities are so weighed , that curiosity in neither can make choice of either moiety .
is not this your son , my lord ?
his breeding , sir , hath been at my charge i have so often blushed to acknowledge him , that now i am brazed to it .
i can not conceive you .
sir , this young fellow mother could whereupon she grew , and had , indeed , sir , a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed .
do you smell a fault ?
i can not wish the fault undone , the issue of it being so proper .
but i have , sir , a son by order of law , some year elder than this , who yet is no dearer in my account though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for , yet was his mother fair , there was good sport at his making , and the whoreson must be acknowledged .
do you know this noble gentleman , edmund ?
no , my lord .
my lord of kent remember him hereafter as my honourable friend .
my services to your lordship .
i must love you , and sue to know you better .
sir , i shall study deserving .
he hath been out nine years , and away he shall again .
the king is coming .
sennet .
enter king lear , cornwall , albany , goneril , regan , cordelia , and attendants attend the lords of france and burgundy , gloucester .
i shall , my liege .
exeunt gloucester and edmund meantime we shall express our darker purpose .
give me the map there .
know that we have divided in three our kingdom and is our fast intent to shake all cares and business from our age , conferring them on younger strengths , while we unburthen crawl toward death .
our son of cornwall , and you , our no less loving son of albany , we have this hour a constant will to publish our daughters ' several dowers , that future strife may be prevented now .
the princes , france and burgundy , great rivals in our youngest daughter love , long in our court have made their amorous sojourn , and here are to be answer .
tell me , my daughters , since now we will divest us both of rule , interest of territory , cares of state , which of you shall we say doth love us most ?
that we our largest bounty may extend where nature doth with merit challenge .
goneril , our , speak first .
sir , i love you more than words can wield the matter , dearer than , space , and liberty , beyond what can be valued , rich or rare , no less than life , with grace , health , beauty , honour , as much as child loved , or father found , a love that makes breath poor , and speech unable , beyond all manner of so much i love you .
aside what shall cordelia do ?
love , and be silent .
of all these bounds , even from this line to this , with shadowy forests and with champains rich , with plenteous rivers and meads , we make thee lady to thine and albany issue be this perpetual .
what says our second daughter , our dearest regan , wife to cornwall ?
speak .
sir , i am made of the metal that my sister is , and prize me at her worth .
in my true heart i find she names my very deed of love , only she comes too short that i profess myself an enemy to all other joys , which the most precious square of sense possesses , and find i am alone felicitate in your dear highness ' love .
aside then poor cordelia !
and yet not so , since , i am sure , my love more richer than my tongue .
to thee and thine hereditary ever remain this ample third of our fair kingdom , no less in space , validity , and pleasure , than that conferr on goneril .
now , our joy , although the last , not least , to whose young love the vines of france and milk of burgundy strive to be interess , what can you say to draw a third more opulent than your sisters ?
speak .
nothing , my lord .
nothing !
nothing .
nothing will come of nothing speak again .
unhappy that i am , i can not heave my heart into my mouth i love your majesty according to my bond , nor more nor less .
how , how , cordelia !
mend your speech a little , lest it may mar your fortunes .
good my lord , you have begot me , bred me , loved me i return those duties back as are right fit , obey you , love you , and most honour you .
why have my sisters husbands , if they say they love you all ?
haply , when i shall wed , that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry half my love with him , half my care and duty sure , i shall never marry like my sisters , to love my father all .
but goes thy heart with this ?
ay , good my lord .
so young , and so untender ?
so young , my lord , and true .
let it be so , thy truth , then , be thy dower for , by the sacred radiance of the sun , the mysteries of hecate , and the night , by all the operation of the orbs from whom we do exist , and cease to be , here i disclaim all my paternal care , propinquity and property of blood , and as a stranger to my heart and me hold thee , from this , for ever .
the barbarous scythian , or he that makes his generation messes to gorge his appetite , shall to my bosom be as well neighbour , pitied , and relieved , as thou my sometime daughter .
good my liege , peace , kent !
come not between the dragon and his wrath .
i loved her most , and thought to set my rest on her kind nursery .
hence , and avoid my sight !
so be my grave my peace , as here i give her father heart from her !
call france , who stirs ?
call burgundy .
cornwall and albany , with my two daughters ' dowers digest this third let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her .
i do invest you jointly with my power , , and all the large effects that troop with majesty .
ourself , by monthly course , with reservation of an hundred knights , by you to be sustain , shall our abode make with you by due turns .
only we still retain the name , and all the additions to a king , the sway , revenue , execution of the rest , beloved sons , be yours which to confirm , this coronet part betwixt you .
giving the crown royal lear , whom i have ever honour as my king , loved as my father , as my master follow , as my great patron thought on in my prayers , the bow is bent and drawn , make from the shaft .
let it fall rather , though the fork invade the region of my heart be kent unmannerly , when lear is mad .
what wilt thou do , old man ?
thou that duty shall have dread to speak , when power to flattery bows ?
to plainness honour bound , when majesty stoops to folly .
reverse thy doom , and , in thy best consideration , cheque this hideous rashness answer my life my judgment , thy youngest daughter does not love thee least , nor are those whose low sound reverbs no hollowness .
kent , on thy life , no more .
my life i never held but as a pawn to wage against thy enemies , nor fear to lose it , thy safety being the motive .
out of my sight !
see better , lear , and let me still remain the true blank of thine eye .
now , by apollo , now , by apollo , king , thou thy gods in vain .
o , vassal !
miscreant !
laying his hand on his sword dear sir , forbear .
do kill thy physician , and the fee bestow upon thy foul disease .
revoke thy doom , or , whilst i can vent clamour from my throat , i tell thee thou dost evil .
hear me , recreant !
on thine allegiance , hear me !
since thou hast sought to make us break our vow , which we durst never yet , and with strain pride to come between our sentence and our power , which nor our nature nor our place can bear , our potency made good , take thy reward .
five days we do allot thee , for provision to shield thee from diseases of the world , and on the sixth to turn thy hated back upon our kingdom if , on the tenth day following , thy banish trunk be found in our dominions , the moment is thy death .
away !
by jupiter , this shall not be revoked .
fare thee well , king sith thus thou wilt appear , freedom lives hence , and banishment is here .
to cordelia the gods to their dear shelter take thee , maid , that justly , and hast most rightly said !
to regan and goneril and your large speeches may your deeds approve , that good effects may spring from words of love .
thus kent , o princes , bids you all adieu , he shape his old course in a country new .
exit flourish .
gloucester , with king of france , burgundy , and attendants here france and burgundy , my noble lord .
my lord of burgundy .
we first address towards you , who with this king hath rivall for our daughter what , in the least , will you require in present dower with her , or cease your quest of love ?
most royal majesty , i crave no more than what your highness offer , nor will you tender less .
right noble burgundy , when she was dear to us , we did hold her so , but now her price is .
sir , there she stands if aught within that little seeming substance , or all of it , with our displeasure pieced , and nothing more , may fitly like your grace , she there , and she is yours .
i know no answer .
will you , with those infirmities she owes , unfriended , to our hate , dower with our curse , and stranger with our oath , take her , or leave her ?
pardon me , royal sir , election makes not up on such conditions .
then leave her , sir , for , by the power that made me , i tell you all her wealth .
to king of france for you , great king , i would not from your love make such a stray , to match you where i hate , therefore beseech you to avert your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed almost to acknowledge hers .
this is most strange , that she , that even but now was your best object , the argument of your praise , balm of your age , most best , most dearest , should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous , to dismantle so many folds of favour .
sure , her offence must be of such unnatural degree , that monsters it , or your affection into taint which to believe of her , must be a faith that reason without miracle could never plant in me .
i yet beseech your majesty , if for i want that glib and oily art , to speak and purpose not , since what i well intend , i before i speak , that you make known it is no vicious blot , murder , or foulness , no unchaste action , or dishonour step , that hath deprived me of your grace and favour , but even for want of that for which i am richer , a eye , and such a tongue as i am glad i have not , though not to have it hath lost me in your liking .
better thou hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better .
is it but this , a tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do ?
my lord of burgundy , what say you to the lady ?
love not love when it is mingled with regards that stand aloof from the entire point .
will you have her ?
she is herself a dowry .
royal lear , give but that portion which yourself proposed , and here i take cordelia by the hand , duchess of burgundy .
nothing i have sworn , i am firm .
i am sorry , then , you have so lost a father that you must lose a husband .
peace be with burgundy !
since that respects of fortune are his love , i shall not be his wife .
fairest cordelia , that art most rich , being poor , most choice , forsaken , and most loved , despised !
thee and thy virtues here i seize upon be it lawful i take up what cast away .
gods , gods !
is strange that from their neglect my love should kindle to inflamed respect .
thy dowerless daughter , king , thrown to my chance , is queen of us , of ours , and our fair france not all the dukes of waterish burgundy can buy this unprized precious maid of me .
bid them farewell , cordelia , though unkind thou losest here , a better where to find .
thou hast her , france let her be thine , for we have no such daughter , nor shall ever see that face of hers again .
therefore be gone without our grace , our love , our benison .
come , noble burgundy .
flourish .
exeunt all but king of france , goneril , regan , and cordelia bid farewell to your sisters .
the jewels of our father , with wash eyes cordelia leaves you i know you what you are , and like a sister am most loath to call your faults as they are named .
use well our father to your professed bosoms i commit him but yet , alas , stood i within his grace , i would prefer him to a better place .
so , farewell to you both .
prescribe not us our duties .
let your study be to content your lord , who hath received you at fortune alms .
you have obedience scanted , and well are worth the want that you have wanted .
time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides who cover faults , at last shame them derides .
well may you prosper !
come , my fair cordelia .
exeunt king of france and cordelia sister , it is not a little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both .
i think our father will hence .
that most certain , and with you , next month with us .
you see how full of changes his age is , the observation we have made of it hath not been little he always loved our sister most , and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly .
is the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself .
the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash , then must we look to receive from his age , not alone the imperfections of condition , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them .
such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent banishment .
there is further compliment of leavetaking between france and him .
pray you , let hit together if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears , this last surrender of his will but offend us .
we shall further think o .
we must do something , and i ' the heat .
exeunt scene ii .
the earl of gloucester castle .
enter edmund , with a letter thou , nature , art my goddess , to thy law my services are bound .
wherefore should i stand in the plague of custom , and permit the curiosity of nations to deprive me , for that i am some twelve or fourteen lag of a brother ?
why bastard ?
wherefore base ?
when my dimensions are as well compact , my mind as generous , and my shape as true , as honest madam issue ?
why brand they us with base ?
with baseness ?
bastardy ?
base , base ?
who , in the lusty stealth of nature , take more composition and fierce quality than doth , within a dull , stale , tired bed , go to the creating a whole tribe of fops , got asleep and wake ?
well , then , legitimate edgar , i must have your land our father love is to the bastard edmund as to the legitimate fine word , legitimate !
well , my legitimate , if this letter speed , and my invention thrive , edmund the base shall top the legitimate .
i grow , i prosper now , gods , stand up for bastards !
enter gloucester kent banish thus !
and france in choler parted !
and the king gone !
subscribed his power !
confined to exhibition !
all this done upon the gad !
edmund , how now !
what news ?
so please your lordship , none .
putting up the letter why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter ?
i know no news , my lord .
what paper were you reading ?
nothing , my lord .
no ?
what needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket ?
the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself .
let see come , if it be nothing , i shall not need spectacles .
i beseech you , sir , pardon me it is a letter from my brother , that i have not all , and for so much as i have perused , i find it not fit for your .
give me the letter , sir .
i shall offend , either to detain or give it .
the contents , as in part i understand them , are to blame .
let see , let see .
i hope , for my brother justification , he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue .
reads policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times , keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness can not relish them .
i begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny , who sways , not as it hath power , but as it is suffered .
come to me , that of this i may speak more .
if our father would sleep till i waked him , you should half his revenue for ever , and live the beloved of your brother , edgar . '
hum conspiracy ! till i waked him , you should enjoy half his revenue , ' my son edgar !
had he a hand to write this ?
a heart and brain to breed it in ? when came this to you ?
who brought it ?
it was not brought me , my lord , there the cunning of it , i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
you know the character to be your brother ?
if the matter were good , my lord , i durst swear it were his , but , in respect of that , i would fain think it were not .
it is his .
it is his hand , my lord , but i hope his heart is not in the contents .
hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business ?
never , my lord but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit , that , sons at perfect age , and fathers declining , the father should be as ward to the son , and the son manage his revenue .
o villain , villain !
his very opinion in the letter !
abhorred villain !
unnatural , detested , brutish villain !
worse than brutish !
go , sirrah , seek him , i apprehend him abominable villain !
where is he ?
i do not well know , my lord .
if it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent , you shall run a certain course , where , if you violently proceed against him , mistaking his purpose , it would make a great gap in your own honour , and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience .
i dare pawn down my life for him , that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honour , and to no further pretence of danger .
think you so ?
if your honour judge it meet , i will place you where you shall hear us confer of this , and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction , and that without any further delay than this very evening .
he can not be such a monster nor is not , sure .
to his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him .
heaven and earth !
edmund , seek him out wind me into him , i pray you frame the business after your own wisdom .
i would unstate myself , to be in a due resolution .
i will seek him , sir , presently convey the business as i shall find means and acquaint you withal .
these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus , yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects love cools , friendship falls off , brothers divide in cities , mutinies , in countries , discord , in palaces , treason , and the bond cracked son and father .
this villain of mine comes under the prediction , there son against father the king falls from bias of nature , there father against child .
we have seen the best of our time machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders , follow us disquietly to our graves .
find out this villain , edmund , it shall lose thee nothing , do it carefully .
and the noble and kent banished !
his offence , honesty !
is strange .
exit this is the excellent foppery of the world , that , when we are sick in fortune , often the surfeit of our own behavior , we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and the stars as if we were villains by necessity , fools by heavenly compulsion , knaves , thieves , and treachers , by spherical predominance , drunkards , liars , and adulterers , by an enforced obedience of planetary influence , and all that we are evil in , by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion of whoremaster man , to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star !
my father compounded with my mother under the dragon tail , and my nativity was under ursa major , so that it follows , i am rough and lecherous .
tut , i should have been that i am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing .
edgar enter edgar and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy my cue is villanous melancholy , with a sigh like tom o ' bedlam .
o , these eclipses do portend these divisions !
fa , sol , la , mi .
how now , brother edmund !
what serious contemplation are you in ?
i am thinking , brother , of a prediction i read this other day , what should follow these eclipses .
do you busy yourself about that ?
i promise you , the effects he writes of succeed unhappily , as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent , death , dearth , dissolutions of ancient amities , divisions in state , menaces and maledictions against king and nobles , needless diffidences , banishment of friends , dissipation of cohorts , nuptial breaches , and i know not what .
how long have you been a sectary astronomical ?
come , come , when saw you my father last ?
why , the night gone by .
spake you with him ?
ay , two hours together .
parted you in good terms ?
found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance ?
none at all .
bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure , which at this instant so rageth in him , that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay .
some villain hath done me wrong .
that my fear .
i pray you , have a continent forbearance till the spied of his rage goes slower , and , as i say , retire with me to my lodging , from whence i will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak pray ye , go , there my key if you do stir abroad , go armed .
armed , brother !
brother , i advise you to the best , go armed i am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards you i have told you what i have seen and heard , but faintly , nothing like the image and horror of it pray you , away .
shall i hear from you anon ?
i do serve you in this business .
exit edgar a credulous father !
and a brother noble , whose nature is so far from doing harms , that he suspects none on whose foolish honesty my practises ride easy !
i see the business .
let me , if not by birth , have lands by wit all with me meet that i can fashion fit .
exit scene iii .
the duke of albany palace .
enter goneril , and oswald , her steward did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool ?
yes , madam .
by day and night he wrongs me , every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other , that sets us all at odds i not endure it his knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us on every trifle .
when he returns from hunting , i will not speak with him , say i am sick if you come slack of former services , you shall do well , the fault of it i answer .

idle old man , that still would manage those authorities that he hath given away !
now , by my life , old fools are babes again , and must be used with cheques as flatteries , when they are seen abused .
remember what i tell you .
well , madam .
and let his knights have colder looks among you , what grows of it , no matter , advise your fellows so i would breed from hence occasions , and i shall , that i may speak i write straight to my sister , to hold my very course .
prepare for dinner .
exeunt scene iv .
a hall in the same .
enter kent , disguised if but as well i other accents borrow , that can my speech defuse , my good intent may carry through itself to that full issue for which i razed my likeness .

horns within .
enter king lear , knights , and attendants let me not stay a jot for dinner , go get it ready .
exit an attendant how now !
what art thou ?
a man , sir .
what dost thou profess ?
what wouldst thou with us ?
i do profess to be no less than i seem , to serve him truly that will put me in trust to love him that is honest , to converse with him that is wise , and says little , to fear judgment , to fight when i can not choose , and to eat no fish .
what art thou ?
a very fellow , and as poor as the king .
if thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a king , thou art poor enough .
what wouldst thou ?
service .
who wouldst thou serve ?
you .
dost thou know me , fellow ?
no , sir , but you have that in your countenance which i would fain call master .
what that ?
authority .
what services canst thou do ?
i can keep honest counsel , ride , run , mar a curious tale in telling it , and deliver a plain message bluntly that which ordinary men are fit for , i am qualified in , and the best of me is diligence .
how old art thou ?
not so young , sir , to love a woman for singing , nor so old to dote on her for any thing i have years on my back forty eight .
follow me , thou shalt serve me if i like thee no worse after dinner , i will not part from thee yet .

he says , my lord , your daughter is not well .
why came not the slave back to me when i called him .
sir , he answered me in the roundest manner , he would not .
he would not !
my lord , i know not what the matter is , but , to my judgment , your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont , there a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and your daughter .
ha !
sayest thou so ?
i beseech you , pardon me , my lord , if i be mistaken , for my duty can not be silent when i think your highness wronged .
thou but rememberest me of mine own conception i have perceived a most faint neglect of late , which i have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness i will look further .
but where my fool ?
i have not seen him this two days .
since my young lady going into france , sir , the fool hath much pined away .
no more of that , i have noted it well .
go you , and tell my daughter i would speak with her .
exit an attendant go you , call hither my fool .
exit an attendant oswald o , you sir , you , come you hither , sir who am i , sir ?
my lady father .
lady father ' !
my lord knave your whoreson dog !
you slave !
you cur !
i am none of these , my lord , i beseech your pardon .
do you bandy looks with me , you rascal ?
striking him i not be struck , my lord .
nor tripped neither , you base football player .
tripping up his heels i thank thee , fellow , thou servest me , and i love thee .
come , sir , arise , away !
i teach you differences away , away !
if you will measure your lubber length again , tarry but away !
go to , have you wisdom ?
so .
pushes oswald out now , my friendly knave , i thank thee there earnest of thy service .
giving kent money enter fool let me hire him too here my coxcomb .
offering kent his cap how now , my pretty knave !
how dost thou ?
sirrah , you were best take my coxcomb .
why , fool ?
why , for taking one part that out of favour nay , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits , catch cold shortly there , take my coxcomb why , this fellow has banished two on daughters , and did the third a blessing against his will , if thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb .
how now , nuncle !
would i had two coxcombs and two daughters !
why , my boy ?
if i gave them all my living , keep my coxcombs myself .
there mine , beg another of thy daughters .
take heed , sirrah , the whip .
truth a dog must to kennel , he must be whipped out , when lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink .
a pestilent gall to me !
sirrah , i teach thee a speech .
do .
mark it , nuncle have more than thou showest , speak less than thou knowest , lend less than thou owest , ride more than thou goest , learn more than thou trowest , set less than thou throwest , leave thy drink and thy whore , and keep , and thou shalt have more than two tens to a score .
this is nothing , fool .
then is like the breath of an unfee lawyer , you gave me nothing .
can you make no use of nothing , nuncle ?
why , no , boy , nothing can be made out of nothing .
to kent prithee , tell him , so much the rent of his land comes to he will not believe a fool .
a bitter fool !
dost thou know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet fool ?
no , lad , teach me .
that lord that counsell thee to give away thy land , come place him here by me , do thou for him stand the sweet and bitter fool will presently appear , the one in motley here , the other found out there .
dost thou call me fool , boy ?
all thy other titles thou hast given away , that thou wast born with .
this is not altogether fool , my lord .
no , faith , lords and great men will not let me , if i had a monopoly out , they would have part o and ladies too , they will not let me have all fool to myself , they be snatching .
give me an egg , nuncle , and i give thee two crowns .
what two crowns shall they be ?
why , after i have cut the egg i ' the middle , and eat up the meat , the two crowns of the egg .
when thou clovest thy crown i ' the middle , and gavest away both parts , thou borest thy ass on thy back the dirt thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown , when thou gavest thy golden one away .
if i speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so .
singing fools had less wit in a year , for wise men are grown foppish , they know not how their wits to wear , their manners are so apish .
when were you wont to be so full of songs , sirrah ?
i have used it , nuncle , ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers for when thou gavest them the rod , and down thine own breeches , singing then they for sudden joy did weep , and i for sorrow sung , that such a king should play , and go the fools among .
prithee , nuncle , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie i would fain learn to lie .
an you lie , sirrah , we have you whipped .
i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are they have me whipped for speaking true , have me whipped for lying , and sometimes i am whipped for holding my peace .
i had rather be any kind o ' thing than a fool and yet i would not be thee , nuncle , thou hast pared thy wit o ' both sides , and left nothing i ' the middle here comes one o ' the parings .
enter goneril how now , daughter !
what makes that frontlet on ?
methinks you are too much of late i ' the frown .
thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning , now thou art an o without a figure i am better than thou art now , i am a fool , thou art nothing .
to goneril yes , forsooth , i will hold my tongue , so your face bids me , though you say nothing .
mum , mum , he that keeps nor crust nor crum , weary of all , shall want some .
pointing to king lear that a shealed peascod .
not only , sir , this your fool , but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel , breaking forth in rank and endured riots .
sir , i had thought , by making this well known unto you , to have found a safe redress , but now grow fearful , by what yourself too late have spoke and done .
that you protect this course , and put it on by your allowance , which if you should , the fault would not censure , nor the redresses sleep , which , in the tender of a wholesome weal , might in their working do you that offence , which else were shame , that then necessity will call discreet proceeding .
for , you trow , nuncle , the fed the cuckoo so long , that it had it head bit off by it young .
so , out went the candle , and we were left darkling .
are you our daughter ?
come , sir , i would you would make use of that good wisdom , whereof i know you are fraught , and put away these dispositions , that of late transform you from what you rightly are .
may not an ass know when the cart draws the horse ?
whoop , jug !
i love thee .
doth any here know me ?
this is not lear doth lear walk thus ?
speak thus ?
where are his eyes ?
either his notion weakens , his discernings are lethargied ha !
waking ?
is not so .
who is it that can tell me who i am ?
lear shadow .
i would learn that , for , by the marks of sovereignty , knowledge , and reason , i should be false persuaded i had daughters .
which they will make an obedient father .
your name , fair gentlewoman ?
this admiration , sir , is much o ' the savour of other your new pranks .
i do beseech you to understand my purposes aright as you are old and reverend , you should be wise .
here do you keep a hundred knights and squires , men so disorder , so debosh and bold , that this our court , infected with their manners , shows like a riotous inn epicurism and lust make it more like a tavern or a brothel than a graced palace .
the shame itself doth speak for instant remedy be then desired by her , that else will take the thing she begs , a little to disquantity your train , and the remainder , that shall still depend , to be such men as may besort your age , and know themselves and you .
darkness and devils !
saddle my horses , call my train together degenerate bastard !

o lear , lear , lear !
beat at this gate , that let thy folly in , striking his head and thy dear judgment out !
go , go , my people .
my lord , i am guiltless , as i am ignorant of what hath moved you .

hear , nature , hear , dear goddess , hear !
suspend thy purpose , if thou didst intend to make this creature fruitful !
into her womb convey sterility !
dry up in her the organs of increase , and from her derogate body never spring a babe to honour her !
if she must teem , create her child of spleen , that it may live , and be a thwart disnatured torment to her !
let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth , with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks , turn all her mother pains and benefits to laughter and contempt , that she may feel how sharper than a serpent tooth it is to have a thankless child !
away , away !
exit now , gods that we adore , whereof comes this ?
never afflict yourself to know the cause , but let his disposition have that scope that dotage gives it .
king lear what , fifty of my followers at a clap !

what the matter , sir ?
i tell thee to goneril life and death !
i am ashamed that thou hast power to shake my manhood thus , that these hot tears , which break from me perforce , should make thee worth them .
blasts and fogs upon thee !
the untented woundings of a father curse pierce every sense about thee !
old fond eyes , beweep this cause again , i pluck ye out , and cast you , with the waters that you lose , to temper clay .
yea , it is come to this ?
let is be so yet have i left a daughter , who , i am sure , is kind and comfortable when she shall hear this of thee , with her nails she flay thy wolvish visage .
thou shalt find that i resume the shape which thou dost think i have cast off for ever thou shalt , i warrant thee .

a fox , when one has caught her , and such a daughter , should sure to the slaughter , if my cap would buy a halter so the fool follows after .
exit this man hath had good counsel a hundred knights !
is politic and safe to let him keep at point a hundred knights yes , that , on every dream , each buzz , each fancy , each complaint , dislike , he may enguard his dotage with their powers , and hold our lives in mercy .
oswald , i say !
well , you may fear too far .
safer than trust too far let me still take away the harms i fear , not fear still to be taken i know his heart .
what he hath utter i have writ my sister if she sustain him and his hundred knights when i have show the unfitness , oswald how now , oswald !

yes , madam .
take you some company , and away to horse inform her full of my particular fear , and thereto add such reasons of your own as may compact it more .
get you gone , and hasten your return .
exit oswald no , no , my lord , this milky gentleness and course of yours though i condemn not , yet , under pardon , you are much more attask for want of wisdom than praised for harmful mildness .

no .
why , to keep one eyes of either side nose , that what a man can not smell out , he may spy into .
i did her wrong canst tell how an oyster makes his shell ?
no .
nor i neither , but i can tell why a snail has a house .

let him fly far not in this land shall he remain uncaught , and found dispatch .
the noble duke my master , my worthy arch and patron , comes by his authority i will proclaim it , that he which finds him shall deserve our thanks , bringing the murderous coward to the stake , he that conceals him , death .
when i dissuaded him from his intent , and found him pight to do it , with curst speech i threaten to discover him he replied , unpossessing bastard !
dost thou think , if i would stand against thee , would the reposal of any trust , virtue , or worth in thee make thy words faith ?
no what i should deny , as this i would ay , though thou didst produce my very character , turn it all to thy suggestion , plot , and damned practise and thou must make a dullard of the world , if they not thought the profits of my death were very pregnant and potential spurs to make thee seek it .

keep peace , upon your lives he dies that strikes again .
what is the matter ?
the messengers from our sister and the king .
what is your difference ?
speak .
i am scarce in breath , my lord .
no marvel , you have so bestirred your valour .
you cowardly rascal , nature disclaims in thee a tailor made thee .
thou art a strange fellow a tailor make a man ?
ay , a tailor , sir a or painter could not have made him so ill , though he had been but two hours at the trade .
speak yet , how grew your quarrel ?
this ancient ruffian , sir , whose life i have spared at suit of his gray beard , thou whoreson zed !
thou unnecessary letter !
my lord , if you will give me leave , i will tread this unbolted villain into mortar , and daub the wall of a jakes with him .
spare my gray beard , you wagtail ?
peace , sirrah !
you beastly knave , know you no reverence ?
yes , sir , but anger hath a privilege .
why art thou angry ?
that such a slave as this should wear a sword , who wears no honesty .
such smiling rogues as these , like rats , oft bite the holy cords which are too intrinse t ' unloose , smooth every passion that in the natures of their lords rebel , bring oil to fire , snow to their colder moods , renege , affirm , and turn their halcyon beaks with every gale and vary of their masters , knowing nought , like dogs , but following .
a plague upon your epileptic visage !
smile you my speeches , as i were a fool ?
goose , if i had you upon sarum plain , drive ye cackling home to camelot .
why , art thou mad , old fellow ?
how fell you out ?
say that .
no contraries hold more antipathy than i and such a knave .
why dost thou call him a knave ?
what his offence ?
his countenance likes me not .
no more , perchance , does mine , nor his , nor hers .
sir , is my occupation to be plain i have seen better faces in my time than stands on any shoulder that i see before me at this instant .
this is some fellow , who , having been praised for bluntness , doth affect a saucy roughness , and constrains the garb quite from his nature he can not flatter , he , an honest mind and plain , he must speak truth !
an they will take it , so , if not , he plain .
these kind of knaves i know , which in this plainness harbour more craft and more corrupter ends than twenty silly ducking observants that stretch their duties nicely .
sir , in good sooth , in sincere verity , under the allowance of your great aspect , whose influence , like the wreath of radiant fire on flickering phoebus ' front , what by this ?
to go out of my dialect , which you discommend so much .
i know , sir , i am no flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave , which for my part i will not be , though i should win your displeasure to entreat me to .
what was the offence you gave him ?
i never gave him any it pleased the king his master very late to strike at me , upon his misconstruction , when he , conjunct and flattering his displeasure , tripp me behind , being down , insulted , rail , and put upon him such a deal of man , that worthied him , got praises of the king for him attempting who was , and , in the fleshment of this dread exploit , drew on me here again .
none of these rogues and cowards but ajax is their fool .
fetch forth the stocks !
you stubborn ancient knave , you reverend braggart , we teach you sir , i am too old to learn call not your stocks for me i serve the king , on whose employment i was sent to you you shall do small respect , show too bold malice against the grace and person of my master , stocking his messenger .
fetch forth the stocks !
as i have life and honour , there shall he sit till noon .
till noon !
till night , my lord , and all night too .
why , madam , if i were your father dog , you should not use me so .
sir , being his knave , i will .
this is a fellow of the colour our sister speaks of .
come , bring away the stocks !
stocks brought out let me beseech your grace not to do so his fault is much , and the good king his master will cheque him for your purposed low correction is such as basest and wretches for pilferings and most common trespasses are punish with the king must take it ill , that he so slightly valued in his messenger , should have him thus restrain .
i answer that .
my sister may receive it much more worse , to have her gentleman abused , assaulted , for following her affairs .
put in his legs .
kent is put in the stocks come , my good lord , away .
exeunt all but gloucester and kent i am sorry for thee , friend , is the duke pleasure , whose disposition , all the world well knows , will not be rubb nor stopp i entreat for thee .
pray , do not , sir i have watched and travell hard , some time i shall sleep out , the rest i whistle .
a good man fortune may grow out at heels give you good morrow !
the duke to blame in this , be ill taken .
exit good king , that must approve the common saw , thou out of heaven benediction comest to the warm sun !
approach , thou beacon to this under globe , that by thy comfortable beams i may peruse this letter !
nothing almost sees miracles but misery i know is from cordelia , who hath most fortunately been inform of my obscured course , and shall find time from this enormous state , seeking to give losses their remedies .

the country gives me proof and precedent of bedlam beggars , who , with roaring voices , strike in their numb and mortified bare arms pins , wooden pricks , nails , sprigs of rosemary , and with this horrible object , from low farms , poor pelting villages , , and mills , sometime with lunatic bans , sometime with prayers , enforce their charity .

as i learn , the night before there was no purpose in them of this remove .
hail to thee , noble master !
ha !
makest thou this shame thy pastime ?
no , my lord .
ha , ha !
he wears cruel garters .
horses are tied by the heads , dogs and bears by the neck , monkeys by the loins , and men by the legs when a man at legs , then he wears wooden .
what he that hath so much thy place mistook to set thee here ?
it is both he and she , your son and daughter .
no .
yes .
no , i say .
i say , yea .
no , no , they would not .
yes , they have .
by jupiter , i swear , no .
by juno , i swear , ay .
they durst not do , they could not , would not do , is worse than murder , to do upon respect such violent outrage resolve me , with all modest haste , which way thou mightst deserve , or they impose , this usage , coming from us .
my lord , when at their home i did commend your highness ' letters to them , ere i was risen from the place that show my duty kneeling , came there a reeking post , stew in his haste , half breathless , panting forth from goneril his mistress salutations , deliver letters , spite of intermission , which presently they read on whose contents , they summon up their meiny , straight took horse , commanded me to follow , and attend the leisure of their answer , gave me cold looks and meeting here the other messenger , whose welcome , i perceived , had poison mine , being the very fellow that of late display so saucily against your highness , having more man than wit about me , drew he raised the house with loud and coward cries .
your son and daughter found this trespass worth the shame which here it suffers .
winter not gone yet , if the fly that way .
fathers that wear rags do make their children blind , but fathers that bear bags shall see their children kind .
fortune , that arrant whore , turns the key to the poor .
but , for all this , thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year .
o , how this mother swells up toward my heart !
hysterica passio , down , thou climbing sorrow , thy element below !
where is this daughter ?
with the earl , sir , here within .
follow me not , stay here .
exit made you no more offence but what you speak of ?
none .
how chance the king comes with so small a train ?
and thou hadst been set i ' the stocks for that question , thou hadst well deserved it .
why , fool ?
we set thee to school to an ant , to teach thee there no labouring i ' the winter .
all that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men , and there not a nose among twenty but can smell him that stinking .
let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill , lest it break thy neck with following it but the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after .
when a wise man gives thee better counsel , give me mine again i would have none but knaves follow it , since a fool gives it .
that sir which serves and seeks for gain , and follows but for form , will pack when it begins to rain , and leave thee in the storm , but i will tarry , the fool will stay , and let the wise man fly the knave turns fool that runs away , the fool no knave , perdy .
where learned you this , fool ?
not i ' the stocks , fool .
king lear with gloucester deny to speak with me ?
they are sick ?
they are weary ?
they have travell all the night ?
mere fetches , the images of revolt and flying off .
fetch me a better answer .
my dear lord , you know the fiery quality of the duke , how unremoveable and fix he is in his own course .

wherefore looking on kent should he sit here ?
this act persuades me that this remotion of the duke and her is practise only .

i would have all well betwixt you .

was her brother that , in pure kindness to his horse , buttered his hay .
enter cornwall , regan , gloucester , and servants good morrow to you both .
hail to your grace !
kent is set at liberty i am glad to see your highness .
regan , i think you are , i know what reason i have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad , i would divorce me from thy mother tomb , sepulchring an adultress .
to kent o , are you free ?
some other time for that .
beloved regan , thy sister naught o regan , she hath tied unkindness , like a vulture , here points to his heart i can scarce speak to thee , not believe with how depraved a quality o regan !
i pray you , sir , take patience i have hope .
you less know how to value her desert than she to scant her duty .
say , how is that ?
i can not think my sister in the least would fail her obligation if , sir , perchance she have restrain the riots of your followers , is on such ground , and to such wholesome end , as clears her from all blame .
my curses on her !
o , sir , you are old .
nature in you stands on the very verge of her confine you should be ruled and led by some discretion , that discerns your state better than you yourself .
therefore , i pray you , that to our sister you do make return , say you have wrong her , sir .
ask her forgiveness ?
do you but mark how this becomes the house daughter , i confess that i am old , kneeling age is unnecessary on my knees i beg that you vouchsafe me raiment , bed , and food . '
good sir , no more , these are unsightly tricks return you to my sister .
rising never , regan she hath abated me of half my train , look black upon me , struck me with her tongue , most , upon the very heart all the stored vengeances of heaven fall on her ingrateful top !
strike her young bones , you taking airs , with lameness !
fie , sir , fie !
you nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes !
infect her beauty , you fogs , drawn by the powerful sun , to fall and blast her pride !
o the blest gods !
so will you wish on me , when the rash mood is on .
no , regan , thou shalt never have my curse thy nature shall not give thee to harshness her eyes are fierce , but thine do comfort and not burn .
is not in thee to grudge my pleasures , to cut off my train , to bandy hasty words , to scant my sizes , and in conclusion to oppose the bolt against my coming in thou better the offices of nature , bond of childhood , effects of courtesy , dues of gratitude , thy half o ' the kingdom hast thou not forgot , wherein i thee endow .
good sir , to the purpose .
who put my man i ' the stocks ?
tucket within what trumpet that ?
i , my sister this approves her letter , that she would soon be here .
enter oswald is your lady come ?
this is a slave , whose pride dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows .
out , varlet , from my sight !
what means your grace ?
who stock my servant ?
regan , i have good hope thou didst not know o .
who comes here ?
o heavens , enter goneril if you do love old men , if your sweet sway allow obedience , if yourselves are old , make it your cause , send down , and take my part !
to goneril art not ashamed to look upon this beard ?
o regan , wilt thou take her by the hand ?
why not by the hand , sir ?
how have i offended ?
all not offence that indiscretion finds and dotage terms so .
o sides , you are too tough , will you yet hold ?
how came my man i ' the stocks ?
i set him there , sir but his own disorders deserved much less advancement .
you !
did you ?
i pray you , father , being weak , seem so .
if , till the expiration of your month , you will return and sojourn with my sister , dismissing half your train , come then to me i am now from home , and out of that provision which shall be needful for your entertainment .
return to her , and fifty men dismiss ?
no , rather i abjure all roofs , and choose to wage against the enmity o ' the air , to be a comrade with the wolf and owl , necessity sharp pinch !
return with her ?
why , the france , that dowerless took our youngest born , i could as well be brought to knee his throne , and , , pension beg to keep base life afoot .
return with her ?
persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter to this detested groom .
pointing at oswald at your choice , sir .
i prithee , daughter , do not make me mad i will not trouble thee , my child , farewell we no more meet , no more see one another but yet thou art my flesh , my blood , my daughter , or rather a disease that in my flesh , which i must needs call mine thou art a boil , a , an embossed carbuncle , in my corrupted blood .
but i not chide thee , let shame come when it will , i do not call it i do not bid the shoot , nor tell tales of thee to jove mend when thou canst , be better at thy leisure i can be patient , i can stay with regan , i and my hundred knights .
not altogether so i look not for you yet , nor am provided for your fit welcome .
give ear , sir , to my sister , for those that mingle reason with your passion must be content to think you old , and so but she knows what she does .
is this well spoken ?
i dare avouch it , sir what , fifty followers ?
is it not well ?
what should you need of more ?
yea , or so many , sith that both charge and danger speak so great a number ?
how , in one house , should many people , under two commands , hold amity ?
is hard , almost impossible .
why might not you , my lord , receive attendance from those that she calls servants or from mine ?
why not , my lord ?
if then they chanced to slack you , we could control them .
if you will come to me , for now i spy a danger , i entreat you to bring but five and twenty to no more will i give place or notice .
i gave you all and in good time you gave it .
made you my guardians , my depositaries , but kept a reservation to be follow with such a number .
what , must i come to you with five and twenty , regan ?
said you so ?
and again , my lord , no more with me .
those wicked creatures yet do look , when others are more wicked not being the worst stands in some rank of praise .
to goneril i go with thee thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty , and thou art twice her love .
hear me , my lord , what need you five and twenty , ten , or five , to follow in a house where twice so many have a command to tend you ?
what need one ?
o , reason not the need our basest beggars are in the poorest thing superfluous allow not nature more than nature needs , man life as cheap as beast thou art a lady , if only to go warm were gorgeous , why , nature needs not what thou gorgeous , which scarcely keeps thee warm .
but , for true need , you heavens , give me that patience , patience i need !
you see me here , you gods , a poor old man , as full of grief as age , wretched in both !
if it be you that stir these daughters ' hearts against their father , fool me not so much to bear it tamely , touch me with noble anger , and let not women weapons , , stain my man cheeks !
no , you unnatural hags , i will have such revenges on you both , that all the world shall i will do such things , what they are , yet i know not but they shall be the terrors of the earth .
you think i weep no , i not weep i have full cause of weeping , but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , or ere i weep .
o fool , i shall go mad !
exeunt king lear , gloucester , kent , and fool storm and tempest let us withdraw , be a storm .
this house is little the old man and his people can not be well bestow .

for his particular , i receive him gladly , but not one follower .
so am i purposed .
where is my lord of gloucester ?

gloucester the king is in high rage .
whither is he going ?
he calls to horse , but will i know not whither .

alack , the night comes on , and the bleak winds do sorely ruffle , for many miles a bout there scarce a bush .
o , sir , to wilful men , the injuries that they themselves procure must be their schoolmasters .
shut up your doors he is attended with a desperate train , and what they may incense him to , being apt to have his ear abused , wisdom bids fear .

storm still .
enter kent and a gentleman , meeting who there , besides foul weather ?
one minded like the weather , most unquietly .
i know you .
where the king ?
contending with the fretful element bids the winds blow the earth into the sea , or swell the curled water the main , that things might change or cease , tears his white hair , which the impetuous blasts , with eyeless rage , catch in their fury , and make nothing of , strives in his little world of man to the wind and rain .
this night , wherein the bear would couch , the lion and the wolf keep their fur dry , unbonneted he runs , and bids what will take all .
but who is with him ?
none but the fool , who labours to his injuries .
sir , i do know you , and dare , upon the warrant of my note , commend a dear thing to you .
there is division , although as yet the face of it be cover with mutual cunning , albany and cornwall , who have as who have not , that their great stars throned and set high ? servants , who seem no less , which are to france the spies and speculations intelligent of our state , what hath been seen , either in snuffs and packings of the dukes , or the hard rein which both of them have borne against the old kind king , or something deeper , whereof perchance these are but furnishings , but , true it is , from france there comes a power into this scatter kingdom , who already , wise in our negligence , have secret feet in some of our best ports , and are at point to show their open banner .
now to you if on my credit you dare build so far to make your speed to dover , you shall find some that will thank you , making just report of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow the king hath cause to plain .
i am a gentleman of blood and breeding , and , from some knowledge and assurance , offer this office to you .
i will talk further with you .
no , do not .
for confirmation that i am much more than my , open this purse , and take what it contains .
if you shall see cordelia , as fear not but you shall , show her this ring , and she will tell you who your fellow is that yet you do not know .
fie on this storm !
i will go seek the king .
give me your hand have you no more to say ?
few words , but , to effect , more than all yet , that , when we have found the king , in which your pain that way , i this , he that first lights on him holla the other .

alas , sir , are you here ?

let the great gods , that keep this dreadful pother our heads , find out their enemies now .
tremble , thou wretch , that hast within thee undivulged crimes , unwhipp of justice hide thee , thou bloody hand , thou perjured , and thou simular man of virtue that art incestuous caitiff , to pieces shake , that under covert and convenient seeming hast practised on man life close guilts , rive your concealing continents , and cry these dreadful summoners grace .

come , bring us to this hovel .
exeunt king lear and kent this is a brave night to cool a courtezan .
i speak a prophecy ere i go when priests are more in word than matter , when brewers mar their malt with water , when nobles are their tailors ' tutors , no heretics burn , but wenches ' suitors , when every case in law is right , no squire in debt , nor no poor knight , when slanders do not live in tongues , nor cutpurses come not to throngs , when usurers tell their gold i ' the field , and bawds and whores do churches build , then shall the realm of albion come to great confusion then comes the time , who lives to , that going shall be used with feet .
this prophecy merlin shall make , for i live before his time .

o goneril !
you are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face .
i fear your disposition that nature , which contemns its origin , can not be border certain in itself , she that herself will sliver and disbranch from her material sap , perforce must wither and come to deadly use .
no more , the text is foolish .
wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile filths savour but themselves .
what have you done ?
tigers , not daughters , what have you perform ?
a father , and a gracious aged man , whose reverence even the bear would lick , most barbarous , most degenerate !
have you madded .
could my good brother suffer you to do it ?
a man , a prince , by him so benefited !
if that the heavens do not their visible spirits send quickly down to tame these vile offences , it will come , humanity must perforce prey on itself , like monsters of the deep .
man !
that a cheek for blows , a head for wrongs , who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning thine honour from thy suffering , that not fools do those villains pity who are punish ere they have done their mischief .
where thy drum ?
france spreads his banners in our noiseless land , with plumed helm thy slayer begins threats , whiles thou , a moral fool , still , and criest , why does he so ? '
see thyself , devil !
proper deformity seems not in the fiend so horrid as in woman .
o vain fool !
thou changed and thing , for shame , not thy feature .

exeunt scene iii .
the french camp near dover .
enter kent and a gentleman why the king of france is so suddenly gone back know you the reason ?
something he left imperfect in the state , which since his coming forth is thought of , which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger , that his personal return was most required and necessary .
who hath he left behind him general ?
the marshal of france , monsieur la far .
did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ?
ay , sir , she took them , read them in my presence , and now and then an ample tear trill down her delicate cheek it seem she was a queen over her passion , who , most , sought to be king her .
o , then it moved her .
not to a rage patience and sorrow strove who should express her goodliest .
you have seen sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears were like a better way those happy smilets , that play on her ripe lip , seem not to know what guests were in her eyes , which parted thence , as pearls from diamonds dropp .
in brief , sorrow would be a rarity most beloved , if all could so become it .
made she no verbal question ?
, once or twice she heaved the name of ' pantingly forth , as if it press her heart cried !
sisters !
shame of ladies !
sisters !
kent !
father !
sisters !
what , i ' the storm ?
i ' the night ?
let pity not be believed ! '
there she shook the holy water from her heavenly eyes , and clamour moisten then away she started to deal with grief alone .
it is the stars , the stars above us , govern our conditions , else one self mate and mate could not beget such different issues .
you spoke not with her since ?
no .
was this before the king return ?
no , since .
well , sir , the poor distressed lear i ' the town , who sometime , in his better tune , remembers what we are come about , and by no means will yield to see his daughter .
why , good sir ?
a sovereign shame so elbows him his own unkindness , that stripp her from his benediction , turn her to foreign casualties , gave her dear rights to his daughters , these things sting his mind so venomously , that burning shame detains him from cordelia .
alack , poor gentleman !
of albany and cornwall powers you heard not ?
is so , they are afoot .
well , sir , i bring you to our master lear , and leave you to attend him some dear cause will in concealment wrap me up awhile , when i am known aright , you shall not grieve lending me this acquaintance .

madam , with much ado your sister is the better soldier .
lord edmund spake not with your lord at home ?
no , madam .
what might import my sister letter to him ?
i know not , lady .
, he is posted hence on serious matter .
it was great ignorance , gloucester eyes being out , to let him live where he arrives he moves all hearts against us edmund , i think , is gone , in pity of his misery , to dispatch his nighted life moreover , to descry the strength o ' the enemy .
i must needs after him , madam , with my letter .
our troops set forth stay with us , the ways are dangerous .
i may not , madam my lady charged my duty in this business .
why should she write to edmund ?
might not you transport her purposes by word ?
belike , something i know not what i love thee much , let me unseal the letter .
madam , i had rather i know your lady does not love her husband , i am sure of that and at her late being here she gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks to noble edmund .
i know you are of her bosom .
i , madam ?
i speak in understanding , you are , i therefore i do advise you , take this note my lord is dead , edmund and i have talk , and more convenient is he for my hand than for your lady you may gather more .
if you do find him , pray you , give him this , and when your mistress hears thus much from you , i pray , desire her call her wisdom to her .
so , fare you well .
if you do chance to hear of that blind traitor , preferment falls on him that cuts him off .
would i could meet him , madam !
i should show what party i do follow .
fare thee well .
exeunt scene vi .

you do climb up it now look , how we labour .
methinks the ground is even .
horrible steep .
hark , do you hear the sea ?
no , truly .
why , then , your other senses grow imperfect by your eyes ' anguish .
so may it be , indeed methinks thy voice is alter , and thou in better phrase and matter than thou didst .
you much deceived in nothing am i changed but in my garments .
methinks you better spoken .
come on , sir , here the place stand still .
how fearful and dizzy is , to cast one eyes so low !
the crows and choughs that wing the midway air show scarce so gross as beetles half way down hangs one that gathers samphire , dreadful trade !
methinks he seems no bigger than his head the fishermen , that walk upon the beach , appear like mice , and yond tall anchoring bark , diminish to her cock , her cock , a buoy almost too small for sight the murmuring surge , that on the unnumber idle pebbles chafes , can not be heard so high .
i look no more , lest my brain turn , and the deficient sight topple down headlong .
set me where you stand .
give me your hand you are now within a foot of the extreme verge for all beneath the moon would i not leap upright .
let go my hand .
here , friend , another purse , in it a jewel well worth a poor man taking fairies and gods prosper it with thee !
go thou farther off , bid me farewell , and let me hear thee going .
now fare you well , good sir .
with all my heart .
why i do trifle thus with his despair is done to cure it .
kneeling o you mighty gods !
this world i do renounce , and , in your sights , shake patiently my great affliction off if i could bear it longer , and not fall to quarrel with your great opposeless wills , my snuff and loathed part of nature should burn itself out .
if edgar live , o , bless him !
now , fellow , fare thee well .
he falls forward gone , sir farewell .
and yet i know not how conceit may rob the treasury of life , when life itself yields to the theft had he been where he thought , by this , had thought been past .
alive or dead ?
ho , you sir !
friend !
hear you , sir !
speak !
thus might he pass indeed yet he revives .
what are you , sir ?
away , and let me die .
hadst thou been aught but gossamer , feathers , air , so many fathom down precipitating , shiver like an egg but thou dost breathe , hast heavy substance , not , , art sound .
ten masts at each make not the altitude which thou hast perpendicularly fell thy life a miracle .
speak yet again .
but have i , or no ?
from the dread summit of this chalky bourn .
look up , the lark so far can not be seen or heard do but look up .
alack , i have no eyes .
is wretchedness deprived that benefit , to end itself by death ?
was yet some comfort , when misery could beguile the tyrant rage , and frustrate his proud will .
give me your arm up so .
how is ?
feel you your legs ?
you stand .
too well , too well .
this is above all strangeness .
upon the crown o ' the cliff , what thing was that which parted from you ?
a poor unfortunate beggar .
as i stood here below , methought his eyes were two full moons , he had a thousand noses , horns whelk and waved like the enridged sea it was some fiend , therefore , thou happy father , think that the clearest gods , who make them honours of men impossibilities , have preserved thee .
i do remember now henceforth i bear affliction till it do cry out itself , enough , ' and die .
that thing you speak of , i took it for a man , often say fiend , the fiend ' he led me to that place .
bear free and patient thoughts .
but who comes here ?
enter king lear , fantastically dressed with wild flowers the safer sense will accommodate his master thus .

they flattered me like a dog , and told me i had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there .
to say ' and ' to every thing that i said ! ' and ' too was no good divinity .
when the rain came to wet me once , and the wind to make me chatter , when the thunder would not peace at my bidding , there i found , there i smelt out .
go to , they are not men o ' their words they told me i was every thing , is a lie , i am not .
the trick of that voice i do well remember is not the king ?
ay , every inch a king when i do stare , see how the subject quakes .
i pardon that man life .
what was thy cause ?
adultery ?
thou shalt not die die for adultery !

with him i sent the queen , my reason all the same , and they are ready , or at further space , to appear where you shall hold your session .
at this time we sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend , and the best quarrels , in the heat , are cursed by those that feel their sharpness the question of cordelia and her father requires a fitter place .
sir , by your patience , i hold you but a subject of this war , not as a brother .

methinks our pleasure might have been demanded , ere you had spoke so far .

say thou , ' this sword , this arm , and my best spirits , are bent to prove upon thy heart , whereto i speak , thou liest .
in wisdom i should ask thy name , but , since thy outside looks so fair and warlike , and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes , what safe and nicely i might well delay by rule of knighthood , i disdain and spurn back do i toss these treasons to thy head , with the lie thy heart , which , for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise , this sword of mine shall give them instant way , where they shall rest for ever .
trumpets , speak !
alarums .
they fight .
edmund falls save him , save him !

where have you hid yourself ?
how have you known the miseries of your father ?
by nursing them , my lord .
list a brief tale , and when is told , o , that my heart would burst !
the bloody proclamation to escape , that follow me so near , o , our lives ' sweetness !
that we the pain of death would hourly die rather than die at once ! taught me to shift into a madman rags , to assume a semblance that very dogs disdain and in this habit met i my father with his bleeding rings , their precious stones new lost became his guide , led him , begg for him , saved him from despair , never , o fault ! reveal myself unto him , until some past , when i was arm not sure , though hoping , of this good success , i ask his blessing , and from first to last told him my pilgrimage but his flaw heart , alack , too weak the conflict to support !
two extremes of passion , joy and grief , burst smilingly .
this speech of yours hath moved me , and shall perchance do good but speak you on , you look as you had something more to say .
if there be more , more woeful , hold it in , for i am almost ready to dissolve , hearing of this .
this would have seem a period to such as love not sorrow , but another , to amplify too much , would make much more , and top extremity .
whilst i was big in clamour came there in a man , who , having seen me in my worst estate , shunn my abhorr society , but then , finding who was that so endured , with his strong arms he fastened on my neck , and bellow out as burst heaven , threw him on my father , told the most piteous tale of lear and him that ever ear received which in recounting his grief grew puissant and the strings of life began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded , and there i left him tranced .

bear them from hence .
our present business is general woe .
to kent and edgar friends of my soul , you twain rule in this realm , and the gored state sustain .
i have a journey , sir , shortly to go , my master calls me , i must not say no .
the weight of this sad time we must obey , speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
the oldest hath borne most we that are young shall never see so much , nor live so long .
exeunt , with a dead march act i scene i .
the king of navarre park .
enter ferdinand king of navarre , biron , longaville and dumain let fame , that all hunt after in their lives , live register upon our brazen tombs and then grace us in the disgrace of death , when , spite of cormorant devouring time , the endeavor of this present breath may buy that honour which shall bate his scythe keen edge and make us heirs of all eternity .
therefore , brave conquerors , for so you are , that war against your own affections and the huge army of the world desires , our late edict shall strongly stand in force navarre shall be the wonder of the world , our court shall be a little academe , still and contemplative in living art .
you three , biron , dumain , and longaville , have sworn for three years ' term to live with me my , and to keep those statutes that are recorded in this schedule here your oaths are pass , and now subscribe your names , that his own hand may strike his honour down that violates the smallest branch herein if you are arm to do as sworn to do , subscribe to your deep oaths , and keep it too .
i am resolved , is but a three years ' fast the mind shall banquet , though the body pine fat paunches have lean pates , and dainty bits make rich the ribs , but bankrupt quite the wits .
my loving lord , dumain is mortified the grosser manner of these world delights he throws upon the gross world baser slaves to love , to wealth , to pomp , i pine and die , with all these living in philosophy .
i can but say their protestation over , so much , dear liege , i have already sworn , that is , to live and study here three years .
but there are other strict observances , as , not to see a woman in that term , which i hope well is not enrolled there , and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside , the which i hope is not enrolled there , and then , to sleep but three hours in the night , and not be seen to wink of all the day when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day which i hope well is not enrolled there o , these are barren tasks , too hard to keep , not to see ladies , study , fast , not sleep !
your oath is pass to pass away from these .
let me say no , my liege , an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years ' space .
you swore to that , biron , and to the rest .
by yea and nay , sir , then i swore in jest .
what is the end of study ?
let me know .
why , that to know , which else we should not know .
things hid and barr , you mean , from common sense ?
ay , that is study godlike recompense .
come on , then , i will swear to study so , to know the thing i am forbid to know as thus , to study where i well may dine , when i to feast expressly am forbid , or study where to meet some mistress fine , when mistresses from common sense are hid , or , having sworn too hard a keeping oath , study to break it and not break my troth .
if study gain be thus and this be so , study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this , and i will say no .
these be the stops that hinder study quite and train our intellects to vain delight .
why , all delights are vain , but that most vain , which with pain purchased doth inherit pain as , painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth , while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so , ere you find where light in darkness lies , your light grows dark by losing of your eyes .
study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye , who dazzling so , that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by .
study is like the heaven glorious sun that will not be with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others ' books these earthly godfathers of heaven lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are .
too much to know is to know nought but fame , and every godfather can give a name .
how well he read , to reason against reading !
proceeded well , to stop all good proceeding !
he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding .
the spring is near when green geese are .
how follows that ?
fit in his place and time .
in reason nothing .
something then in rhyme .
biron is like an envious sneaping frost , that bites the infants of the spring .
well , say i am , why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing ?
why should i joy in any abortive birth ?
at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in may mirth , but like of each thing that in season grows .
so you , to study now it is too late , climb the house to unlock the little gate .
well , sit you out go home , biron adieu .
no , my good lord , i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say , yet confident i keep what i have swore and bide the penance of each three years ' day .
give me the paper , let me read the same , and to the decrees i write my name .
how well this yielding rescues thee from shame !
reads , that no woman shall come within a mile of my court ' hath this been proclaimed ?
four days ago .
let see the penalty .
reads pain of losing her tongue . '
who devised this penalty ?
marry , that did i .
sweet lord , and why ?
to fright them hence with that dread penalty .
a dangerous law against gentility !
reads , if any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years , he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise . '
this article , my liege , yourself must break , for well you know here comes in embassy the french king daughter with yourself to speak a maid of grace and complete majesty about surrender up of aquitaine to her decrepit , sick and bedrid father therefore this article is made in vain , or vainly comes the admired princess hither .
what say you , lords ?
why , this was quite forgot .
so study evermore is overshot while it doth study to have what it would it doth forget to do the thing it should , and when it hath the thing it hunteth most , is won as towns with fire , so won , so lost .
we must of force dispense with this decree , she must lie here on mere necessity .
necessity will make us all forsworn three thousand times within this three years ' space , for every man with his affects is born , not by might master but by special grace if i break faith , this word shall speak for me , i am forsworn on necessity . '
so to the laws at large i write my name subscribes and he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame suggestions are to other as to me , but i believe , although i seem so loath , i am the last that will last keep his oath .
but is there no quick recreation granted ?
ay , that there is .
our court , you know , is haunted with a refined traveller of spain , a man in all the world new fashion planted , that hath a mint of phrases in his brain , one whom the music of his own vain tongue doth ravish like enchanting harmony , a man of complements , whom right and wrong have chose as umpire of their mutiny this child of fancy , that armado hight , for interim to our studies shall relate in words the worth of many a knight from tawny spain lost in the world debate .
how you delight , my lords , i know not , i , but , i protest , i love to hear him lie and i will use him for my minstrelsy .
armado is a most illustrious wight , a man of words , fashion own knight .
costard the swain and he shall be our sport , and so to study , three years is but short .
enter dull with a letter , and costard which is the duke own person ?
this , fellow what wouldst ?
i myself reprehend his own person , for i am his grace tharborough but i would see his own person in flesh and blood .
this is he .
signior arme arme commends you .
there villany abroad this letter will tell you more .
sir , the contempts thereof are as touching me .
a letter from the magnificent armado .
how low soever the matter , i hope in god for high words .
a high hope for a low heaven god grant us patience !
to hear ?
or forbear laughing ?
to hear meekly , sir , and to laugh moderately , or to forbear both .
well , sir , be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness .
the matter is to me , sir , as concerning jaquenetta .
the manner of it is , i was taken with the manner .
in what manner ?
in manner and form following , sir , all those three i was seen with her in the , sitting with her upon the form , and taken following her into the park , which , put together , is in manner and form following .
now , sir , for the manner , it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form , in some form .
for the following , sir ?
as it shall follow in my correction and god defend the right !
will you hear this letter with attention ?
as we would hear an oracle .
such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh .
reads deputy , the welkin vicegerent and sole dominator of navarre , my soul earth god , and body fostering patron . '
not a word of costard yet .
reads it is , ' it may be so but if he say it is so , he is , in telling true , but so .
peace !
be to me and every man that dares not fight !
no words !
of other men secrets , i beseech you .
reads it is , besieged with melancholy , i did commend the humour to the most wholesome physic of thy air , and , as i am a gentleman , betook myself to walk .
the time when .
about the sixth hour , when beasts most graze , birds best peck , and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper so much for the time when .
now for the ground which , which , i mean , i walked upon it is thy park .
then for the place where , where , i mean , i did encounter that obscene and preposterous event , that draweth from my pen the ink , which here thou viewest , beholdest , surveyest , or seest , but to the place where , it standeth and by east from the west corner of thy knotted garden there did i see that swain , that base minnow of thy mirth , ' me ?
reads unlettered soul , ' me ?
reads shallow vassal , ' still me ?
reads , as i remember , hight costard , ' o , me !
reads and consorted , contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon , which with , o , with but with this i passion to say wherewith , with a wench .
reads a child of our grandmother eve , a female , or , for thy more sweet understanding , a woman .
him i , as my duty pricks me on , have sent to thee , to receive the meed of punishment , by thy sweet grace officer , anthony dull , a man of good repute , carriage , bearing , and estimation . '
, a shall please you , i am anthony dull .
reads jaquenetta , so is the weaker vessel called which i apprehended with the aforesaid swain , i keep her as a vessel of the law fury , and shall , at the least of thy sweet notice , bring her to trial .
thine , in all compliments of devoted and heat of duty .
don adriano de armado . '
this is not so well as i looked for , but the best that ever i heard .
ay , the best for the worst .
but , sirrah , what say you to this ?
sir , i confess the wench .
did you hear the proclamation ?
i do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking of it .
it was proclaimed a year imprisonment , to be taken with a wench .
i was taken with none , sir i was taken with a damsel .
well , it was proclaimed . '
this was no damsel , neither , sir , she was a virgin .
it is so varied , too , for it was proclaimed . '
if it were , i deny her virginity i was taken with a maid .
this maid will not serve your turn , sir .
this maid will serve my turn , sir .
sir , i will pronounce your sentence you shall fast a week with bran and water .
i had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge .
and don armado shall be your keeper .
my lord biron , see him deliver and go we , lords , to put in practise that which each to other hath so strongly sworn .
exeunt ferdinand , longaville , and dumain i lay my head to any good man hat , these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn .
sirrah , come on .
i suffer for the truth , sir , for true it is , i was taken with jaquenetta , and jaquenetta is a true girl , and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity !
affliction may one day smile again , and till then , sit thee down , sorrow !
exeunt love labours lost scene ii .
the same .
enter don adriano de armado and moth don boy , what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy ?
a great sign , sir , that he will look sad .
don why , sadness is one and the thing , dear imp .
no , no , o lord , sir , no .
don how canst thou part sadness and melancholy , my tender juvenal ?
by a familiar demonstration of the working , my tough senior .
don why tough senior ?
why tough senior ?
why tender juvenal ?
why tender juvenal ?
don i spoke it , tender juvenal , as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days , which we may nominate tender .
and i , tough senior , as an appertinent title to your old time , which we may name tough .
don adriano de pretty and apt .
how mean you , sir ?
i pretty , and my saying apt ?
or i apt , and my saying pretty ?
don thou pretty , because little .
little pretty , because little .
wherefore apt ?
don and therefore apt , because quick .
speak you this in my praise , master ?
don in thy condign praise .
i will praise an eel with the same praise .
don what , that an eel is ingenious ?
that an eel is quick .
don i do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood .
i am answered , sir .
don i love not to be crossed .
aside he speaks the mere contrary , crosses love not him .
don i have promised to study three years with the duke .
you may do it in an hour , sir .
don impossible .
how many is one thrice told ?
don i am ill at reckoning , it fitteth the spirit of a tapster .
you are a gentleman and a gamester , sir .
don i confess both they are both the varnish of a complete man .
then , i am sure , you know how much the gross sum of amounts to .
don it doth amount to one more than two .
which the base vulgar do call three .
don true .
why , sir , is this such a piece of study ?
now here is three studied , ere ye thrice wink and how easy it is to put ' to the word , ' and study three years in two words , the dancing horse will tell you .
don a most fine figure !
to prove you a cipher .
don i will hereupon confess i am in love and as it is base for a soldier to love , so am i in love with a base wench .
if drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it , i would take desire prisoner , and ransom him to any french courtier for a courtesy .
i think scorn to sigh methinks i should outswear cupid .
comfort , me , boy what great men have been in love ?
hercules , master .
don most sweet hercules !
more authority , dear boy , name more , and , sweet my child , let them be men of good repute and carriage .
samson , master he was a man of good carriage , great carriage , for he carried the on his back like a porter and he was in love .
don o samson !
samson !
i do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates .
i am in love too .
who was samson love , my dear moth ?
a woman , master .
don of what complexion ?
of all the four , or the three , or the two , or one of the four .
don tell me precisely of what complexion .
of the green , sir .
don is that one of the four complexions ?
as i have read , sir , and the best of them too .
don green indeed is the colour of lovers , but to have a love of that colour , methinks samson had small reason for it .
he surely affected her for her wit .
it was so , sir , for she had a green wit .
don my love is most immaculate white and red .
most maculate thoughts , master , are masked under such colours .
don define , define , infant .
my father wit and my mother tongue , assist me !
don sweet invocation of a child , most pretty and pathetical !
if she be made of white and red , her faults will be known , for blushing cheeks by faults are bred and fears by pale white shown then if she fear , or be to blame , by this you shall not know , for still her cheeks possess the same which native she doth owe .
a dangerous rhyme , master , against the reason of white and red .
don is there not a ballad , boy , of the king and the beggar ?
the world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since but i think now is not to be found , or , if it were , it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune .
don i will have that subject newly writ , that i may example my digression by some mighty precedent .
boy , i do love that country girl that i took in the park with the rational hind costard she deserves well .
aside to be whipped , and yet a better love than my master .
don sing , boy , my spirit grows heavy in love .
and that great marvel , loving a light wench .
don i say , sing .
forbear till this company be past .
enter dull , costard , and jaquenetta sir , the duke pleasure is , that you keep costard safe and you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance , but a ' must fast three days a week .
for this damsel , i must keep her at the park she is allowed for the .
fare you well .
don i do betray myself with blushing .
maid !
man ?
don i will visit thee at the lodge .
that hereby .
don i know where it is situate .
lord , how wise you are !
don i will tell thee wonders .
with that face ?
don i love thee .
so i heard you say .
don and so , farewell .
fair weather after you !
come , jaquenetta , away !
exeunt dull and jaquenetta don villain , thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned .
well , sir , i hope , when i do it , i shall do it on a full stomach .
don thou shalt be heavily punished .
i am more bound to you than your fellows , for they are but lightly rewarded .
don take away this villain , shut him up .
come , you transgressing slave , away !
let me not be pent up , sir i will fast , being loose .
no , sir , that were fast and loose thou shalt to prison .
well , if ever i do see the merry days of desolation that i have seen , some shall see .
what shall some see ?
nay , nothing , master moth , but what they look upon .
it is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words , and therefore i will say nothing i thank god i have as little patience as another man , and therefore i can be quiet .
exeunt moth and costard don i do affect the very ground , which is base , where her shoe , which is baser , guided by her foot , which is basest , doth tread .
i shall be forsworn , which is a great argument of falsehood , if i love .
and how can that be true love which is falsely attempted ?
love is a familiar , love is a devil there is no evil angel but love .
yet was samson so tempted , and he had an excellent strength , yet was solomon so seduced , and he had a very good wit .
cupid is too hard for hercules ' club , and therefore too much odds for a spaniard rapier .
the first and second cause will not serve my turn , the passado he respects not , the duello he regards not his disgrace is to be called boy , but his glory is to subdue men .
adieu , valour !
rust rapier !
be still , drum !
for your manager is in love , yea , he loveth .
assist me , some extemporal god of rhyme , for i am sure i shall turn sonnet .
devise , wit , write , pen , for i am for whole volumes in folio .
exit love labours lost act ii scene i .
the same .
enter the princess of france , rosaline , maria , katharine , boyet , lords , and other attendants now , madam , summon up your dearest spirits consider who the king your father sends , to whom he sends , and what his embassy yourself , held precious in the world esteem , to parley with the sole inheritor of all perfections that a man may owe , matchless navarre , the plea of no less weight than aquitaine , a dowry for a queen .
be now as prodigal of all dear grace as nature was in making graces dear when she did starve the general world beside and prodigally gave them all to you .
good lord boyet , my beauty , though but mean , needs not the painted flourish of your praise beauty is bought by judgement of the eye , not utter by base sale of chapmen tongues i am less proud to hear you tell my worth than you much willing to be counted wise in spending your wit in the praise of mine .
but now to task the tasker good boyet , you are not ignorant , fame doth noise abroad , navarre hath made a vow , till painful study shall outwear three years , no woman may approach his silent court therefore to seemeth it a needful course , before we enter his forbidden gates , to know his pleasure , and in that behalf , bold of your worthiness , we single you as our fair solicitor .
tell him , the daughter of the king of france , on serious business , craving quick dispatch , importunes personal conference with his grace haste , signify so much , while we attend , like suitors , his high will .
proud of employment , willingly i go .
all pride is willing pride , and yours is so .
exit boyet who are the votaries , my loving lords , that are with this virtuous duke ?
lord longaville is one .
know you the man ?
i know him , madam at a , between lord perigort and the beauteous heir of jaques falconbridge , solemnized in normandy , saw i this longaville a man of sovereign parts he is esteem , well fitted in arts , glorious in arms nothing becomes him ill that he would well .
the only soil of his fair virtue gloss , if virtue gloss will stain with any soil , is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will , whose edge hath power to cut , whose will still wills it should none spare that come within his power .
some merry mocking lord , belike , so ?
they say so most that most his humours know .
such wits do wither as they grow .
who are the rest ?
the young dumain , a youth , of all that virtue love for virtue loved most power to do most harm , least knowing ill , for he hath wit to make an ill shape good , and shape to win grace though he had no wit .
i saw him at the duke alencon once , and much too little of that good i saw is my report to his great worthiness .
another of these students at that time was there with him , if i have heard a truth .
biron they call him , but a merrier man , within the limit of becoming mirth , i never spent an hour talk withal his eye begets occasion for his wit , for every object that the one doth catch the other turns to a jest , which his fair tongue , conceit expositor , delivers in such apt and gracious words that aged ears play truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravished , so sweet and voluble is his discourse .
god bless my ladies !
are they all in love , that every one her own hath garnished with such bedecking ornaments of praise ?
here comes boyet .
boyet now , what admittance , lord ?
navarre had notice of your fair approach , and he and his competitors in oath were all address to meet you , gentle lady , before i came .
marry , thus much i have learnt he rather means to lodge you in the field , like one that comes here to besiege his court , than seek a dispensation for his oath , to let you enter his unpeopled house .
here comes navarre .
enter ferdinand , longaville , dumain , biron , and attendants fair princess , welcome to the court of navarre .
' i give you back again , and ' i have not yet the roof of this court is too high to be yours , and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine .
you shall be welcome , madam , to my court .
i will be welcome , then conduct me thither .
hear me , dear lady , i have sworn an oath .
our lady help my lord !
he be forsworn .
not for the world , fair madam , by my will .
why , will shall break it , will and nothing else .
your ladyship is ignorant what it is .
were my lord so , his ignorance were wise , where now his knowledge must prove ignorance .
i hear your grace hath sworn out tis deadly sin to keep that oath , my lord , and sin to break it .
but pardon me .
i am too to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me .
vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming , and suddenly resolve me in my suit .
madam , i will , if suddenly i may .
you will the sooner , that i were away , for you prove perjured if you make me stay .
did not i dance with you in brabant once ?
did not i dance with you in brabant once ?
i know you did .
how needless was it then to ask the question !
you must not be so quick .
is of you that spur me with such questions .
your wit too hot , it speeds too fast , tire .
not till it leave the rider in the mire .
what time o ' day ?
the hour that fools should ask .
now fair befall your mask !
fair fall the face it covers !
and send you many lovers !
amen , so you be none .
nay , then will i be gone .
madam , your father here doth intimate the payment of a hundred thousand crowns , being but the one half of an entire sum disbursed by my father in his wars .
but say that he or we , as neither have , received that sum , yet there remains unpaid a hundred thousand more , in surety of the which , one part of aquitaine is bound to us , although not valued to the money worth .
if then the king your father will restore but that one half which is unsatisfied , we will give up our right in aquitaine , and hold fair friendship with his majesty .
but that , it seems , he little purposeth , for here he doth demand to have repaid a hundred thousand crowns , and not demands , on payment of a hundred thousand crowns , to have his title live in aquitaine , which we much rather had depart withal and have the money by our father lent than aquitaine so gelded as it is .
dear princess , were not his requests so far from reason yielding , your fair self should make a yielding some reason in my breast and go well satisfied to france again .
you do the king my father too much wrong and wrong the reputation of your name , in so unseeming to confess receipt of that which hath so faithfully been paid .
i do protest i never heard of it , and if you prove it , i repay it back or yield up aquitaine .
we arrest your word .
boyet , you can produce acquittances for such a sum from special officers of charles his father .
satisfy me so .
so please your grace , the packet is not come where that and other specialties are bound you shall have a sight of them .
it shall suffice me at which interview all liberal reason i will yield unto .
meantime receive such welcome at my hand as honour without breach of honour may make tender of to thy true worthiness you may not come , fair princess , in my gates , but here without you shall be so received as you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart , though so denied fair harbour in my house .
your own good thoughts excuse me , and farewell shall we visit you again .
sweet health and fair desires consort your grace !
thy own wish wish i thee in every place !
exit lady , i will commend you to mine own heart .
pray you , do my commendations , i would be glad to see it .
i would you heard it groan .
is the fool sick ?
sick at the heart .
alack , let it blood .
would that do it good ?
my physic says . '
will you with your eye ?
no point , with my knife .
now , god save thy life !
and yours from long living !
i can not stay thanksgiving .
retiring sir , i pray you , a word what lady is that same ?
the heir of alencon , katharine her name .
a gallant lady .
monsieur , fare you well .
exit i beseech you a word what is she in the white ?
a woman sometimes , an you saw her in the light .
perchance light in the light .
i desire her name .
she hath but one for herself , to desire that were a shame .
pray you , sir , whose daughter ?
her mother , i have heard .
god blessing on your beard !
good sir , be not offended .
she is an heir of falconbridge .
nay , my choler is ended .
she is a most sweet lady .
not unlike , sir , that may be .
exit longaville what her name in the cap ?
rosaline , by good hap .
is she wedded or no ?
to her will , sir , or so .
you are welcome , sir adieu .
farewell to me , sir , and welcome to you .
exit biron that last is biron , the merry madcap lord not a word with him but a jest .
and every jest but a word .
it was well done of you to take him at his word .
i was as willing to grapple as he was to board .
two hot sheeps , marry .
and wherefore not ships ?
no sheep , sweet lamb , unless we feed on your lips .
you sheep , and i pasture shall that finish the jest ?
so you grant pasture for me .
offering to kiss her not so , gentle beast my lips are no common , though several they be .
belonging to whom ?
to my fortunes and me .
good wits will be jangling , but , gentles , agree this civil war of wits were much better used on navarre and his , for here is abused .
if my observation , which very seldom lies , by the heart still rhetoric disclosed with eyes , deceive me not now , navarre is infected .
with what ?
with that which we lovers entitle affected .
your reason ?
why , all his behaviors did make their retire to the court of his eye , peeping thorough desire his heart , like an agate , with your print impress , proud with his form , in his eye pride express his tongue , all impatient to speak and not see , did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be , all senses to that sense did make their repair , to feel only looking on fairest of fair methought all his senses were lock in his eye , as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy , who , tendering their own worth from where they were glass , did point you to buy them , along as you pass his face own margent did quote such amazes that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes .
i give you aquitaine and all that is his , an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss .
come to our pavilion boyet is disposed .
but to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed .
i only have made a mouth of his eye , by adding a tongue which i know will not lie .
thou art an old and speakest skilfully .
he is cupid grandfather and learns news of him .
then was venus like her mother , for her father is but grim .
do you hear , my mad wenches ?
no .
what then , do you see ?
ay , our way to be gone .
you are too hard for me .

go , tenderness of years , take this key , give enlargement to the swain , bring him festinately hither i must employ him in a letter to my love .
master , will you win your love with a french brawl ?
don how meanest thou ?
brawling in french ?
no , my complete master but to jig off a tune at the tongue end , canary to it with your feet , humour it with turning up your eyelids , sigh a note and sing a note , sometime through the throat , as if you swallowed love with singing love , sometime through the nose , as if you snuffed up love by smelling love , with your hat the shop of your eyes , with your arms crossed on your doublet like a rabbit on a spit , or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting , and keep not too long in one tune , but a snip and away .
these are complements , these are humours , these betray nice wenches , that would be betrayed without these , and make them men of note do you note me ? that most are affected to these .
don how hast thou purchased this experience ?
by my penny of observation .

to sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose let me see , a fat , ay , that a fat goose .
don come hither , come hither .
how did this argument begin ?
by saying that a costard was broken in a shin .

don but tell me , how was there a costard broken in a shin ?
i will tell you sensibly .
thou hast no feeling of it , moth i will speak that i costard , running out , that was safely within , fell over the threshold and broke my shin .

well , lords , we shall have our dispatch on saturday we will return to france .
then , forester , my friend , where is the bush that we must stand and play the murderer in ?
hereby , upon the edge of yonder coppice , a stand where you may make the fairest shoot .
i thank my beauty , i am fair that shoot , and thereupon thou the fairest shoot .
pardon me , madam , for i meant not so .
what , what ?
first praise me and again say no ?
o pride !
not fair ?
alack for woe !
yes , madam , fair .
nay , never paint me now where fair is not , praise can not mend the brow .
here , good my glass , take this for telling true fair payment for foul words is more than due .
nothing but fair is that which you inherit .
see see , my beauty will be saved by merit !
o heresy in fair , fit for these days !
a giving hand , though foul , shall have fair praise .
but come , the bow now mercy goes to kill , and shooting well is then accounted thus will i save my credit in the shoot not wounding , pity would not let me , if wounding , then it was to show my skill , that more for praise than purpose meant to kill .
and out of question so it is sometimes , glory grows guilty of detested crimes , when , for fame sake , for praise , an outward part , we bend to that the working of the heart , as i for praise alone now seek to spill the poor deer blood , that my heart means no do not curst wives hold that only for praise sake , when they strive to be lords their lords ?

here comes a member of the commonwealth .

break the neck of the wax , and every one give ear .
reads heaven , that thou art fair , is most infallible , true , that thou art beauteous , truth itself , that thou art lovely .
more fairer than fair , beautiful than beauteous , truer than truth itself , have commiseration on thy heroical vassal !
the magnanimous and most illustrate king cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar zenelophon , and he it was that might rightly say , veni , vidi , vici , which to annothanize in the vulgar , o base and obscure vulgar ! videlicet , he came , saw , and overcame he came , one , saw two , overcame , three .

thus dost thou hear the nemean lion roar thee , thou lamb , that standest as his prey .
submissive fall his princely feet before , and he from forage will incline to play but if thou strive , poor soul , what art thou then ?
food for his rage , repasture for his den .
what plume of feathers is he that indited this letter ?
what vane ?
what weathercock ?

i am much deceived but i remember the style .
else your memory is bad , going it erewhile .
this armado is a spaniard , that keeps here in court , a phantasime , a monarcho , and one that makes sport to the prince and his bookmates .

i told you , my lord .
to whom shouldst thou give it ?
from my lord to my lady .

and who is your deer ?
if we choose by the horns , yourself come not near .
finely put on , indeed !

but she herself is hit lower have i hit her now ?
shall i come upon thee with an old saying , that was a man when king pepin of france was a little boy , as touching the hit it ?
so i may answer thee with one as old , that was a woman when queen guinover of britain was a little wench , as touching the hit it .
thou canst not hit it , hit it , hit it , thou canst not hit it , my good man .

enter holofernes , sir nathaniel , and dull very reverend sport , truly , and done in the testimony of a good conscience .
the deer was , as you know , sanguis , in blood , ripe as the pomewater , who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo , the sky , the welkin , the heaven , and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra , the soil , the land , the earth .
truly , master holofernes , the epithets are sweetly varied , like a scholar at the least but , sir , i assure ye , it was a buck of the first head .
sir nathaniel , haud credo .
was not a haud credo , was a pricket .
most barbarous intimation !
yet a kind of insinuation , as it were , in via , in way , of explication , facere , as it were , replication , or rather , ostentare , to show , as it were , his inclination , after his undressed , unpolished , uneducated , unpruned , untrained , or rather , unlettered , or ratherest , unconfirmed fashion , to insert again my haud credo for a deer .
i said the deer was not a haud credo , twas a pricket .
simplicity , his coctus !
o thou monster ignorance , how deformed dost thou look !
sir , he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book , he hath not eat paper , as it were , he hath not drunk ink his intellect is not replenished , he is only an animal , only sensible in the duller parts and such barren plants are set before us , that we thankful should be , which we of taste and feeling are , for those parts that do fructify in us more than he .
for as it would ill become me to be vain , indiscreet , or a fool , so were there a patch set on learning , to see him in a school but omne bene , say i , being of an old father mind , many can brook the weather that love not the wind .
you two are can you tell me by your wit what was a month old at cain birth , that not five weeks old as yet ?
dictynna , goodman dull , dictynna , goodman dull .
what is dictynna ?
a title to phoebe , to luna , to the moon .
the moon was a month old when adam was no more , and raught not to five weeks when he came to .
the allusion holds in the exchange .
is true indeed , the collusion holds in the exchange .
god comfort thy capacity !
i say , the allusion holds in the exchange .
and i say , the pollusion holds in the exchange , for the moon is never but a month old and i say beside that , was a pricket that the princess killed .
sir nathaniel , will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer ?
and , to humour the ignorant , call i the deer the princess killed a pricket .
perge , good master holofernes , perge , so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility .
i will something affect the letter , for it argues facility .
the preyful princess pierced and prick a pretty pleasing pricket , some say a sore , but not a sore , till now made sore with shooting .
the dogs did yell put l to sore , then sorel jumps from thicket , or pricket sore , or else sorel , the people fall .
if sore be sore , then l to sore makes fifty sores one sorel .
of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more a rare talent !
aside if a talent be a claw , look how he claws him with a talent .
this is a gift that i have , simple , simple , a foolish extravagant spirit , full of forms , figures , shapes , objects , ideas , apprehensions , motions , revolutions these are begot in the ventricle of memory , nourished in the womb of pia mater , and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion .
but the gift is good in those in whom it is acute , and i am thankful for it .
sir , i praise the lord for you , and so may my parishioners , for their sons are well tutored by you , and their daughters profit very greatly under you you are a good member of the commonwealth .
mehercle , if their sons be ingenuous , they shall want no instruction , if their daughters be capable , i will put it to them but vir sapit qui pauca loquitur , a soul feminine saluteth us .

i will look again on the intellect of the letter , for the nomination of the party writing to the person written unto ladyship in all desired employment , biron . '
sir nathaniel , this biron is one of the votaries with the king , and here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen , which accidentally , or by the way of progression , hath miscarried .

stay not thy compliment , i forgive thy duty , adieu .
good costard , go with me .
sir , god save your life !
have with thee , my girl .
exeunt costard and jaquenetta sir , you have done this in the fear of god , very religiously , and , as a certain father saith , sir tell me not of the father , i do fear colourable colours .
but to return to the verses did they please you , sir nathaniel ?
marvellous well for the pen .
i do dine at the father of a certain pupil of mine , where , if , before repast , it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace , i will , on my privilege i have with the parents of the foresaid child or pupil , undertake your ben venuto , where i will prove those verses to be very unlearned , neither savouring of poetry , wit , nor invention i beseech your society .
and thank you too , for society , saith the text , is the happiness of life .
and , certes , the text most infallibly concludes it .

i will not love if i do , hang me , i ' faith , i will not .
o , but her eye , by this light , but for her eye , i would not love her , yes , for her two eyes .
well , i do nothing in the world but lie , and lie in my throat .
by heaven , i do love and it hath taught me to rhyme and to be melancholy , and here is part of my rhyme , and here my melancholy .
well , she hath one o ' my sonnets already the clown bore it , the fool sent it , and the lady hath it sweet clown , sweeter fool , sweetest lady !

in faith , secrets !
reads so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not to those fresh morning drops upon the rose , as thy , when their fresh rays have smote the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows nor shines the silver moon one half so bright through the transparent bosom of the deep , as doth thy face through tears of mine give light , thou shinest in every tear that i do weep no drop but as a coach doth carry thee , so ridest thou triumphing in my woe .
do but behold the tears that swell in me , and they thy glory through my grief will show but do not love thyself , then thou wilt keep my tears for glasses , and still make me weep .
o queen of queens !
how far dost thou excel , no thought can think , nor tongue of mortal tell .
how shall she know my griefs ?
i drop the paper sweet leaves , shade folly .
who is he comes here ?

why , he comes in like a perjure , wearing papers .
in love , i hope sweet fellowship in shame !
one drunkard loves another of the name .
am i the first that have been perjured so ?
i could put thee in comfort .
not by two that i know thou makest the triumviry , the of society , the shape of love tyburn that hangs up simplicity .
i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move o sweet maria , empress of my love !
these numbers will i tear , and write in prose .
o , rhymes are guards on wanton cupid hose disfigure not his slop .
this same shall go .
reads did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye , whom the world can not hold argument , persuade my heart to this false perjury ?
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment .
a woman i forswore , but i will prove , thou being a goddess , i forswore not thee my vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love , thy grace being gain cures all disgrace in me .
vows are but breath , and breath a vapour is then thou , fair sun , which on my earth dost shine , exhalest this , in thee it is if broken then , it is no fault of mine if by me broke , what fool is not so wise to lose an oath to win a paradise ?
this is the , which makes flesh a deity , a green goose a goddess pure , pure idolatry .
god amend us , god amend !
we are much out o ' the way .
by whom shall i send this ? company !

i would forget her , but a fever she reigns in my blood and will remember be .
a fever in your blood !
why , then incision would let her out in saucers sweet misprision !
once more i read the ode that i have writ .
once more i mark how love can vary wit .
reads on a day alack the day ! love , whose month is ever may , spied a blossom passing fair playing in the wanton air through the velvet leaves the wind , all unseen , can passage find , that the lover , sick to death , wish himself the heaven breath .
air , quoth he , thy cheeks may blow , air , would i might triumph so !
but , alack , my hand is sworn to pluck thee from thy thorn , vow , alack , for youth unmeet , youth so apt to pluck a sweet !
do not call it sin in me , that i am forsworn for thee , thou for whom jove would swear juno but an ethiope were , and deny himself for jove , turning mortal for thy love .
this will i send , and something else more plain , that shall express my true love fasting pain .
o , would the king , biron , and longaville , were lovers too !
ill , to example ill , would from my forehead wipe a perjured note , for none offend where all alike do dote .
advancing dumain , thy love is far from charity .
you may look pale , but i should blush , i know , to be and taken napping so .
advancing come , sir , you blush , as his your case is such , you chide at him , offending twice as much , you do not love maria , longaville did never sonnet for her sake compile , nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart his loving bosom to keep down his heart .
i have been closely shrouded in this bush and mark you both and for you both did blush i heard your guilty rhymes , observed your fashion , saw sighs reek from you , noted well your passion ay me !
says one , o jove !
the other cries , one , her hairs were gold , crystal the other eyes to longaville you would for paradise break faith , and troth , to dumain and jove , for your love , would infringe an oath .
what will biron say when that he shall hear faith so infringed , which such zeal did swear ?
how will he scorn !
how will he spend his wit !
how will he triumph , leap and laugh at it !
for all the wealth that ever i did see , i would not have him know so much by me .
now step i forth to whip hypocrisy .
advancing ah , good my liege , i pray thee , pardon me !
good heart , what grace hast thou , thus to reprove these worms for loving , that art most in love ?
your eyes do make no coaches , in your tears there is no certain princess that appears , you not be perjured , is a hateful thing , tush , none but minstrels like of sonneting !
but are you not ashamed ?
nay , are you not , all three of you , to be thus much ?
you found his mote , the king your mote did see , but i a beam do find in each of three .
o , what a scene of foolery have i seen , of sighs , of groans , of sorrow and of teen !
o me , with what strict patience have i sat , to see a king transformed to a gnat !
to see great hercules whipping a gig , and profound solomon to tune a jig , and nestor play at with the boys , and critic timon laugh at idle toys !
where lies thy grief , o , tell me , good dumain ?
and gentle longaville , where lies thy pain ?
and where my liege ?
all about the breast a caudle , ho !
too bitter is thy jest .
are we betray thus to thy ?
not you to me , but i betray by you i , that am honest , i , that hold it sin to break the vow i am engaged in , i am betray , by keeping company with men like men of inconstancy .
when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme ?
or groan for love ?
or spend a minute time in pruning me ?
when shall you hear that i will praise a hand , a foot , a face , an eye , a gait , a state , a brow , a breast , a waist , a leg , a limb ?
soft !
whither away so fast ?
a true man or a thief that gallops so ?
i post from love good lover , let me go .
enter jaquenetta and costard god bless the king !
what present hast thou there ?
some certain treason .
what makes treason here ?
nay , it makes nothing , sir .
if it mar nothing neither , the treason and you go in peace away together .
i beseech your grace , let this letter be read our parson misdoubts it , was treason , he said .
biron , read it over .
giving him the paper where hadst thou it ?
of costard .
where hadst thou it ?
of dun adramadio , dun adramadio .
biron tears the letter how now !
what is in you ?
why dost thou tear it ?
a toy , my liege , a toy your grace needs not fear it .
it did move him to passion , and therefore let hear it .
it is biron writing , and here is his name .
gathering up the pieces to costard ah , you whoreson loggerhead !
you were born to do me shame .
guilty , my lord , guilty !
i confess , i confess .
what ?
that you three fools lack me fool to make up the mess he , he , and you , and you , my liege , and i , are in love , and we deserve to die .
o , dismiss this audience , and i shall tell you more .
now the number is even .
true , true , we are four .
will these turtles be gone ?
hence , sirs , away !
walk aside the true folk , and let the traitors stay .
exeunt costard and jaquenetta sweet lords , sweet lovers , o , let us embrace !
as true we are as flesh and blood can be the sea will ebb and flow , heaven show his face , young blood doth not obey an old decree we can not cross the cause why we were born , therefore of all hands must we be forsworn .
what , did these rent lines show some love of thine ?
did they , quoth you ?
who sees the heavenly rosaline , that , like a rude and savage man of inde , at the first opening of the gorgeous east , bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast ?
what peremptory eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow , that is not blinded by her majesty ?
what zeal , what fury hath inspired thee now ?
my love , her mistress , is a gracious moon , she an attending star , scarce seen a light .
my eyes are then no eyes , nor i biron o , but for my love , day would turn to night !
of all complexions the cull sovereignty do meet , as at a fair , in her fair cheek , where several worthies make one dignity , where nothing wants that want itself doth seek .
lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues , fie , painted rhetoric !
o , she needs it not to things of sale a seller praise belongs , she passes praise , then praise too short doth blot .
a wither hermit , winters worn , might shake off fifty , looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age , as if , and gives the crutch the cradle infancy o , is the sun that maketh all things shine .
by heaven , thy love is black as ebony .
is ebony like her ?
o wood divine !
a wife of such wood were felicity .
o , who can give an oath ?
where is a book ?
that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack , if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black .
o paradox !
black is the badge of hell , the hue of dungeons and the suit of night , and beauty crest becomes the heavens well .
devils soonest tempt , resembling spirits of light .
o , if in black my lady brows be deck , it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect , and therefore is she born to make black fair .
her favour turns the fashion of the days , for native blood is counted painting now , and therefore red , that would avoid dispraise , paints itself black , to imitate her brow .
to look like her are black .
and since her time are colliers counted bright .
and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack .
dark needs no candles now , for dark is light .
your mistresses dare never come in rain , for fear their colours should be wash away .
good , yours did , for , sir , to tell you plain , i find a fairer face not wash .
i prove her fair , or talk till doomsday here .
no devil will fright thee then so much as she .
i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear .
look , here thy love my foot and her face see .
o , if the streets were paved with thine eyes , her feet were much too dainty for such tread !
o , vile !
then , as she goes , what upward lies the street should see as she walk overhead .
but what of this ?
are we not all in love ?
nothing so sure , and thereby all forsworn .
then leave this chat , and , good biron , now prove our loving lawful , and our faith not torn .
ay , marry , there , some flattery for this evil .
o , some authority how to proceed , some tricks , some quillets , how to cheat the devil .
some salve for perjury .
is more than need .
have at you , then , affection men at arms .
consider what you first did swear unto , to fast , to study , and to see no woman , flat treason the kingly state of youth .
say , can you fast ?
your stomachs are too young , and abstinence engenders maladies .
and where that you have vow to study , lords , in that each of you have forsworn his book , can you still dream and pore and thereon look ?
for when would you , my lord , or you , or you , have found the ground of study excellence without the beauty of a woman face ?
from women eyes this doctrine i derive , they are the ground , the books , the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire why , universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries , as motion and action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller .
now , for not looking on a woman face , you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too , the causer of your vow , for where is any author in the world teaches such beauty as a woman eye ?
learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies ' eyes , do we not likewise see our learning there ?
o , we have made a vow to study , lords , and in that vow we have forsworn our books .
for when would you , my liege , or you , or you , in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty tutors have enrich you with ?
other slow arts entirely keep the brain , and therefore , finding barren practisers , scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love , first learned in a lady eyes , lives not alone immured in the brain , but , with the motion of all elements , courses as swift as thought in every power , and gives to every power a double power , above their functions and their offices .
it adds a precious seeing to the eye , a lover eyes will gaze an eagle blind , a lover ear will hear the lowest sound , when the suspicious head of theft is stopp love feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockl snails , love tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour , is not love a hercules , still climbing trees in the hesperides ?
subtle as sphinx , as sweet and musical as bright apollo lute , strung with his hair and when love speaks , the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony .
never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temper with love sighs , o , then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility .
from women eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire , they are the books , the arts , the academes , that show , contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought proves excellent .
then fools you were these women to forswear , or keeping what is sworn , you will prove fools .
for wisdom sake , a word that all men love , or for love sake , a word that loves all men , or for men sake , the authors of these women , or women sake , by whom we men are men , let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves , or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths .
it is religion to be thus forsworn , for charity itself fulfills the law , and who can sever love from charity ?
saint cupid , then !
and , soldiers , to the field !
advance your standards , and upon them , lords , , down with them !
but be first advised , in conflict that you get the sun of them .
now to , lay these glozes by shall we resolve to woo these girls of france ?
and win them too therefore let us devise some entertainment for them in their tents .
first , from the park let us conduct them thither , then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress in the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them , such as the shortness of the time can shape , for revels , dances , masks and merry hours forerun fair love , strewing her way with flowers .
away , away !
no time shall be omitted that will betime , and may by us be fitted .
allons !
allons !
sow cockle reap no corn , and justice always whirls in equal measure light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn , if so , our copper buys no better treasure .

enter holofernes , sir nathaniel , and dull satis quod sufficit .
i praise god for you , sir your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious , pleasant without scurrility , witty without affection , audacious without impudency , learned without opinion , and strange out heresy .
i did converse this quondam day with a companion of the king , who is intituled , nated , or called , don adriano de armado .
novi hominem tanquam te his humour is lofty , his discourse peremptory , his tongue filed , his eye ambitious , his gait majestical , and his general behavior vain , ridiculous , and thrasonical .
he is too picked , too spruce , too affected , too odd , as it were , too peregrinate , as i may call it .
a most singular and choice epithet .
draws out his he draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument .
i abhor such fanatical phantasimes , such insociable and companions , such rackers of orthography , as to speak dout , fine , when he should say doubt , det , when he should pronounce debt , d , e , b , t , not d , e , t he clepeth a calf , cauf , half , hauf , neighbour vocatur nebor , neigh abbreviated ne .
this is abhominable , which he would call abbominable it insinuateth me of insanie anne intelligis , domine ?

aside to costard they have been at a great feast of languages , and stolen the scraps .
o , they have lived long on the of words .
i marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word , for thou art not so long by the head as honorificabilitudinitatibus thou art easier swallowed than a .
peace !
the peal begins .
don to holofernes monsieur , are you not lettered ?
yes , yes , he teaches boys the hornbook .
what is a , b , spelt backward , with the horn on his head ?

what is the figure ?
horns .
thou disputest like an infant go , whip thy gig .
lend me your horn to make one , and i will whip about your infamy circum circa , a gig of a cuckold horn .
an i had but one penny in the world , thou shouldst have it to buy gingerbread hold , there is the very remuneration i had of thy master , thou halfpenny purse of wit , thou of discretion .
o , an the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my bastard , what a joyful father wouldst thou make me !
go to , thou hast it ad dunghill , at the fingers ' ends , as they say .
o , i smell false latin , dunghill for unguem .
don , preambulate , we will be singled from the barbarous .
do you not educate youth at the on the top of the mountain ?
or mons , the hill .
don at your sweet pleasure , for the mountain .
i do , sans question .
don sir , it is the king most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day , which the rude multitude call the afternoon .
the posterior of the day , most generous sir , is liable , congruent and measurable for the afternoon the word is well culled , chose , sweet and apt , i do assure you , sir , i do assure .
don sir , the king is a noble gentleman , and my familiar , i do assure ye , very good friend for what is inward between us , let it pass .
i do beseech thee , remember thy courtesy , i beseech thee , apparel thy head and among other important and most serious designs , and of great import indeed , too , but let that pass for i must tell thee , it will please his grace , by the world , sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder , and with his royal finger , thus , dally with my excrement , with my mustachio , but , sweet heart , let that pass .
by the world , i recount no fable some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart to armado , a soldier , a man of travel , that hath seen the world , but let that pass .
the very all of all is , but , sweet heart , i do implore secrecy , that the king would have me present the princess , sweet chuck , with some delightful ostentation , or show , or pageant , or antique , or firework .
now , understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth , as it were , i have acquainted you withal , to the end to crave your assistance .
sir , you shall present before her the nine worthies .
sir , as concerning some entertainment of time , some show in the posterior of this day , to be rendered by our assistants , at the king command , and this most gallant , illustrate , and learned gentleman , before the princess , i say none so fit as to present the nine worthies .
where will you find men worthy enough to present them ?
joshua , yourself , myself and this gallant gentleman , judas maccabaeus , this swain , because of his great limb or joint , shall pass pompey the great , the page , hercules , don pardon , sir , error he is not quantity enough for that worthy thumb he is not so big as the end of his club .
shall i have audience ?
he shall present hercules in minority his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake , and i will have an apology for that purpose .
an excellent device !
so , if any of the audience hiss , you may cry done , hercules !
now thou crushest the snake ! '
that is the way to make an offence gracious , though few have the grace to do it .
don for the rest of the worthies ? i will play three myself .
gentleman !
don shall i tell you a thing ?
we attend .
don we will have , if this fadge not , an antique .
i beseech you , follow .
via , goodman dull !
thou hast spoken no word all this while .
nor understood none neither , sir .
allons !
we will employ thee .
i make one in a dance , or so , or i will play on the tabour to the worthies , and let them dance the hay .
most dull , honest dull !
to our sport , away !
exeunt love labours lost scene ii .
the same .
enter the princess , katharine , rosaline , and maria sweet hearts , we shall be rich ere we depart , if fairings come thus plentifully in a lady wall about with diamonds !
look you what i have from the loving king .
madame , came nothing else along with that ?
nothing but this !
yes , as much love in rhyme as would be cramm up in a sheet of paper , writ o ' both sides the leaf , margent and all , that he was fain to seal on cupid name .
that was the way to make his godhead wax , for he hath been five thousand years a boy .
ay , and a shrewd unhappy gallows too .
you be friends with him , a ' kill your sister .
he made her melancholy , sad , and heavy , and so she died had she been light , like you , of such a merry , nimble , stirring spirit , she might ha ' been a grandam ere she died and so may you , for a light heart lives long .
what your dark meaning , mouse , of this light word ?
a light condition in a beauty dark .
we need more light to find your meaning out .
you mar the light by taking it in snuff , therefore i darkly end the argument .
look what you do , you do it still i ' the dark .
so do not you , for you are a light wench .
indeed i weigh not you , and therefore light .
you weigh me not ?
o , that you care not for me .
great reason , for cure is still past care . '
well bandied both , a set of wit well play .
but rosaline , you have a favour too who sent it ?
and what is it ?
i would you knew an if my face were but as fair as yours , my favour were as great , be witness this .
nay , i have verses too , i thank biron the numbers true , and , were the numbering too , i were the fairest goddess on the ground i am compared to twenty thousand fairs .
o , he hath drawn my picture in his letter !
any thing like ?
much in the letters , nothing in the praise .
beauteous as ink , a good conclusion .
fair as a text b in a .
pencils , ho !
let me not die your debtor , my red dominical , my golden letter o , that your face were not so full of o !
a pox of that jest !
and i beshrew all shrows .
but , katharine , what was sent to you from fair dumain ?
madam , this glove .
did he not send you twain ?
yes , madam , and moreover some thousand verses of a faithful lover , a huge translation of hypocrisy , vilely compiled , profound simplicity .
this and these pearls to me sent longaville the letter is too long by half a mile .
i think no less .
dost thou not wish in heart the chain were longer and the letter short ?
ay , or i would these hands might never part .
we are wise girls to mock our lovers so .
they are worse fools to purchase mocking so .
that same biron i torture ere i go o that i knew he were but in by the week !
how i would make him fawn and beg and seek and wait the season and observe the times and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes and shape his service wholly to my hests and make him proud to make me proud that jests !
so would i his state that he should be my fool and i his fate .
none are so surely caught , when they are catch , as wit turn fool folly , in wisdom hatch , hath wisdom warrant and the help of school and wit own grace to grace a learned fool .
the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity revolt to wantonness .
folly in fools bears not so strong a note as foolery in the wise , when wit doth dote , since all the power thereof it doth apply to prove , by wit , worth in simplicity .
here comes boyet , and mirth is in his face .
enter boyet o , i am stabb with laughter !
where her grace ?
thy news boyet ?
prepare , madam , prepare !
arm , wenches , arm !
encounters mounted are against your peace love doth approach disguised , armed in arguments , you be surprised muster your wits , stand in your own defence , or hide your heads like cowards , and fly hence .
saint denis to saint cupid !
what are they that charge their breath against us ?
say , scout , say .
under the cool shade of a sycamore i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour , when , lo !
to interrupt my purposed rest , toward that shade i might behold addrest the king and his companions warily i stole into a neighbour thicket by , and overheard what you shall overhear , that , by and by , disguised they will be here .
their herald is a pretty knavish page , that well by heart hath conn his embassage action and accent did they teach him there , must thou speak , ' and thy body bear ' and ever and anon they made a doubt presence majestical would put him out , , ' quoth the king , angel shalt thou see , yet fear not thou , but speak audaciously . '
the boy replied , angel is not evil , i should have fear her had she been a devil . '
with that , all laugh and clapp him on the shoulder , making the bold wag by their praises bolder one rubb his elbow thus , and fleer and swore a better speech was never spoke before , another , with his finger and his thumb , cried , !
we will , come what will come , ' the third he caper , and cried , goes well , ' the fourth turn on the toe , and down he fell .
with that , they all did tumble on the ground , with such a zealous laughter , so profound , that in this spleen ridiculous appears , to cheque their folly , passion solemn tears .
but what , but what , come they to visit us ?
they do , they do and are apparell thus .
like muscovites or russians , as i guess .
their purpose is to parle , to court and dance , and every one his will advance unto his several mistress , which they know by favours several which they did bestow .
and will they so ?
the gallants shall be task , for , ladies , we shall every one be mask , and not a man of them shall have the grace , despite of suit , to see a lady face .
hold , rosaline , this favour thou shalt wear , and then the king will court thee for his dear , hold , take thou this , my sweet , and give me thine , so shall biron take me for rosaline .
and change your favours too , so shall your loves woo contrary , deceived by these removes .
come on , then , wear the favours most in sight .
but in this changing what is your intent ?
the effect of my intent is to cross theirs they do it but in mocking merriment , and mock for mock is only my intent .
their several counsels they unbosom shall to loves mistook , and so be mock withal upon the next occasion that we meet , with visages displayed , to talk and greet .
but shall we dance , if they desire ?
no , to the death , we will not move a foot , nor to their penn speech render we no grace , but while is spoke each turn away her face .
why , that contempt will kill the speaker heart , and quite divorce his memory from his part .
therefore i do it , and i make no doubt the rest will come in , if he be out there no such sport as sport by sport , to make theirs ours and ours none but our own so shall we stay , mocking intended game , and they , well mock , depart away with shame .
trumpets sound within the trumpet sounds be mask , the maskers come .
the ladies mask enter blackamoors with music , moth , ferdinand , biron , longaville , and dumain , in russian habits , and masked all hail , the richest beauties on the earth ! beauties no richer than rich taffeta .
a holy parcel of the fairest dames .
the ladies turn their backs to him that ever turn their backs to mortal views !
aside to moth their eyes , villain , their eyes !
that ever turn their eyes to mortal views ! out true , out indeed .
out of your favours , heavenly spirits , vouchsafe not to behold aside to moth once to behold , rogue .
once to behold with your eyes , with your eyes they will not answer to that epithet , you were best call it eyes . '
they do not mark me , and that brings me out .
is this your perfectness ?
be gone , you rogue !
exit moth what would these strangers ?
know their minds , boyet if they do speak our language , is our will that some plain man recount their purposes know what they would .
what would you with the princess ?
nothing but peace and gentle visitation .
what would they , say they ?
nothing but peace and gentle visitation .
why , that they have , and bid them so be gone .
she says , you have it , and you may be gone .
say to her , we have measured many miles to tread a measure with her on this grass .
they say , that they have measured many a mile to tread a measure with you on this grass .
it is not so .
ask them how many inches is in one mile if they have measured many , the measure then of one is easily told .
if to come hither you have measured miles , and many miles , the princess bids you tell how many inches doth fill up one mile .
tell her , we measure them by weary steps .
she hears herself .
how many weary steps , of many weary miles you have , are number in the travel of one mile ?
we number nothing that we spend for you our duty is so rich , so infinite , that we may do it still without accompt .
vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face , that we , like savages , may worship it .
my face is but a moon , and clouded too .
blessed are clouds , to do as such clouds do !
vouchsafe , bright moon , and these thy stars , to shine , those clouds removed , upon our watery eyne .
o vain petitioner !
beg a greater matter , thou now but moonshine in the water .
then , in our measure do but vouchsafe one change .
thou me beg this begging is not strange .
play , music , then !
nay , you must do it soon .
music plays not yet !
no dance !
thus change i like the moon .
will you not dance ?
how come you thus estranged ?
you took the moon at full , but now she changed .
yet still she is the moon , and i the man .
the music plays , vouchsafe some motion to it .
our ears vouchsafe it .
but your legs should do it .
since you are strangers and come here by chance , we not be nice take hands .
we will not dance .
why take we hands , then ?
only to part friends curtsy , sweet hearts , and so the measure ends .
more measure of this measure , be not nice .
we can afford no more at such a price .
prize you yourselves what buys your company ?
your absence only .
that can never be .
then can not we be bought and so , adieu , twice to your visor , and half once to you .
if you deny to dance , let hold more chat .
in private , then .
i am best pleased with that .
they converse apart mistress , one sweet word with thee .
honey , and milk , and sugar , there is three .
nay then , two treys , and if you grow so nice , metheglin , wort , and malmsey well run , dice !
there sweets .
seventh sweet , adieu since you can cog , i play no more with you .
one word in secret .
let it not be sweet .
thou grievest my gall .
gall !
bitter .
therefore meet .
they converse apart will you vouchsafe with me to change a word ?
name it .
fair lady , say you so ?
fair lord , take that for your fair lady .
please it you , as much in private , and i bid adieu .
they converse apart what , was your vizard made without a tongue ?
i know the reason , lady , why you ask .
o for your reason !
quickly , sir , i long .
you have a double tongue within your mask , and would afford my speechless vizard half .
veal , quoth the dutchman .
is not ' a calf ?
a calf , fair lady !
no , a fair lord calf .
let part the word .
no , i not be your half take all , and wean it , it may prove an ox .
look , how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks !
will you give horns , chaste lady ?
do not so .
then die a calf , before your horns do grow .
one word in private with you , ere i die .
bleat softly then , the butcher hears you cry .
they converse apart the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen as is the razor edge invisible , cutting a smaller hair than may be seen , above the sense of sense , so sensible seemeth their conference , their conceits have wings fleeter than arrows , bullets , wind , thought , swifter things .
not one word more , my maids , break off , break off .
by heaven , all with pure scoff !
farewell , mad wenches , you have simple wits .
twenty adieus , my frozen muscovits .
exeunt ferdinand , lords , and blackamoors are these the breed of wits so wonder at ?
tapers they are , with your sweet breaths puff out .
wits they have , gross , gross , fat , fat .
o poverty in wit , flout !
will they not , think you , hang themselves tonight ?
or ever , but in vizards , show their faces ?
this pert biron was out of countenance quite .
o , they were all in lamentable cases !
the king was for a good word .
biron did swear himself out of all suit .
dumain was at my service , and his sword no point , quoth i , my servant straight was mute .
lord longaville said , i came his heart , and trow you what he called me ?
qualm , perhaps .
yes , in good faith .
go , sickness as thou art !
well , better wits have worn plain .
but will you hear ?
the king is my love sworn .
and quick biron hath plighted faith to me .
and longaville was for my service born .
dumain is mine , as sure as bark on tree .
madam , and pretty mistresses , give ear immediately they will again be here in their own shapes , for it can never be they will digest this harsh indignity .
will they return ?
they will , they will , god knows , and leap for joy , though they are lame with blows therefore change favours , and , when they repair , blow like sweet roses in this summer air .
how blow ?
how blow ?
speak to be understood .
fair ladies mask are roses in their bud , dismask , their damask sweet commixture shown , are angels vailing clouds , or roses blown .
avaunt , perplexity !
what shall we do , if they return in their own shapes to woo ?
good madam , if by me you be advised , let , mock them still , as well known as disguised let us complain to them what fools were here , disguised like muscovites , in shapeless gear , and wonder what they were and to what end their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn and their rough carriage so ridiculous , should be presented at our tent to us .
ladies , withdraw the gallants are at hand .
whip to our tents , as roes run land .
exeunt princess , rosaline , katharine , and maria ferdinand , biron , longaville , and dumain , in their proper habits fair sir , god save you !
where the princess ?
gone to her tent .
please it your majesty command me any service to her thither ?
that she vouchsafe me audience for one word .
i will , and so will she , i know , my lord .
exit this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease , and utters it again when god doth please he is wit pedler , and retails his wares at wakes and wassails , meetings , markets , fairs , and we that sell by gross , the lord doth know , have not the grace to grace it with such show .
this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve , had he been adam , he had tempted eve , a ' can carve too , and lisp why , this is he that kiss his hand away in courtesy , this is the ape of form , monsieur the nice , that , when he plays at tables , chides the dice in honourable terms nay , he can sing a mean most meanly , and in ushering mend him who can the ladies call him sweet , the stairs , as he treads on them , kiss his feet this is the flower that smiles on every one , to show his teeth as white as whale bone , and consciences , that will not die in debt , pay him the due of boyet .
a blister on his sweet tongue , with my heart , that put armado page out of his part !
see where it comes !
behavior , what wert thou till this madman show thee ?
and what art thou now ?
the princess , ushered by boyet , rosaline , maria , and katharine all hail , sweet madam , and fair time of day !
' in hail ' is foul , as i conceive .
construe my speeches better , if you may .
then wish me better , i will give you leave .
we came to visit you , and purpose now to lead you to our court , vouchsafe it then .
this field shall hold me , and so hold your vow nor god , nor i , delights in perjured men .
rebuke me not for that which you provoke the virtue of your eye must break my oath .
you nickname virtue , vice you should have spoke , for virtue office never breaks men troth .
now by my maiden honour , yet as pure as the unsullied lily , i protest , a world of torments though i should endure , i would not yield to be your house guest , so much i hate a breaking cause to be of heavenly oaths , vow with integrity .
o , you have lived in desolation here , unseen , unvisited , much to our shame .
not so , my lord , it is not so , i swear , we have had pastimes here and pleasant game a mess of russians left us but of late .
how , madam !
russians !
ay , in truth , my lord , trim gallants , full of courtship and of state .
madam , speak true .
it is not so , my lord my lady , to the manner of the days , in courtesy gives undeserving praise .
we four indeed confronted were with four in russian habit here they stay an hour , and talk apace , and in that hour , my lord , they did not bless us with one happy word .
i dare not call them fools , but this i think , when they are thirsty , fools would fain have drink .
this jest is dry to me .
fair gentle sweet , your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet , with eyes best seeing , heaven fiery eye , by light we lose light your capacity is of that nature that to your huge store wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor .
this proves you wise and rich , for in my eye , i am a fool , and full of poverty .
but that you take what doth to you belong , it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue .
o , i am yours , and all that i possess !
all the fool mine ?
i can not give you less .
which of the vizards was it that you wore ?
where ?
when ?
what vizard ?
why demand you this ?
there , then , that vizard , that superfluous case that hid the worse and show the better face .
we are descried , they mock us now downright .
let us confess and turn it to a jest .
amazed , my lord ?
why looks your highness sad ?
help , hold his brows !
he swoon !
why look you pale ?
, i think , coming from muscovy .
thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury .
can any face of brass hold longer out ?
lady , dart thy skill at me , bruise me with scorn , confound me with a flout , thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance , cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit , and i will wish thee never more to dance , nor never more in russian habit wait .
o , never will i trust to speeches penn , nor to the motion of a schoolboy tongue , nor never come in vizard to my friend , nor woo in rhyme , like a blind harper song !
taffeta phrases , silken terms precise , hyperboles , spruce affectation , figures pedantical , these have blown me full of maggot ostentation i do forswear them , and i here protest , by this white glove , how white the hand , god knows ! henceforth my wooing mind shall be express in russet yeas and honest kersey noes and , to begin , wench , so god help me , la ! my love to thee is sound , sans crack or flaw .
sans sans , i pray you .
yet i have a trick of the old rage bear with me , i am sick , i leave it by degrees .
soft , let us see write , have mercy on us ' on those three , they are infected , in their hearts it lies , they have the plague , and caught it of your eyes , these lords are visited , you are not free , for the lord tokens on you do i see .
no , they are free that gave these tokens to us .
our states are forfeit seek not to undo us .
it is not so , for how can this be true , that you stand forfeit , being those that sue ?
peace !
for i will not have to do with you .
nor shall not , if i do as i intend .
speak for yourselves , my wit is at an end .
teach us , sweet madam , for our rude transgression some fair excuse .
the fairest is confession .
were not you here but even now disguised ?
madam , i was .
and were you well advised ?
i was , fair madam .
when you then were here , what did you whisper in your lady ear ?
that more than all the world i did respect her .
when she shall challenge this , you will reject her .
upon mine honour , no .
peace , peace !
forbear your oath once broke , you force not to forswear .
despise me , when i break this oath of mine .
i will and therefore keep it .
rosaline , what did the russian whisper in your ear ?
madam , he swore that he did hold me dear as precious eyesight , and did value me above this world , adding thereto moreover that he would wed me , or else die my lover .
god give thee joy of him !
the noble lord most honourably doth unhold his word .
what mean you , madam ?
by my life , my troth , i never swore this lady such an oath .
by heaven , you did , and to confirm it plain , you gave me this but take it , sir , again .
my faith and this the princess i did give i knew her by this jewel on her sleeve .
pardon me , sir , this jewel did she wear , and lord biron , i thank him , is my dear .
what , will you have me , or your pearl again ?
neither of either , i remit both twain .
i see the trick o here was a consent , knowing aforehand of our merriment , to dash it like a christmas comedy some , some , some slight zany , some , some , some dick , that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick to make my lady laugh when she disposed , told our intents before , which once disclosed , the ladies did change favours and then we , following the signs , woo but the sign of she .
now , to our perjury to add more terror , we are again forsworn , in will and error .
much upon this it is and might not you to boyet forestall our sport , to make us thus untrue ?

enter mercade god save you , madam !
welcome , mercade , but that thou our merriment .
i am sorry , madam , for the news i bring is heavy in my tongue .
the king your father dead , for my life !
even so , my tale is told .
worthies , away !
the scene begins to cloud .
don for mine own part , i breathe free breath .
i have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion , and i will right myself like a soldier .
exeunt worthies how fares your majesty ?
boyet , prepare , i will away tonight .
madam , not so , i do beseech you , stay .
prepare , i say .
i thank you , gracious lords , for all your fair endeavors , and entreat , out of a soul , that you vouchsafe in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide the liberal opposition of our spirits , if we have borne ourselves in the converse of breath your gentleness was guilty of it .
farewell worthy lord !
a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue excuse me so , coming too short of thanks for my great suit so easily obtain .
the extreme parts of time extremely forms all causes to the purpose of his speed , and often at his very loose decides that which long process could not arbitrate and though the mourning brow of progeny forbid the smiling courtesy of love the holy suit which fain it would convince , yet , since love argument was first on foot , let not the cloud of sorrow justle it from what it purposed , since , to wail friends lost is not by much so as to rejoice at friends but newly found .
i understand you not my griefs are double .
honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief , and by these badges understand the king .
for your fair sakes have we neglected time , play foul play with our oaths your beauty , ladies , hath much deform us , fashioning our humours even to the opposed end of our intents and what in us hath seem ridiculous , as love is full of unbefitting strains , all wanton as a child , skipping and vain , form by the eye and therefore , like the eye , full of strange shapes , of habits and of forms , varying in subjects as the eye doth roll to every varied object in his glance which presence of loose love put on by us , if , in your heavenly eyes , have misbecomed our oaths and gravities , those heavenly eyes , that look into these faults , suggested us to make .
therefore , ladies , our love being yours , the error that love makes is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false , by being once false for ever to be true to those that make us both , fair ladies , you and even that falsehood , in itself a sin , thus purifies itself and turns to grace .
we have received your letters full of love , your favours , the ambassadors of love , and , in our maiden council , rated them at courtship , pleasant jest and courtesy , as bombast and as lining to the time but more devout than this in our respects have we not been , and therefore met your loves in their own fashion , like a merriment .
our letters , madam , show much more than jest .
so did our looks .
we did not quote them so .
now , at the latest minute of the hour , grant us your loves .
a time , methinks , too short to make a bargain in .
no , no , my lord , your grace is perjured much , full of dear guiltiness , and therefore this if for my love , as there is no such cause , you will do aught , this shall you do for me your oath i will not trust , but go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage , remote from all the pleasures of the world , there stay until the twelve celestial signs have brought about the annual reckoning .
if this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood , if frosts and fasts , hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love , but that it bear this trial and last love , then , at the expiration of the year , come challenge me , challenge me by these deserts , and , by this virgin palm now kissing thine i will be thine , and till that instant shut my woeful self up in a mourning house , raining the tears of lamentation for the remembrance of my father death .
if this thou do deny , let our hands part , neither entitled in the other heart .
if this , or more than this , i would deny , to flatter up these powers of mine with rest , the sudden hand of death close up mine eye !
hence ever then my heart is in thy breast .
but what to me , my love ?
but what to me ?
a wife ?
a beard , fair health , and honesty , with love i wish you all these three .
o , shall i say , i thank you , gentle wife ?
not so , my lord , a twelvemonth and a day i mark no words that wooers say come when the king doth to my lady come , then , if i have much love , i give you some .
i serve thee true and faithfully till then .
yet swear not , lest ye be forsworn again .
what says maria ?
at the twelvemonth end i change my black gown for a faithful friend .
i stay with patience , but the time is long .
the liker you , few taller are so young .
studies my lady ?
mistress , look on me , behold the window of my heart , mine eye , what humble suit attends thy answer there impose some service on me for thy love .
oft have i heard of you , my lord biron , before i saw you , and the world large tongue proclaims you for a man replete with mocks , full of comparisons and wounding flouts , which you on all estates will execute that lie within the mercy of your wit .
to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain , and therewithal to win me , if you please , without the which i am not to be won , you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick and still converse with groaning wretches , and your task shall be , with all the fierce endeavor of your wit to enforce the pained impotent to smile .
to move wild laughter in the throat of death ?
it can not be , it is impossible mirth can not move a soul in agony .
why , that the way to choke a gibing spirit , whose influence is begot of that loose grace which shallow laughing hearers give to fools a jest prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it , never in the tongue of him that makes it then , if sickly ears , deaf with the clamours of their own dear groans , will hear your idle scorns , continue then , and i will have you and that fault withal , but if they will not , throw away that spirit , and i shall find you empty of that fault , right joyful of your reformation .
a twelvemonth !
well , befall what will befall , i jest a twelvemonth in an hospital .
to ferdinand ay , sweet my lord , and so i take my leave .
no , madam , we will bring you on your way .
our wooing doth not end like an old play , jack hath not jill these ladies ' courtesy might well have made our sport a comedy .
come , sir , it wants a twelvemonth and a day , and then end .
that too long for a play .
don adriano de armado don sweet majesty , vouchsafe me , was not that hector ?
the worthy knight of troy .
don i will kiss thy royal finger , and take leave .
i am a votary , i have vowed to jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three years .
but , most esteemed greatness , will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo ?
it should have followed in the end of our show .
call them forth quickly , we will do so .
don holla !
approach .
holofernes , sir nathaniel , moth , costard , and others this side is hiems , winter , this ver , the spring , the one maintained by the owl , the other by the cuckoo .
ver , begin .
the song spring .
when daisies pied and violets blue and all and of yellow hue do paint the meadows with delight , the cuckoo then , on every tree , mocks married men , for thus sings he , cuckoo , cuckoo , cuckoo o word of fear , unpleasing to a married ear !
when shepherds pipe on oaten straws and merry larks are ploughmen clocks , when turtles tread , and rooks , and daws , and maidens bleach their summer smocks the cuckoo then , on every tree , mocks married men , for thus sings he , cuckoo , cuckoo , cuckoo o word of fear , unpleasing to a married ear !
winter .
when icicles hang by the wall and dick the shepherd blows his nail and tom bears logs into the hall and milk comes frozen home in pail , when blood is nipp and ways be foul , then nightly sings the staring owl , , , a merry note , while greasy joan doth keel the pot .
when all aloud the wind doth blow and coughing drowns the parson saw and birds sit brooding in the snow and marian nose looks red and raw , when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl , then nightly sings the staring owl , , , a merry note , while greasy joan doth keel the pot .
don the words of mercury are harsh after the songs of apollo .

a camp near forres .
alarum within .
enter duncan , malcolm , donalbain , lennox , with attendants , meeting a bleeding sergeant what bloody man is that ?
he can report , as seemeth by his plight , of the revolt the newest state .
this is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought my captivity .
hail , brave friend !
say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it .
doubtful it stood , as two spent swimmers , that do cling together and choke their art .
the merciless macdonwald worthy to be a rebel , for to that the multiplying villanies of nature do swarm upon him from the western isles of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied , and fortune , on his damned quarrel smiling , show like a rebel whore but all too weak for brave macbeth well he deserves that name disdaining fortune , with his brandish steel , which smoked with bloody execution , like valour minion carved out his passage till he faced the slave , which shook hands , nor bade farewell to him , till he unseam him from the nave to the chaps , and fix his head upon our battlements .
o valiant cousin !
worthy gentleman !
as whence the sun his reflection shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break , so from that spring whence comfort seem to come discomfort swells .
mark , king of scotland , mark no sooner justice had with valour arm compell these skipping kerns to trust their heels , but the norweyan lord surveying vantage , with furbish arms and new supplies of men began a fresh assault .
dismay not this our captains , macbeth and banquo ?
yes , as sparrows eagles , or the hare the lion .
if i say sooth , i must report they were as cannons overcharged with double cracks , so they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds , or memorise another golgotha , i can not tell .
but i am faint , my gashes cry for help .
so well thy words become thee as thy wounds , they smack of honour both .
go get him surgeons .
exit sergeant , attended who comes here ?
enter ross the worthy thane of ross .
what a haste looks through his eyes !
so should he look that seems to speak things strange .
god save the king !
whence camest thou , worthy thane ?
from fife , great king , where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold .
norway himself , with terrible numbers , assisted by that most disloyal traitor the thane of cawdor , began a dismal conflict , till that bellona bridegroom , lapp in proof , confronted him with , point against point rebellious , arm arm .
curbing his lavish spirit and , to conclude , the victory fell on us .
great happiness !
that now sweno , the norways ' king , craves composition nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed at saint colme inch ten thousand dollars to our general use .
no more that thane of cawdor shall deceive our bosom interest go pronounce his present death , and with his former title greet macbeth .
i see it done .
what he hath lost noble macbeth hath won .

enter the three witches where hast thou been , sister ?
killing swine .
sister , where thou ?
a sailor wife had chestnuts in her lap , and munch , and munch , and munch me , ' quoth i thee , witch ! '
the ronyon cries .
her husband to aleppo gone , master o ' the tiger but in a sieve i thither sail , and , like a rat without a tail , i do , i do , and i do .
i give thee a wind .
kind .
and i another .
i myself have all the other , and the very ports they blow , all the quarters that they know i ' the shipman card .
i will drain him dry as hay sleep shall neither night nor day hang upon his lid , he shall live a man forbid weary nine times nine shall he dwindle , peak and pine though his bark can not be lost , yet it shall be .
look what i have .
show me , show me .
here i have a pilot thumb , wreck as homeward he did come .
drum within a drum , a drum !
macbeth doth come .
the weird sisters , hand in hand , posters of the sea and land , thus do go about , about thrice to thine and thrice to mine and thrice again , to make up nine .
peace !
the charm wound up .
enter macbeth and banquo so foul and fair a day i have not seen .
how far call to forres ?
what are these so wither and so wild in their attire , that look not like the inhabitants o ' the earth , and yet are o ?
live you ?
or are you aught that man may question ?
you seem to understand me , by each at once her chappy finger laying upon her skinny lips you should be women , and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so .
speak , if you can what are you ?
all hail , macbeth !
hail to thee , thane of glamis !
all hail , macbeth , hail to thee , thane of cawdor !
all hail , macbeth , thou shalt be king hereafter !
good sir , why do you start , and seem to fear things that do sound so fair ?
i ' the name of truth , are ye fantastical , or that indeed which outwardly ye show ?
my noble partner you greet with present grace and great prediction of noble having and of royal hope , that he seems rapt withal to me you speak not .
if you can look into the seeds of time , and say which grain will grow and which will not , speak then to me , who neither beg nor fear your favours nor your hate .
hail !
hail !
hail !
lesser than macbeth , and greater .
not so happy , yet much happier .
thou shalt get kings , though thou be none so all hail , macbeth and banquo !
banquo and macbeth , all hail !
stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more by sinel death i know i am thane of glamis , but how of cawdor ?
the thane of cawdor lives , a prosperous gentleman , and to be king stands not within the prospect of belief , no more than to be cawdor .
say from whence you owe this strange intelligence ?
or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting ?
speak , i charge you .
witches vanish the earth hath bubbles , as the water has , and these are of them .
whither are they vanish ?
into the air , and what seem corporal melted as breath into the wind .
would they had stay !
were such things here as we do speak about ?
or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner ?
your children shall be kings .
you shall be king .
and thane of cawdor too went it not so ?
to the selfsame tune and words .
who here ?
enter ross and angus the king hath happily received , macbeth , the news of thy success , and when he reads thy personal venture in the rebels ' fight , his wonders and his praises do contend which should be thine or his silenced with that , in viewing the rest o ' the selfsame day , he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks , nothing afeard of what thyself didst make , strange images of death .
as thick as hail came post with post , and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdom great defence , and pour them down before him .
we are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks , only to herald thee into his sight , not pay thee .
and , for an earnest of a greater honour , he bade me , from him , call thee thane of cawdor in which addition , hail , most worthy thane !
for it is thine .
what , can the devil speak true ?
the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me in borrow robes ?
who was the thane lives yet , but under heavy judgment bears that life which he deserves to lose .
whether he was combined with those of norway , or did line the rebel with hidden help and vantage , or that with both he labour in his country wreck , i know not , but treasons capital , confess and proved , have overthrown him .
aside glamis , and thane of cawdor !
the greatest is behind .
to ross and angus thanks for your pains .
to banquo do you not hope your children shall be kings , when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me promised no less to them ?
that trusted home might yet enkindle you unto the crown , besides the thane of cawdor .
but is strange and oftentimes , to win us to our harm , the instruments of darkness tell us truths , win us with honest trifles , to betray in deepest consequence .
cousins , a word , i pray you .
aside two truths are told , as happy prologues to the swelling act of the imperial i thank you , gentlemen .
aside can not be ill , can not be good if ill , why hath it given me earnest of success , commencing in a truth ?
i am thane of cawdor if good , why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs , against the use of nature ?
present fears are less than horrible imaginings my thought , whose murder yet is but fantastical , shakes so my single state of man that function is smother in surmise , and nothing is but what is not .
look , how our partner rapt .
aside if chance will have me king , why , chance may crown me , without my stir .
new horrors come upon him , like our strange garments , cleave not to their mould but with the aid of use .
aside come what come may , time and the hour runs through the roughest day .
worthy macbeth , we stay upon your leisure .
give me your favour my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten .
kind gentlemen , your pains are register where every day i turn the leaf to read them .
let us toward the king .
think upon what hath chanced , and , at more time , the interim having weigh it , let us speak our free hearts each to other .
very gladly .
till then , enough .

are not those in commission yet return ?
my liege , they are not yet come back .
but i have spoke with one that saw him die who did report that very frankly he confess his treasons , implored your highness ' pardon and set forth a deep repentance nothing in his life became him like the leaving it , he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed , as a careless trifle .
there no art to find the mind construction in the face he was a gentleman on whom i built an absolute trust .
enter macbeth , banquo , ross , and angus o worthiest cousin !
the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me thou art so far before that swiftest wing of recompense is slow to overtake thee .
would thou hadst less deserved , that the proportion both of thanks and payment might have been mine !
only i have left to say , more is thy due than more than all can pay .
the service and the loyalty i owe , in doing it , pays itself .
your highness ' part is to receive our duties , and our duties are to your throne and state children and servants , which do but what they should , by doing every thing safe toward your love and honour .
welcome hither i have begun to plant thee , and will labour to make thee full of growing .
noble banquo , that hast no less deserved , nor must be known no less to have done so , let me enfold thee and hold thee to my heart .
there if i grow , the harvest is your own .
my plenteous joys , wanton in fulness , seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow .
sons , kinsmen , thanes , and you whose places are the nearest , know we will establish our estate upon our eldest , malcolm , whom we name hereafter the prince of cumberland , which honour must not unaccompanied invest him only , but signs of nobleness , like stars , shall shine on all deservers .
from hence to inverness , and bind us further to you .
the rest is labour , which is not used for you i be myself the harbinger and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach , so humbly take my leave .
my worthy cawdor !
aside the prince of cumberland !
that is a step on which i must fall down , or else , for in my way it lies .
stars , hide your fires , let not light see my black and deep desires the eye wink at the hand , yet let that be , which the eye fears , when it is done , to see .
exit true , worthy banquo , he is full so valiant , and in his commendations i am fed , it is a banquet to me .
let after him , whose care is gone before to bid us welcome it is a peerless kinsman .

when i burned in desire to question them further , they made themselves air , into which they vanished .
whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it , came missives from the king , who me of cawdor , ' by which title , before , these weird sisters saluted me , and referred me to the coming on of time , with , king that shalt be ! '
this have i thought good to deliver thee , my dearest partner of greatness , that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing , by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee .
lay it to thy heart , and farewell . '
glamis thou art , and cawdor , and shalt be what thou art promised yet do i fear thy nature , it is too full o ' the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great , art not without ambition , but without the illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly , that wouldst thou holily , wouldst not play false , and yet wouldst wrongly win have , great glamis , that which cries thou must do , if thou have it , and that which rather thou dost fear to do than wishest should be undone . '
hie thee hither , that i may pour my spirits in thine ear , and chastise with the valour of my tongue all that impedes thee from the golden round , which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem to have thee crown withal .
enter a messenger what is your tidings ?
the king comes here .
mad to say it is not thy master with him ?
who , so , would have inform for preparation .
so please you , it is true our thane is coming one of my fellows had the speed of him , who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more than would make up his message .
give him tending , he brings great news .
exit messenger the raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of duncan under my battlements .
come , you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts , unsex me here , and fill me from the crown to the toe of direst cruelty !
make thick my blood , stop up the access and passage to remorse , that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose , nor keep peace between the effect and it !
come to my woman breasts , and take my milk for gall , you murdering ministers , wherever in your sightless substances you wait on nature mischief !
come , thick night , and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell , that my keen knife see not the wound it makes , nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark , to cry , hold ! '
enter macbeth great glamis !
worthy cawdor !
greater than both , by the hereafter !
thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present , and i feel now the future in the instant .
my dearest love , duncan comes here .
and when goes hence ?
, as he purposes .
o , never shall sun that morrow see !
your face , my thane , is as a book where men may read strange matters .
to beguile the time , look like the time , bear welcome in your eye , your hand , your tongue look like the innocent flower , but be the serpent .
he that coming must be provided for and you shall put this night great business into my dispatch , which shall to all our nights and days to come give solely sovereign sway and masterdom .
we will speak further .
only look up clear , to alter favour ever is to fear leave all the rest to me .

before macbeth castle .
hautboys and torches .
enter duncan , malcolm , donalbain , banquo , lennox , macduff , ross , angus , and attendants this castle hath a pleasant seat , the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses .
this guest of summer , the martlet , does approve , by his loved mansionry , that the heaven breath smells wooingly here no jutty , frieze , buttress , nor coign of vantage , but this bird hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle where they most breed and haunt , i have observed , the air is delicate .
enter lady macbeth see , see , our honour hostess !
the love that follows us sometime is our trouble , which still we thank as love .
herein i teach you how you shall bid god us for your pains , and thank us for your trouble .
all our service in every point twice done and then done double were poor and single business to contend against those honours deep and broad wherewith your majesty loads our house for those of old , and the late dignities heap up to them , we rest your hermits .
where the thane of cawdor ?
we coursed him at the heels , and had a purpose to be his purveyor but he rides well , and his great love , sharp as his spur , hath holp him to his home before us .
fair and noble hostess , we are your guest .
your servants ever have theirs , themselves and what is theirs , in compt , to make their audit at your highness ' pleasure , still to return your own .
give me your hand , conduct me to mine host we love him highly , and shall continue our graces towards him .
by your leave , hostess .
exeunt scene vii .
macbeth castle .
hautboys and torches .
enter a sewer , and divers servants with dishes and service , and pass over the stage .
then enter macbeth if it were done when is done , then well it were done quickly if the assassination could trammel up the consequence , and catch with his surcease success , that but this blow might be the and the here , but here , upon this bank and shoal of time , jump the life to come .
but in these cases we still have judgment here , that we but teach bloody instructions , which , being taught , return to plague the inventor this justice commends the ingredients of our poison chalice to our own lips .
he here in double trust , first , as i am his kinsman and his subject , strong both against the deed , then , as his host , who should against his murderer shut the door , not bear the knife myself .
besides , this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek , hath been so clear in his great office , that his virtues will plead like angels , , against the deep damnation of his , and pity , like a naked babe , striding the blast , or heaven cherubim , horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air , shall blow the horrid deed in every eye , that tears shall drown the wind .
i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent , but only vaulting ambition , which itself and falls on the other .
enter lady macbeth how now !
what news ?
he has almost supp why have you left the chamber ?
hath he ask for me ?
know you not he has ?
we will proceed no further in this business he hath honour me of late , and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people , which would be worn now in their newest gloss , not cast aside so soon .
was the hope drunk wherein you dress yourself ?
hath it slept since ?
and wakes it now , to look so green and pale at what it did so freely ?
from this time such i account thy love .
art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valour as thou art in desire ?
wouldst thou have that which thou the ornament of life , and live a coward in thine own esteem , letting ' i dare not ' wait upon ' i would , ' like the poor cat i ' the adage ?
prithee , peace i dare do all that may become a man , who dares do more is none .
what beast , then , that made you break this enterprise to me ?
when you durst do it , then you were a man , and , to be more than what you were , you would be so much more the man .
nor time nor place did then adhere , and yet you would make both they have made themselves , and that their fitness now does unmake you .
i have given suck , and know how tender is to love the babe that milks me i would , while it was smiling in my face , have pluck my nipple from his boneless gums , and dash the brains out , had i so sworn as you have done to this .
if we should fail ?
we fail !
but screw your courage to the , and we not fail .
when duncan is asleep whereto the rather shall his day hard journey soundly invite him his two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince that memory , the warder of the brain , shall be a fume , and the receipt of reason a limbeck only when in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death , what can not you and i perform upon the unguarded duncan ?
what not put upon his spongy officers , who shall bear the guilt of our great quell ?
bring forth only , for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males .
will it not be received , when we have mark with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers , that they have ?
who dares receive it other , as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar upon his death ?
i am settled , and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat .
away , and mock the time with fairest show false face must hide what the false heart doth know .
exeunt act ii scene i .
court of macbeth castle .
enter banquo , and fleance bearing a torch before him how goes the night , boy ?
the moon is down , i have not heard the clock .
and she goes down at twelve .
i , is later , sir .
hold , take my sword .
there husbandry in heaven , their candles are all out .
take thee that too .
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me , and yet i would not sleep merciful powers , restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose !
enter macbeth , and a servant with a torch give me my sword .
who there ?
a friend .
what , sir , not yet at rest ?
the king he hath been in unusual pleasure , and sent forth great largess to your offices .
this diamond he greets your wife withal , by the name of most kind hostess , and shut up in measureless content .
being unprepared , our will became the servant to defect , which else should free have wrought .
all well .
i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters to you they have show some truth .
i think not of them yet , when we can entreat an hour to serve , we would spend it in some words upon that business , if you would grant the time .
at your leisure .
if you shall cleave to my consent , when is , it shall make honour for you .
so i lose none in seeking to augment it , but still keep my bosom franchised and allegiance clear , i shall be counsell .
good repose the while !
thanks , sir the like to you !
exeunt banquo and fleance go bid thy mistress , when my drink is ready , she strike upon the bell .
get thee to bed .
exit servant is this a dagger which i see before me , the handle toward my hand ?
come , let me clutch thee .
i have thee not , and yet i see thee still .
art thou not , fatal vision , sensible to feeling as to sight ?
or art thou but a dagger of the mind , a false creation , proceeding from the brain ?
i see thee yet , in form as palpable as this which now i draw .
thou me the way that i was going , and such an instrument i was to use .
mine eyes are made the fools o ' the other senses , or else worth all the rest , i see thee still , and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood , which was not so before .
there no such thing it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes .
now the one halfworld nature seems dead , and wicked dreams abuse the curtain sleep , witchcraft celebrates pale hecate offerings , and wither murder , alarum by his sentinel , the wolf , whose howl his watch , thus with his stealthy pace .
with tarquin ravishing strides , towards his design moves like a ghost .
thou sure and earth , hear not my steps , which way they walk , for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout , and take the present horror from the time , which now suits with it .
whiles i threat , he lives words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives .
a bell rings i go , and it is done , the bell invites me .
hear it not , duncan , for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell .

hark !
peace !
it was the owl that shriek , the fatal bellman , which gives the .
he is about it the doors are open , and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores i have drugg their possets , that death and nature do contend about them , whether they live or die .
within who there ?
what , ho !
alack , i am afraid they have awaked , and is not done .
the attempt and not the deed confounds us .
hark !
i laid their daggers ready , he could not miss .
had he not resembled my father as he slept , i had .
enter macbeth my husband !
i have done the deed .
didst thou not hear a noise ?
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
did not you speak ?
when ?
now .
as i descended ?
ay .
hark !
who lies i ' the second chamber ?
donalbain .
this is a sorry sight .
looking on his hands a foolish thought , to say a sorry sight .
there one did laugh in sleep , and one cried ! '
that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers , and address them again to sleep .
there are two lodged together .
one cried bless us ! '
and ' the other , as they had seen me with these hangman hands .
listening their fear , i could not say , ' when they did say bless us ! '
consider it not so deeply .
but wherefore could not i pronounce ' ?
i had most need of blessing , and ' stuck in my throat .
these deeds must not be thought after these ways , so , it will make us mad .
methought i heard a voice cry no more !
macbeth does murder sleep ' , the innocent sleep , sleep that knits up the ravell sleeve of care , the death of each day life , sore labour bath , balm of hurt minds , great nature second course , chief nourisher in life feast , what do you mean ?
still it cried no more ! '
to all the house hath murder sleep , and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more , macbeth shall sleep no more . '
who was it that thus cried ?
why , worthy thane , you do unbend your noble strength , to think so brainsickly of things .
go get some water , and wash this filthy witness from your hand .
why did you bring these daggers from the place ?
they must lie there go carry them , and smear the sleepy grooms with blood .
i go no more i am afraid to think what i have done , look o again i dare not .
infirm of purpose !
give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead are but as pictures is the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil .
if he do bleed , i gild the faces of the grooms withal , for it must seem their guilt .

how with me , when every noise appals me ?
what hands are here ?
ha !
they pluck out mine eyes .
will all great neptune ocean wash this blood clean from my hand ?
no , this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas in incarnadine , making the green one red .

opens the gate enter macduff and lennox was it so late , friend , ere you went to bed , that you do lie so late ?
sir , we were carousing till the second cock and drink , sir , is a great provoker of three things .
what three things does drink especially provoke ?
marry , sir , , sleep , and urine .
lechery , sir , it provokes , and unprovokes , it provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance therefore , much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it makes him , and it mars him , it sets him on , and it takes him off , it persuades him , and disheartens him , makes him stand to , and not stand to , in conclusion , equivocates him in a sleep , and , giving him the lie , leaves him .
i believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
that it did , sir , i ' the very throat on me but i requited him for his lie , and , i think , being too strong for him , though he took up my legs sometime , yet i made a shift to cast him .
is thy master stirring ?
enter macbeth our knocking has awaked him , here he comes .
good morrow , noble sir .
good morrow , both .
is the king stirring , worthy thane ?
not yet .
he did command me to call timely on him i have almost slipp the hour .

this is the door .
i make so bold to call , for is my limited service .
exit goes the king hence ?
he does he did appoint so .
the night has been unruly where we lay , our chimneys were blown down , and , as they say , lamentings heard i ' the air , strange screams of death , and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confused events new hatch to the woeful time the obscure bird clamour the livelong night some say , the earth was feverous and did shake .
was a rough night .
my young remembrance can not parallel a fellow to it .
macduff o horror , horror , horror !
tongue nor heart can not conceive nor name thee !
what the matter .
confusion now hath made his masterpiece !
most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope the lord anointed temple , and stole thence the life o ' the building !

enter banquo o banquo , banquo , our royal master murder !
woe , alas !
what , in our house ?
too cruel any where .
dear duff , i prithee , contradict thyself , and say it is not so .
macbeth and lennox , with ross had i but died an hour before this chance , i had lived a blessed time , for , from this instant , there nothing serious in mortality all is but toys renown and grace is dead , the wine of life is drawn , and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of .
enter malcolm and donalbain what is amiss ?
you are , and do not the spring , the head , the fountain of your blood is stopp , the very source of it is stopp .
your royal father murder .
o , by whom ?
those of his chamber , as it seem , had done their hands and faces were an badged with blood , so were their daggers , which unwiped we found upon their pillows they stared , and were distracted , no man life was to be trusted with them .
o , yet i do repent me of my fury , that i did kill them .
wherefore did you so ?
who can be wise , amazed , temperate and furious , loyal and neutral , in a moment ?
no man the expedition my violent love outrun the pauser , reason .
here lay duncan , his silver skin laced with his golden blood , and his gash stabs look like a breach in nature for ruin wasteful entrance there , the murderers , steep in the colours of their trade , their daggers unmannerly breech with gore who could refrain , that had a heart to love , and in that heart courage to make love kno wn ?
help me hence , ho !
look to the lady .
aside to donalbain why do we hold our tongues , that most may claim this argument for ours ?
aside to malcolm what should be spoken here , where our fate , hid in an , may rush , and seize us ?
let away , our tears are not yet brew .
aside to donalbain nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion .
look to the lady lady macbeth is carried out and when we have our naked frailties hid , that suffer in exposure , let us meet , and question this most bloody piece of work , to know it further .
fears and scruples shake us in the great hand of god i stand , and thence against the undivulged pretence i fight of treasonous malice .
and so do i .
so all .
let briefly put on manly readiness , and meet i ' the hall together .
well contented .
exeunt all but malcolm and donalbain .
what will you do ?
let not consort with them to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy .
i to england .
to ireland , i , our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer where we are , there daggers in men smiles the near in blood , the nearer bloody .
this murderous shaft that shot hath not yet lighted , and our safest way is to avoid the aim .
therefore , to horse , and let us not be dainty of , but shift away there warrant in that theft which steals itself , when there no mercy left .
exeunt scene iv .

enter ross and an old man threescore and ten i can remember well within the volume of which time i have seen hours dreadful and things strange , but this sore night hath trifled former knowings .
ah , good father , thou seest , the heavens , as troubled with man act , threaten his bloody stage by the clock , is day , and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp night predominance , or the day shame , that darkness does the face of earth entomb , when living light should kiss it ?
is unnatural , even like the deed that done .
on tuesday last , a falcon , towering in her pride of place , was by a mousing owl hawk at and kill .
and duncan horses a thing most strange and certain beauteous and swift , the minions of their race , turn wild in nature , broke their stalls , flung out , contending obedience , as they would make war with mankind .
is said they eat each other .
they did so , to the amazement of mine eyes that look upo .
here comes the good macduff .
enter macduff how goes the world , sir , now ?
why , see you not ?
known who did this more than bloody deed ?
those that macbeth hath slain .
alas , the day !
what good could they pretend ?
they were suborn malcolm and donalbain , the king two sons , are away and fled , which puts upon them suspicion of the deed .
nature still !
thriftless ambition , that wilt ravin up thine own life means !
then is most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth .
he is already named , and gone to scone to be invested .
where is duncan body ?
carried to colmekill , the sacred storehouse of his predecessors , and guardian of their bones .
will you to scone ?
no , cousin , i to fife .

let your highness command upon me , to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie for ever knit .
ride you this afternoon ?
ay , my good lord .
we should have else desired your good advice , which still hath been both grave and prosperous , in this day council , but we take .
far you ride ?
as far , my lord , as will fill up the time this and supper go not my horse the better , i must become a borrower of the night for a dark hour or twain .
fail not our feast .
my lord , i will not .
we hear , our bloody cousins are bestow in england and in ireland , not confessing their cruel parricide , filling their hearers with strange invention but of that , when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly .

i wish your horses swift and sure of foot , and so i do commend you to their backs .

exeunt all but macbeth , and an attendant sirrah , a word with you attend those men our pleasure ?
they are , my lord , without the palace gate .
bring them before us .
exit attendant to be thus is nothing , but to be safely our fears in banquo stick deep , and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear is much he dares , and , to that dauntless temper of his mind , he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety .
there is none but he whose being i do fear and , under him , my genius is rebuked , as , it is said , mark antony was by caesar .
he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me , and bade them speak to him then they hail him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown , and put a barren sceptre in my gripe , thence to be wrench with an unlineal hand , no son of mine succeeding .
if be so , for banquo issue have i filed my mind , for them the gracious duncan have i murder , put rancours in the vessel of my peace only for them , and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man , to make them kings , the seed of banquo kings !
rather than so , come fate into the list .
and champion me to the utterance !
who there !
attendant , with two murderers now go to the door , and stay there till we call .
exit attendant was it not yesterday we spoke together ?
it was , so please your highness .
well then , now have you consider of my speeches ?
know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune , which you thought had been our innocent self this i made good to you in our last conference , pass in probation with you , how you were borne in hand , how cross , the instruments , who wrought with them , and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say did banquo . '
you made it known to us .
i did so , and went further , which is now our point of second meeting .
do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go ?
are you so gospell to pray for this good man and for his issue , whose heavy hand hath bow you to the grave and beggar yours for ever ?
we are men , my liege .
ay , in the catalogue ye go for men , as hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , curs , shoughs , and , are clept all by the name of dogs the valued file distinguishes the swift , the slow , the subtle , the housekeeper , the hunter , every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed , whereby he does receive particular addition .
from the bill that writes them all alike and so of men .
now , if you have a station in the file , not i ' the worst rank of manhood , say , and i will put that business in your bosoms , whose execution takes your enemy off , grapples you to the heart and love of us , who wear our health but sickly in his life , which in his death were perfect .
i am one , my liege , whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that i am reckless what i do to spite the world .
and i another so weary with disasters , tugg with fortune , that i would set my lie on any chance , to mend it , or be rid o .
both of you know banquo was your enemy .
true , my lord .
so is he mine , and in such bloody distance , that every minute of his being thrusts against my of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it , yet i must not , for certain friends that are both his and mine , whose loves i may not drop , but wail his fall who i myself struck down , and thence it is , that i to your assistance do make love , masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons .
we shall , my lord , perform what you command us .
though our lives your spirits shine through you .
within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves , acquaint you with the perfect spy o ' the time , the moment o , must be done , and something from the palace , always thought that i require a clearness and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work fleance his son , that keeps him company , whose absence is no less material to me than is his father , must embrace the fate of that dark hour .
resolve yourselves apart i come to you anon .
we are resolved , my lord .
i call upon you straight abide within .
exeunt murderers it is concluded .
banquo , thy soul flight , if it find heaven , must find it out .
exit scene ii .

ay , madam , but returns again .
say to the king , i would attend his leisure for a few words .
madam , i will .
exit nought had , all spent , where our desire is got without content is safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy .
enter macbeth how now , my lord !
why do you keep alone , of sorriest fancies your companions making , using those thoughts which should indeed have died with them they think on ?
things without all remedy should be without regard what done is done .
we have scotch the snake , not kill it she close and be herself , whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth .
but let the frame of things disjoint , both the worlds suffer , ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly better be with the dead , whom we , to gain our peace , have sent to peace , than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy .
duncan is in his grave , after life fitful fever he sleeps well , treason has done his worst nor steel , nor poison , malice domestic , foreign levy , nothing , can touch him further .
come on , gentle my lord , sleek your rugged looks , be bright and jovial among your guests .
so shall i , love , and so , i pray , be you let your remembrance apply to banquo , present him eminence , both with eye and tongue unsafe the while , that we must lave our honours in these flattering streams , and make our faces vizards to our hearts , disguising what they are .
you must leave this .
o , full of scorpions is my mind , dear wife !
thou that banquo , and his fleance , lives .
but in them nature copy not eterne .
there comfort yet , they are assailable , then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown his cloister flight , ere to black hecate summons the beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night yawning peal , there shall be done a deed of dreadful note .
what to be done ?
be innocent of the knowledge , dearest chuck , till thou applaud the deed .
come , seeling night , scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day , and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale !
light thickens , and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood good things of day begin to droop and drowse , while night black agents to their preys do rouse .
thou at my words but hold thee still , things bad begun make strong themselves by so , prithee , go with me .

o proper stuff !
this is the very painting of your fear this is the dagger which , you said , led you to duncan .
o , these flaws and starts , impostors to true fear , would well become a woman story at a winter fire , authorized by her grandam .
shame itself !
why do you make such faces ?

blood hath been shed ere now , i ' the olden time , ere human statute purged the gentle weal , ay , and since too , murders have been perform too terrible for the ear the times have been , that , when the brains were out , the man would die , and there an end , but now they rise again , with twenty mortal murders on their crowns , and push us from our stools this is more strange than such a murder is .
my worthy lord , your noble friends do lack you .

ghost of banquo avaunt !
and quit my sight !
let the earth hide thee !
thy bones are marrowless , thy blood is cold , thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with !
think of this , good peers , but as a thing of custom is no other , only it spoils the pleasure of the time .
what man dare , i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear , the arm rhinoceros , or the hyrcan tiger , take any shape but that , and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again , and dare me to the desert with thy sword , if trembling i inhabit then , protest me the baby of a girl .
hence , horrible shadow !
unreal mockery , hence !
ghost of banquo vanishes why , so being gone , i am a man again .
pray you , sit still .
you have displaced the mirth , broke the good meeting , with most admired disorder .
can such things be , and overcome us like a summer cloud , without our special wonder ?
you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe , when now i think you can behold such sights , and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks , when mine is blanched with fear .
what sights , my lord ?
i pray you , speak not , he grows worse and worse , question enrages him .
at once , good night stand not upon the order of your going , but go at once .
good night , and better health attend his majesty !
a kind good night to all !
exeunt all but macbeth and lady macbeth it will have blood , they say , blood will have blood stones have been known to move and trees to speak , augurs and understood relations have by and choughs and rooks brought forth the man of blood .
what is the night ?
almost at odds with morning , which is which .
how thou , that macduff denies his person at our great bidding ?
did you send to him , sir ?
i hear it by the way , but i will send there not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant fee .
i will , and betimes i will , to the weird sisters more shall they speak , for now i am bent to know , by the worst means , the worst .
for mine own good , all causes shall give way i am in blood stepp in so far that , should i wade no more , returning were as tedious as go strange things i have in head , that will to hand , which must be acted ere they may be scann .

enter the three witches meeting hecate why , how now , hecate !
you look angerly .
have i not reason , beldams as you are , saucy and overbold ?
how did you dare to trade and traffic with macbeth in riddles and affairs of death , and i , the mistress of your charms , the close contriver of all harms , was never call to bear my part , or show the glory of our art ?
and , which is worse , all you have done hath been but for a wayward son , spiteful and wrathful , who , as others do , loves for his own ends , not for you .
but make amends now get you gone , and at the pit of acheron meet me i ' the morning thither he will come to know his destiny your vessels and your spells provide , your charms and every thing beside .
i am for the air , this night i spend unto a dismal and a fatal end great business must be wrought ere noon upon the corner of the moon there hangs a vaporous drop profound , i catch it ere it come to ground and that distill by magic sleights shall raise such artificial sprites as by the strength of their illusion shall draw him on to his confusion he shall spurn fate , scorn death , and bear he hopes wisdom , grace and fear and you all know , security is mortals ' chiefest enemy .

exeunt scene vi .
forres .
the palace .
enter lennox and another lord my former speeches have but hit your thoughts , which can interpret further only , i say , things have been strangely borne .
the gracious duncan was pitied of macbeth marry , he was dead and the banquo walk too late , whom , you may say , please you , fleance kill , for fleance fled men must not walk too late .
who can not want the thought how monstrous it was for malcolm and for donalbain to kill their gracious father ?
damned fact !
how it did grieve macbeth !
did he not straight in pious rage the two delinquents tear , that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep ?
was not that nobly done ?
ay , and wisely too , for have anger any heart alive to hear the men .
so that , i say , he has borne all things well and i do think that had he duncan sons under his key as , a please heaven , he shall not they should find what to kill a father , so should fleance .
but , peace !
for from broad words and he fail his presence at the tyrant feast , i hear macduff lives in disgrace sir , can you tell where he bestows himself ?
the son of duncan , from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth lives in the english court , and is received of the most pious edward with such grace that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect thither macduff is gone to pray the holy king , upon his aid to wake northumberland and warlike siward that , by the help of these with him above to ratify the work we may again give to our tables meat , sleep to our nights , free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives , do faithful homage and receive free honours all which we pine for now and this report hath so exasperate the king that he prepares for some attempt of war .
sent he to macduff ?
he did and with an absolute , not i , ' the cloudy messenger turns me his back , and hums , as who should say rue the time that clogs me with this answer . '
and that well might advise him to a caution , to hold what distance his wisdom can provide .
some holy angel fly to the court of england and unfold his message ere he come , that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accursed !
i send my prayers with him .

what you do ?
a deed without a name .
i conjure you , by that which you profess , you come to know it , answer me though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches , though the yesty waves confound and swallow navigation up , though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down , though castles topple on their warders ' heads , though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations , though the treasure of nature germens tumble all together , even till destruction sicken , answer me to what i ask you .

why sinks that cauldron ?
and what noise is this ?
hautboys show !

a show of eight kings , the last with a glass in his hand , ghost of banquo following thou art too like the spirit of banquo down !

a seventh !
i see no more and yet the eighth appears , who bears a glass which shows me many more , and some i see that balls and treble scepters carry horrible sight !
now , i see , is true , for the banquo smiles upon me , and points at them for his .
apparitions vanish what , is this so ?
ay , sir , all this is so but why stands macbeth thus amazedly ?
come , sisters , cheer we up his sprites , and show the best of our delights i charm the air to give a sound , while you perform your antic round that this great king may kindly say , our duties did his welcome pay .

let this pernicious hour stand aye accursed in the calendar !
come in , without there !
enter lennox what your grace will ?
saw you the weird sisters ?
no , my lord .
came they not by you ?

infected be the air whereon they ride , and damn all those that trust them !
i did hear the galloping of horse who came by ?
is two or three , my lord , that bring you word macduff is fled to england .
fled to england !
ay , my good lord .
time , thou anticipatest my dread exploits the flighty purpose never is unless the deed go with it , from this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand .
and even now , to crown my thoughts with acts , be it thought and done the castle of macduff i will surprise , seize upon fife , give to the edge o ' the sword his wife , his babes , and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line .
no boasting like a fool , this deed i do before this purpose cool .
but no more sights ! where are these gentlemen ?
come , bring me where they are .
exeunt scene ii .
fife .
macduff castle .
enter lady macduff , her son , and ross what had he done , to make him fly the land ?
you must have patience , madam .
he had none his flight was madness when our actions do not , our fears do make us traitors .
you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
wisdom !
to leave his wife , to leave his babes , his mansion and his titles in a place from whence himself does fly ?
he loves us not , he wants the natural touch for the poor wren , the most diminutive of birds , will fight , her young ones in her nest , against the owl .
all is the fear and nothing is the love , as little is the wisdom , where the flight so runs against all reason .
my dearest coz , i pray you , school yourself but for your husband , he is noble , wise , judicious , and best knows the fits o ' the season .
i dare not speak much further , but cruel are the times , when we are traitors and do not know ourselves , when we hold rumour from what we fear , yet know not what we fear , but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move .
i take my leave of you shall not be long but i be here again things at the worst will cease , or else climb upward to what they were before .
my pretty cousin , blessing upon you !
father he is , and yet he fatherless .
i am so much a fool , should i stay longer , it would be my disgrace and your discomfort i take my leave at once .
exit sirrah , your father dead , and what will you do now ?
how will you live ?
as birds do , mother .
what , with worms and flies ?
with what i get , i mean , and so do they .
poor bird !
never fear the net nor lime , the pitfall nor the gin .
why should i , mother ?
poor birds they are not set for .
my father is not dead , for all your saying .
yes , he is dead , how wilt thou do for a father ?
nay , how will you do for a husband ?
why , i can buy me twenty at any market .
then you buy to sell again .
thou with all thy wit and yet , i ' faith , with wit enough for thee .
was my father a traitor , mother ?
ay , that he was .
what is a traitor ?
why , one that swears and lies .
and be all traitors that do so ?
every one that does so is a traitor , and must be hanged .
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?
every one .
who must hang them ?
why , the honest men .
then the liars and swearers are fools , for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them .
now , god help thee , poor monkey !
but how wilt thou do for a father ?
if he were dead , weep for him if you would not , it were a good sign that i should quickly have a new father .
poor prattler , how thou !
enter a messenger bless you , fair dame !
i am not to you known , though in your state of honour i am perfect .
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly if you will take a homely man advice , be not found here , hence , with your little ones .
to fright you thus , methinks , i am too savage , to do worse to you were fell cruelty , which is too nigh your person .
heaven preserve you !
i dare abide no longer .
exit whither should i fly ?
i have done no harm .
but i remember now i am in this earthly world , where to do harm is often laudable , to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly why then , alas , do i put up that womanly defence , to say i have done no harm ?
enter murderers what are these faces ?
where is your husband ?
i hope , in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him .
he a traitor .
thou liest , thou villain !
what , you egg !
stabbing him young fry of treachery !
he has kill me , mother run away , i pray you !
dies exit lady macduff , crying ! '
exeunt murderers , following her scene iii .
england .
before the king palace .
enter malcolm and macduff let us seek out some desolate shade , and there weep our sad bosoms empty .
let us rather hold fast the mortal sword , and like good men bestride our birthdom each new morn new widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows strike heaven on the face , that it resounds as if it felt with scotland and yell out like syllable of dolour .
what i believe i wail , what know believe , and what i can redress , as i shall find the time to friend , i will .
what you have spoke , it may be so perchance .
this tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , was once thought honest you have loved him well .
he hath not touch you yet .
i am young , but something you may deserve of him through me , and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god .
i am not treacherous .
but macbeth is .
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge .
but i shall crave your pardon , that which you are my thoughts can not transpose angels are bright still , though the brightest fell , though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , yet grace must still look so .
i have lost my hopes .
perchance even there where i did find my doubts .
why in that rawness left you wife and child , those precious motives , those strong knots of love , without ?
i pray you , let not my jealousies be your dishonours , but mine own safeties .
you may be rightly just , whatever i shall think .
bleed , bleed , poor country !
great tyranny !
lay thou thy basis sure , for goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou thy wrongs , the title is affeer !
fare thee well , lord i would not be the villain that thou for the whole space that in the tyrant grasp , and the rich east to boot .
be not offended i speak not as in absolute fear of you .
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke , it weeps , it bleeds , and each new day a gash is added to her wounds i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right , and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands but , for all this , when i shall tread upon the tyrant head , or wear it on my sword , yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before , more suffer and more sundry ways than ever , by him that shall succeed .
what should he be ?
it is myself i mean in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that , when they shall be open , black macbeth will seem as pure as snow , and the poor state esteem him as a lamb , being compared with my confineless harms .
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damn in evils to top macbeth .
i grant him bloody , luxurious , avaricious , false , deceitful , sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin that has a name but there no bottom , none , in my voluptuousness your wives , your daughters , your matrons and your maids , could not fill up the cistern of my lust , and my desire all continent impediments would that did oppose my will better macbeth than such an one to reign .
boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny , it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings .
but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , and yet seem cold , the time you may so hoodwink .
we have willing dames enough there can not be that vulture in you , to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves , finding it so inclined .
with this there grows in my most affection such a stanchless avarice that , were i king , i should cut off the nobles for their lands , desire his jewels and this other house and my would be as a sauce to make me hunger more , that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal , destroying them for wealth .
this avarice sticks deeper , grows with more pernicious root than lust , and it hath been the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear , scotland hath foisons to fill up your will .
of your mere own all these are portable , with other graces weigh .
but i have none the graces , as justice , verity , temperance , stableness , bounty , perseverance , mercy , lowliness , devotion , patience , courage , fortitude , i have no relish of them , but abound in the division of each several crime , acting it many ways .
nay , had i power , i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell , uproar the universal peace , confound all unity on earth .
o scotland , scotland !
if such a one be fit to govern , speak i am as i have spoken .
fit to govern !
no , not to live .
o nation miserable , with an untitled tyrant , when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again , since that the truest issue of thy throne by his own interdiction stands accursed , and does blaspheme his breed ?
thy royal father was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee , oftener upon her knees than on her feet , died every day she lived .
fare thee well !
these evils thou upon thyself have banish me from scotland .
o my breast , thy hope ends here !
macduff , this noble passion , child of integrity , hath from my soul wiped the black scruples , reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honour .
devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power , and modest wisdom plucks me from haste but god above deal between thee and me !
for even now i put myself to thy direction , and unspeak mine own detraction , here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself , for strangers to my nature .
i am yet unknown to woman , never was forsworn , scarcely have coveted what was mine own , at no time broke my faith , would not betray the devil to his fellow and delight no less in truth than life my first false speaking was this upon myself what i am truly , is thine and my poor country to command whither indeed , before thy , old siward , with ten thousand warlike men , already at a point , was setting forth .
now we together , and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel !
why are you silent ?
such welcome and unwelcome things at once is hard to reconcile .
enter a doctor well , more comes the king forth , i pray you ?
ay , sir , there are a crew of wretched souls that stay his cure their malady convinces the great assay of art , but at his touch such sanctity hath heaven given his hand they presently amend .
i thank you , doctor .
exit doctor what the disease he means ?
is call the evil a most miraculous work in this good king , which often , since my in england , i have seen him do .
how he solicits heaven , himself best knows but people , all swoln and ulcerous , pitiful to the eye , the mere despair of surgery , he cures , hanging a golden stamp about their necks , put on with holy prayers and is spoken , to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction .
with this strange virtue , he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy , and sundry blessings hang about his throne , that speak him full of grace .
enter ross see , who comes here ?
my countryman , but yet i know him not .
my cousin , welcome hither .
i know him now .
good god , betimes remove the means that makes us strangers !
sir , amen .
stands scotland where it did ?
alas , poor country !
almost afraid to know itself .
it can not be call our mother , but our grave , where nothing , but who knows nothing , is once seen to smile , where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air are made , not mark , where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy , the dead man knell is there scarce ask for who , and good men lives expire before the flowers in their caps , dying or ere they sicken .
o , relation too nice , and yet too true !
what the newest grief ?
that of an hour age doth hiss the speaker each minute teems a new one .
how does my wife ?
why , well .
and all my children ?
well too .
the tyrant has not batter at their peace ?
no , they were well at peace when i did leave .
but not a niggard of your speech how ?
when i came hither to transport the tidings , which i have heavily borne , there ran a rumour of many worthy fellows that were out , which was to my belief witness the rather , for that i saw the tyrant power now is the time of help , your eye in scotland would create soldiers , make our women fight , to doff their dire distresses .
their comfort we are coming thither gracious england hath lent us good siward and ten thousand men , an older and a better soldier none that christendom gives out .
would i could answer this comfort with the like !
but i have words that would be howl out in the desert air , where hearing should not latch them .
what concern they ?
the general cause ?
or is it a due to some single breast ?
no mind that honest but in it shares some woe , though the main part pertains to you alone .
if it be mine , keep it not from me , quickly let me have it .
let not your ears despise my tongue for ever , which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard .
hum !
i guess at it .
your castle is surprised , your wife and babes savagely slaughter to relate the manner , were , on the quarry of these murder deer , to add the death of you .
merciful heaven !
what , man !
pull your hat upon your brows , give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the heart and bids it break .
my children too ?
wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
and i must be from thence !
my wife kill too ?
i have said .
be comforted let make us medicines of our great revenge , to cure this deadly grief .
he has no children .
all my pretty ones ?
did you say all ?
o !
all ?
what , all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop ?
dispute it like a man .
i shall do so , but i must also feel it as a man i can not but remember such things were , that were most precious to me .
did heaven look on , and would not take their part ?
sinful macduff , they were all struck for thee !
naught that i am , not for their own demerits , but for mine , fell slaughter on their souls .
heaven rest them now !
be this the whetstone of your sword let grief convert to anger , blunt not the heart , enrage it .
o , i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue !
but , gentle heavens , cut short all intermission , front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself , within my sword length set him , if he , heaven forgive him too !
this tune goes manly .
come , go we to the king , our power is ready , our lack is nothing but our leave , macbeth is ripe for shaking , and the powers above put on their instruments .
receive what cheer you may the night is long that never finds the day .

since his majesty went into the field , i have seen her rise from her bed , throw her upon her , unlock her closet , take forth paper , fold it , write upo , read it , afterwards seal it , and again return to bed , yet all this while in a most fast sleep .
a great perturbation in nature , to receive at once the benefit of sleep , and do the effects of watching !
in this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say ?
that , sir , which i will not report after her .
you may to me and is most meet you should .
neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
enter lady macbeth , with a taper lo you , here she comes !
this is her very guise , and , upon my life , fast asleep .
observe her , stand close .
how came she by that light ?
why , it stood by her she has light by her continually , is her command .
you see , her eyes are open .
ay , but their sense is shut .
what is it she does now ?
look , how she rubs her hands .
it is an accustomed action with her , to seem thus washing her hands i have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour .
yet here a spot .
hark !
she speaks i will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
out , damned spot !
out , i say ! one two why , then , is time to hell is murky ! fie , my lord , fie !
a soldier , and afeard ?
what need we fear who knows it , when none can call our power to account ? yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him .
do you mark that ?
the thane of fife had a wife where is she now ? what , will these hands be clean ? no more o ' that , my lord , no more o ' that you mar all with this starting .
go to , go to , you have known what you should not .
she has spoke what she should not , i am sure of that heaven knows what she has known .
here the smell of the blood still all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand .
oh , oh , oh !
what a sigh is there !
the heart is sorely charged .
i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
well , well , well , pray god it be , sir .
this disease is beyond my practise yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
wash your hands , put on your nightgown , look not so i tell you yet again , banquo buried , he can not come out on grave .
even so ?
to bed , to bed !
there knocking at the gate come , come , come , come , give me your hand .
what done can not be to bed , to bed , to bed !
exit will she go now to bed ?
directly .
foul whisperings are abroad unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles infected minds to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets more needs she the divine than the physician .
god , god forgive us all !
look after her , remove from her the means of all annoyance , and still keep eyes upon her .
so , good night my mind she has mated , and amazed my sight .
i think , but dare not speak .
good night , good doctor .

near birnam wood shall we well meet them , that way are they coming .
who knows if donalbain be with his brother ?
for certain , sir , he is not i have a file of all the gentry there is siward son , and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood .
what does the tyrant ?
great dunsinane he strongly fortifies some say he mad , others that lesser hate him do call it valiant fury but , for certain , he can not buckle his distemper cause within the belt of rule .
now does he feel his secret murders sticking on his hands , now minutely revolts upbraid his , those he commands move only in command , nothing in love now does he feel his title hang loose about him , like a giant robe upon a dwarfish thief .
who then shall blame his pester senses to recoil and start , when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there ?
well , march we on , to give obedience where is truly owed meet we the medicine of the sickly weal , and with him pour we in our country purge each drop of us .
or so much as it needs , to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds .
make we our march towards birnam .

the spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus not , macbeth , no man that born of woman shall have power upon thee . '

take thy face hence .
exit servant seyton ! i am sick at heart , when i behold seyton , i say ! this push will cheer me ever , or disseat me now .
i have lived long enough my way of life is into the sear , the yellow leaf , and that which should accompany old age , as honour , love , obedience , troops of friends , i must not look to have , but , in their stead , curses , not loud but deep , , breath , which the poor heart would fain deny , and dare not .
seyton !
enter seyton what is your gracious pleasure ?
what news more ?
all is confirm , my lord , which was reported .
i fight till from my bones my flesh be hack .
give me my armour .
is not needed yet .
i put it on .
send out more horses , skirr the country round , hang those that talk of fear .
give me mine armour .
how does your patient , doctor ?
not so sick , my lord , as she is troubled with thick coming fancies , that keep her from her rest .
cure her of that .
canst thou not minister to a mind diseased , pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow , raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuff bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart ?
therein the patient must minister to himself .
throw physic to the dogs , i none of it .
come , put mine armour on , give me my staff .
seyton , send out .
doctor , the thanes fly from me .
come , sir , dispatch .
if thou couldst , doctor , cast the water of my land , find her disease , and purge it to a sound and pristine health , i would applaud thee to the very echo , that should applaud off , i what rhubarb , cyme , or what purgative drug , would scour these english hence ?
thou of them ?
ay , my good lord , your royal preparation makes us hear something .
bring it after me .
i will not be afraid of death and bane , till birnam forest come to dunsinane .

what wood is this before us ?
the wood of birnam .
let every soldier hew him down a bough and before him thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us .
it shall be done .
we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dunsinane , and will endure our setting down before .
is his main hope for where there is advantage to be given , both more and less have given him the revolt , and none serve with him but constrained things whose hearts are absent too .
let our just censures attend the true event , and put we on industrious soldiership .
the time approaches that will with due decision make us know what we shall say we have and what we owe .
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate , but certain issue strokes must arbitrate towards which advance the war .

a cry of women within what is that noise ?
it is the cry of women , my good lord .
exit i have almost forgot the taste of fears , the time has been , my senses would have cool to hear a , and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were i i have supp full with horrors , direness , familiar to my slaughterous thoughts can not once start me .
seyton wherefore was that cry ?
the queen , my lord , is dead .
she should have died hereafter , there would have been a time for such a word .
, and , and , creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time , and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death .
out , out , brief candle !
life but a walking shadow , a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .
enter a messenger thou comest to use thy tongue , thy story quickly .
gracious my lord , i should report that which i say i saw , but know not how to do it .
well , say , sir .
as i did stand my watch upon the hill , i look toward birnam , and anon , methought , the wood began to move .
liar and slave !
let me endure your wrath , be not so within this three mile may you see it coming , i say , a moving grove .
if thou false , upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive , till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth , i care not if thou dost for me as much .
i pull in resolution , and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth not , till birnam wood do come to dunsinane ' and now a wood comes toward dunsinane .

your son , my lord , has paid a soldier debt he only lived but till he was a man , the which no sooner had his prowess confirm in the unshrinking station where he fought , but like a man he died .
then he is dead ?
ay , and brought off the field your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth , for then it hath no end .
had he his hurts before ?
ay , on the front .
why then , god soldier be he !
had i as many sons as i have hairs , i would not wish them to a fairer death and so , his knell is knoll .
he worth more sorrow , and that i spend for him .
he worth no more they say he parted well , and paid his score and so , god be with him !
here comes newer comfort .

my lord .
of government the properties to unfold , would seem in me to affect speech and discourse , since i am put to know that your own science exceeds , in that , the lists of all advice my strength can give you then no more remains , but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able , and let them work .
the nature of our people , our city institutions , and the terms for common justice , you as pregnant in as art and practise hath enriched any that we remember .
there is our commission , from which we would not have you warp .
call hither , i say , bid come before us angelo .
exit an attendant what figure of us think you he will bear ?
for you must know , we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply , lent him our terror , dress him with our love , and given his deputation all the organs of our own power what think you of it ?
if any in vienna be of worth to undergo such ample grace and honour , it is lord angelo .
look where he comes .
enter angelo always obedient to your grace will , i come to know your pleasure .
angelo , there is a kind of character in thy life , that to the observer doth thy history fully unfold .
thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues , they on thee .
heaven doth with us as we with torches do , not light them for themselves , for if our virtues did not go forth of us , all alike as if we had them not .
spirits are not finely touch but to fine issues , nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but , like a thrifty goddess , she determines herself the glory of a creditor , both thanks and use .
but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise , hold therefore , angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself , mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus , though first in question , is thy secondary .
take thy commission .
now , good my lord , let there be some more test made of my metal , before so noble and so great a figure be stamp upon it .
no more evasion we have with a leaven and prepared choice proceeded to you , therefore take your honours .
our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves unquestion matters of needful value .
we shall write to you , as time and our concernings shall importune , how it goes with us , and do look to know what doth befall you here .
so , fare you well , to the hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions .
yet give leave , my lord , that we may bring you something on the way .
my haste may not admit it , nor need you , on mine honour , have to do with any scruple , your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good .
give me your hand i privily away .
i love the people , but do not like to stage me to their eyes through it do well , i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement , nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it .
once more , fare you well .
the heavens give safety to your purposes !
lead forth and bring you back in happiness !
i thank you .
fare you well .
exit i shall desire you , sir , to give me leave to have free speech with you , and it concerns me to look into the bottom of my place a power i have , but of what strength and nature i am not yet instructed .
is so with me .
let us withdraw together , and we may soon our satisfaction have touching that point .
i wait upon your honour .

enter lucio and two gentlemen if the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the king of hungary , why then all the dukes fall upon the king .
heaven grant us its peace , but not the king of hungary !
amen .
thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate , that went to sea with the ten commandments , but scraped one out of the table .
shalt not steal ' ?
ay , that he razed .
why , was a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal .
there not a soldier of us all , that , in the thanksgiving before meat , do relish the petition well that prays for peace .
i never heard any soldier dislike it .
i believe thee , for i think thou never wast where grace was said .
no ?
a dozen times at least .
what , in metre ?
in any proportion or in any language .
i think , or in any religion .
ay , why not ?
grace is grace , despite of all controversy as , for example , thou thyself art a wicked villain , despite of all grace .
well , there went but a pair of shears between us .
i grant , as there may between the lists and the velvet .
thou art the list .
and thou the velvet thou art good velvet , a piece , i warrant thee i had as lief be a list of an english kersey as be piled , as thou art piled , for a french velvet .
do i speak feelingly now ?
i think thou dost , and , indeed , with most painful feeling of thy speech i will , out of thine own confession , learn to begin thy health , but , whilst i live , forget to drink after thee .
i think i have done myself wrong , have i not ?
yes , that thou hast , whether thou art tainted or free .
behold , behold .
where madam mitigation comes !
i have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to to what , i pray ?
judge .
to three thousand dolours a year .
ay , and more .
a french crown more .
thou art always figuring diseases in me , but thou art full of error , i am sound .
nay , not as one would say , healthy , but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow , impiety has made a feast of thee .
enter mistress overdone how now !
which of your hips has the most profound sciatica ?
well , well , there one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all .
who that , i pray thee ?
marry , sir , that claudio , signior claudio .
claudio to prison ?
is not so .
nay , but i know is so i saw him arrested , saw him carried away , and , which is more , within these three days his head to be chopped off .
but , after all this fooling , i would not have it so .
art thou sure of this ?
i am too sure of it and it is for getting madam julietta with child .
believe me , this may be he promised to meet me two hours since , and he was ever precise in .
besides , you know , it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose .
but , most of all , agreeing with the proclamation .
away !
let go learn the truth of it .
exeunt lucio and gentlemen thus , what with the war , what with the sweat , what with the gallows and what with poverty , i am .
enter pompey how now !
what the news with you ?
yonder man is carried to prison .
well , what has he done ?
a woman .
but what his offence ?
groping for trouts in a peculiar river .
what , is there a maid with child by him ?
no , but there a woman with maid by him .
you have not heard of the proclamation , have you ?
what proclamation , man ?
all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down .
and what shall become of those in the city ?
they shall stand for seed they had gone down too , but that a wise burgher put in for them .
but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down ?
to the ground , mistress .
why , here a change indeed in the commonwealth !
what shall become of me ?
come , fear you not good counsellors lack no clients though you change your place , you need not change your trade , i be your tapster still .
courage !
there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service , you will be considered .
what to do here , thomas tapster ?
let withdraw .
here comes signior claudio , led by the provost to prison , and there madam juliet .
exeunt enter provost , claudio , juliet , and officers fellow , why dost thou show me thus to the world ?
bear me to prison , where i am committed .
i do it not in evil disposition , but from lord angelo by special charge .
thus can the demigod authority make us pay down for our offence by weight the words of heaven , on whom it will , it will , on whom it will not , so , yet still is just .
lucio and two gentlemen why , how now , claudio !
whence comes this restraint ?
from too much liberty , my lucio , liberty as surfeit is the father of much fast , so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint .
our natures do pursue , like rats that ravin down their proper bane , a thirsty evil , and when we drink we die .
if could speak so wisely under an arrest , i would send for certain of my creditors and yet , to say the truth , i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment .
what thy offence , claudio ?
what but to speak of would offend again .
what , murder ?
no .
lechery ?
call it so .
away , sir !
you must go .
one word , good friend .
lucio , a word with you .
a hundred , if they do you any good .
is lechery so look after ?
thus stands it with me upon a true contract i got possession of julietta bed you know the lady , she is fast my wife , save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order this we came not to , only for propagation of a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends , from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us .
but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet .
with child , perhaps ?
unhappily , even so .
and the new deputy now for the duke whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness , or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride , who , newly in the seat , that it may know he can command , lets it straight feel the spur , whether the tyranny be in his place , or in his emmence that fills it up , i stagger in but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have , like unscour armour , hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn , and , for a name , now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me is surely for a name .
i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid , if she be in love , may sigh it off .
send after the duke and appeal to him .
i have done so , but he not to be found .
i prithee , lucio , do me this kind service this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her , in my voice , that she make friends to the strict deputy , bid herself assay him i have great hope in that , for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect , such as move men , beside , she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse , and well she can persuade .
i pray she may , as well for the encouragement of the like , which else would stand under grievous imposition , as for the enjoying of thy life , who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of .
i to her .
i thank you , good friend lucio .
within two hours .
come , officer , away !
exeunt scene iii .
a monastery .
enter duke vincentio and friar thomas no , holy father , throw away that thought , believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom .
why i desire thee to give me secret harbour , hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth .
may your grace speak of it ?
my holy sir , none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth , and cost , and witless bravery keeps .
i have deliver to lord angelo , a man of stricture and firm abstinence , my absolute power and place here in vienna , and he supposes me travell to poland , for so i have strew it in the common ear , and so it is received .
now , pious sir , you will demand of me why i do this ?
gladly , my lord .
we have strict statutes and most biting laws .
the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds , which for this nineteen years we have let slip , even like an lion in a cave , that goes not out to prey .
now , as fond fathers , having bound up the threatening twigs of birch , only to stick it in their children sight for terror , not to use , in time the rod becomes more mock than fear , so our decrees , dead to infliction , to themselves are dead , and liberty plucks justice by the nose , the baby beats the nurse , and quite athwart goes all decorum .
it rested in your grace to unloose this justice when you pleased and it in you more dreadful would have seem than in lord angelo .
i do fear , too dreadful sith was my fault to give the people scope , be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done , when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment .
therefore indeed , my father , i have on angelo imposed the office , who may , in the ambush of my name , strike home , and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander .
and to behold his sway , i will , as a brother of your order , visit both prince and people therefore , i prithee , supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar .
more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you , only , this one lord angelo is precise , stands at a guard with envy , scarce confesses that his blood flows , or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see , if power change purpose , what our seemers be .
exeunt scene iv .
a nunnery .
enter isabella and francisca and have you nuns no farther privileges ?
are not these large enough ?
yes , truly , i speak not as desiring more , but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood , the votarists of saint clare .
within ho !
peace be in this place !
who that which calls ?
it is a man voice .
gentle isabella , turn you the key , and know his business of him , you may , i may not , you are yet unsworn .
when you have vow , you must not speak with men but in the presence of the prioress then , if you speak , you must not show your face , or , if you show your face , you must not speak .
he calls again , i pray you , answer him .
exit peace and prosperity !
who that calls enter lucio hail , virgin , if you be , as those proclaim you are no less !
can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella , a novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio ?
why unhappy brother ' ?
let me ask , the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister .
gentle and fair , your brother kindly greets you not to be weary with you , he in prison .
woe me !
for what ?
for that which , if myself might be his judge , he should receive his punishment in thanks he hath got his friend with child .
sir , make me not your story .
it is true .
i would not though is my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest , tongue far from heart play with all virgins so i hold you as a thing ensky and sainted .
by your renouncement an immortal spirit , and to be talk with in sincerity , as with a saint .
you do blaspheme the good in mocking me .
do not believe it .
fewness and truth , is thus your brother and his lover have embraced as those that feed grow full , as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison , even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry .
some one with child by him ?
my cousin juliet ?
is she your cousin ?
adoptedly , as change their names by vain though apt affection .
she it is .
o , let him marry her .
this is the point .
the duke is very strangely gone from hence , bore many gentlemen , myself being one , in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state , his were of an infinite distance from his design .
upon his place , and with full line of his authority , governs lord angelo , a man whose blood is very , one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense , but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind , study and fast .
he to give fear to use and liberty , which have for long run by the hideous law , as mice by lions hath pick out an act , under whose heavy sense your brother life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it , and follows close the rigour of the statute , to make him an example .
all hope is gone , unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo and that my pith of business you and your poor brother .
doth he so seek his life ?
has censured him already , and , as i hear , the provost hath a warrant for his execution .
alas !
what poor ability in me to do him good ?
assay the power you have .
my power ?
alas , i doubt our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt .
go to lord angelo , and let him learn to know , when maidens sue , men give like gods , but when they weep and kneel , all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them .
i see what i can do .
but speedily .
i will about it straight , no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair .
i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at night i send him certain word of my success .
i take my leave of you .
good sir , adieu .
exeunt act ii scene i .
a hall in angelo house .
enter angelo , escalus , and a justice , provost , officers , and other attendants , behind we must not make a scarecrow of the law , setting it up to fear the birds of prey , and let it keep one shape , till custom make it their perch and not their terror .
ay , but yet let us be keen , and rather cut a little , than fall , and bruise to death .
alas , this gentleman whom i would save , had a most noble father !
let but your honour know , whom i believe to be most strait in virtue , that , in the working of your own affections , had time cohered with place or place with wishing , or that the resolute acting of your blood could have attain the effect of your own purpose , whether you had not sometime in your life err in this point which now you censure him , and pull the law upon you .
is one thing to be tempted , escalus , another thing to fall .
i not deny , the jury , passing on the prisoner life , may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try .
what open made to justice , that justice seizes what know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves ?
is very pregnant , the jewel that we find , we stoop and because we see it , but what we do not see we tread upon , and never think of it .
you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults , but rather tell me , when i , that censure him , do so offend , let mine own judgment pattern out my death , and nothing come in partial .
sir , he must die .
be it as your wisdom will .
where is the provost ?
here , if it like your honour .
see that claudio be executed by nine morning bring him his confessor , let him be prepared , for that the utmost of his pilgrimage .
exit provost aside well , heaven forgive him !
and forgive us all !
some rise by sin , and some by virtue fall some run from brakes of ice , and answer none and some condemned for a fault alone .
enter elbow , and officers with froth and pompey come , bring them away if these be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses , i know no law bring them away .
how now , sir !
what your name ?
and what the matter ?
if it please your honour , i am the poor duke constable , and my name is elbow i do lean upon justice , sir , and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors .
benefactors ?
well , what benefactors are they ?
are they not malefactors ?
if it ?

a tapster , sir , , one that serves a bad woman , whose house , sir , was , as they say , plucked down in the suburbs , and now she professes a , which , i think , is a very ill house too .
how know you that ?
my wife , sir , whom i detest before heaven and your honour , how ?
thy wife ?
ay , sir , whom , i thank heaven , is an honest woman , dost thou detest her therefore ?
i say , sir , i will detest myself also , as well as she , that this house , if it be not a bawd house , it is pity of her life , for it is a naughty house .
how dost thou know that , constable ?
marry , sir , by my wife , who , if she had been a woman cardinally given , might have been accused in fornication , adultery , and all uncleanliness there .
by the woman means ?
ay , sir , by mistress overdone means but as she spit in his face , so she defied him .
sir , if it please your honour , this is not so .
prove it before these varlets here , thou honourable man , prove it .
do you hear how he misplaces ?
sir , she came in great with child , and longing , saving your honour reverence , for stewed prunes , sir , we had but two in the house , which at that very distant time stood , as it were , in a , a dish of some , your honours have seen such dishes , they are not china dishes , but very good dishes , go to , go to no matter for the dish , sir .
no , indeed , sir , not of a pin , you are therein in the right but to the point .
as i say , this mistress elbow , being , as i say , with child , and being , and longing , as i said , for prunes , and having but two in the dish , as i said , master froth here , this very man , having eaten the rest , as i said , and , as i say , paying for them very honestly , for , as you know , master froth , i could not give you again .
no , indeed .
very well you being then , if you be remembered , cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes , ay , so i did indeed .
why , very well , i telling you then , if you be remembered , that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of , unless they kept very good diet , as i told you , all this is true .
why , very well , then , come , you are a tedious fool to the purpose .
what was done to elbow wife , that he hath cause to complain of ?
come me to what was done to her .
sir , your honour can not come to that yet .
no , sir , nor i mean it not .
sir , but you shall come to it , by your honour leave .
and , i beseech you , look into master froth here , sir , a man of pound a year , whose father died at hallowmas not at hallowmas , master froth ?
eve .
why , very well , i hope here be truths .
he , sir , sitting , as i say , in a lower chair , sir , was in the bunch of grapes , where indeed you have a delight to sit , have you not ?
i have so , because it is an open room and good for winter .
why , very well , then , i hope here be truths .
this will last out a night in russia , when nights are longest there i take my leave .
and leave you to the hearing of the cause , hoping you find good cause to whip them all .
i think no less .
good morrow to your lordship .
exit angelo now , sir , come on what was done to elbow wife , once more ?
once , sir ?
there was nothing done to her once .
i beseech you , sir , ask him what this man did to my wife .
i beseech your honour , ask me .
well , sir , what did this gentleman to her ?
i beseech you , sir , look in this gentleman face .
good master froth , look upon his honour , is for a good purpose .
doth your honour mark his face ?
ay , sir , very well .
nay , i beseech you , mark it well .
well , i do so .
doth your honour see any harm in his face ?
why , no .
i be supposed upon a book , his face is the worst thing about him .
good , then , if his face be the worst thing about him , how could master froth do the constable wife any harm ?
i would know that of your honour .
he in the right .
constable , what say you to it ?
first , an it like you , the house is a respected house , next , this is a respected fellow , and his mistress is a respected woman .
by this hand , sir , his wife is a more respected person than any of us all .
varlet , thou liest , thou liest , wicked varlet !
the time has yet to come that she was ever respected with man , woman , or child .
sir , she was respected with him before he married with her .
which is the wiser here ?
justice or iniquity ?
is this true ?
o thou caitiff !
o thou varlet !
o thou wicked hannibal !
i respected with her before i was married to her !
if ever i was respected with her , or she with me , let not your worship think me the poor duke officer .
prove this , thou wicked hannibal , or i have mine action of battery on thee .
if he took you a box o ' the ear , you might have your action of slander too .
marry , i thank your good worship for it .
what your worship pleasure i shall do with this wicked caitiff ?
truly , officer , because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst , let him continue in his courses till thou knowest what they are .
marry , i thank your worship for it .
thou seest , thou wicked varlet , now , what come upon thee thou art to continue now , thou varlet , thou art to continue .
where were you born , friend ?
here in vienna , sir .
are you of fourscore pounds a year ?
yes , a please you , sir .
so .
what trade are you of , sir ?
tapster , a poor widow tapster .

come hither to me , master froth .
master froth , i would not have you acquainted with tapsters they will draw you , master froth , and you will hang them .

come , tell me true it shall be the better for you .
truly , sir , i am a poor fellow that would live .
how would you live , pompey ?
by being a bawd ?
what do you think of the trade , pompey ?
is it a lawful trade ?
if the law would allow it , sir .
but the law will not allow it , pompey , nor it shall not be allowed in vienna .
does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city ?
no , pompey .
truly , sir , in my poor opinion , they will then .
if your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves , you need not to fear the bawds .
there are pretty orders beginning , i can tell you it is but heading and hanging .
if you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together , you be glad to give out a commission for more heads if this law hold in vienna ten year , i rent the fairest house in it after a bay if you live to see this come to pass , say pompey told you so .
thank you , good pompey , and , in requital of your prophecy , hark you i advise you , let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever , no , not for dwelling where you do if i do , pompey , i shall beat you to your tent , and prove a shrewd caesar to you , in plain dealing , pompey , i shall have you whipt so , for this time , pompey , fare you well .
i thank your worship for your good counsel aside but i shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine .
whip me ?
no , no , let carman whip his jade the valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade .
exit come hither to me , master elbow , come hither , master constable .
how long have you been in this place of constable ?
seven year and a half , sir .
i thought , by your readiness in the office , you had continued in it some time .
you say , seven years together ?
and a half , sir .
alas , it hath been great pains to you .
they do you wrong to put you so oft upon are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it ?
faith , sir , few of any wit in such matters as they are chosen , they are glad to choose me for them , i do it for some piece of money , and go through with all .
look you bring me in the names of some six or seven , the most sufficient of your parish .
to your worship house , sir ?
to my house .
fare you well .
exit elbow what , think you ?
eleven , sir .
i pray you home to dinner with me .
i humbly thank you .
it grieves me for the death of claudio , but there no remedy .
lord angelo is severe .
it is but needful mercy is not itself , that oft looks so , pardon is still the nurse of second woe but yet , poor claudio !
there is no remedy .
come , sir .
exeunt scene ii .
another room in the same .
enter provost and a servant he hearing of a cause , he will come straight i tell him of you .
pray you , do .
exit servant i know his pleasure , may be he will relent .
alas , he hath but as offended in a dream !
all sects , all ages smack of this vice , and he to die !
enter angelo now , what the matter .
provost ?
is it your will claudio shall die tomorrow ?
did not i tell thee yea ?
hadst thou not order ?
why dost thou ask again ?
lest i might be too rash under your good correction , i have seen , when , after execution , judgment hath repented his doom .
go to , let that be mine do you your office , or give up your place , and you shall well be spared .
i crave your honour pardon .
what shall be done , sir , with the groaning juliet ?
she very near her hour .
dispose of her to some more fitter place , and that with speed .
servant here is the sister of the man condemn desires access to you .
hath he a sister ?
ay , my good lord , a very virtuous maid , and to be shortly of a sisterhood , if not already .
well , let her be admitted .
exit servant see you the fornicatress be removed let have needful , but not lavish , means , there shall be order .
enter isabella and lucio god save your honour !
stay a little while .
to isabella you welcome what your will ?
i am a woeful suitor to your honour , please but your honour hear me .
well , what your suit ?
there is a vice that most i do abhor , and most desire should meet the blow of justice , for which i would not plead , but that i must , for which i must not plead , but that i am at war will and will not .
well , the matter ?
i have a brother is condemn to die i do beseech you , let it be his fault , and not my brother .
aside heaven give thee moving graces !
condemn the fault and not the actor of it ?
why , every fault condemn ere it be done mine were the very cipher of a function , to fine the faults whose fine stands in record , and let go by the actor .
o just but severe law !
i had a brother , then .
heaven keep your honour !
aside to isabella not so to him again , entreat him , kneel down before him , hang upon his gown you are too cold , if you should need a pin , you could not with more tame a tongue desire it to him , i say !
must he needs die ?
maiden , no remedy .
yes , i do think that you might pardon him , and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy .
i will not .
but can you , if you would ?
look , what i will not , that i can not do .
but might you , and do the world no wrong , if so your heart were touch with that remorse a s mine is to him ?
he sentenced , is too late .
aside to isabella you are too cold .
too late ?
why , no , i , that do speak a word .
may call it back again .
well , believe this , no ceremony that to great ones , not the king crown , nor the deputed sword , the marshal truncheon , nor the judge robe , become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does .
if he had been as you and you as he , you would have slipt like him , but he , like you , would not have been so stern .
pray you , be gone .
i would to heaven i had your potency , and you were isabel !
should it then be thus ?
no , i would tell what to be a judge , and what a prisoner .
aside to isabella ay , touch him , there the vein .
your brother is a forfeit of the law , and you but waste your words .
alas , alas !
why , all the souls that were were forfeit once , and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy .
how would you be , if he , which is the top of judgment , should but judge you as you are ?
o , think on that , and mercy then will breathe within your lips , like man new made .
be you content , fair maid , it is the law , not i condemn your brother were he my kinsman , brother , or my son , it should be thus with him he must die tomorrow .
!
o , that sudden !
spare him , spare him !
he not prepared for death .
even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves ?
good , good my lord , bethink you , who is it that hath died for this offence ?
there many have committed it .
aside to isabella ay , well said .
the law hath not been dead , though it hath slept those many had not dared to do that evil , if the first that did the edict infringe had answer for his deed now is awake takes note of what is done , and , like a prophet , looks in a glass , that shows what future evils , either new , or by remissness , and so in progress to be hatch and born , are now to have no successive degrees , but , ere they live , to end .
yet show some pity .
i show it most of all when i show justice , for then i pity those i do not know , which a dismiss offence would after gall , and do him right that , answering one foul wrong , lives not to act another .
be satisfied , your brother dies , be content .
so you must be the first that gives this sentence , and he , that suffer .
o , it is excellent to have a giant strength , but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant .
aside to isabella that well said .
could great men thunder as jove himself does , jove would be quiet , for every pelting , petty officer would use his heaven for thunder , nothing but thunder !
merciful heaven , thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle but man , proud man , drest in a little brief authority , most ignorant of what he most assured , his glassy essence , like an angry ape , plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep , who , with our spleens , would all themselves laugh mortal .
aside to isabella o , to him , to him , wench !
he will relent , he coming , i perceive .
aside pray heaven she win him !
we can not weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints , is wit in them , but in the less foul profanation .
i ' the right , girl , more o , that .
that in the captain but a choleric word , which in the soldier is flat blasphemy .
aside to isabella art avised o ' that ?
more on .
why do you put these sayings upon me ?
because authority , though it err like others , hath yet a kind of medicine in itself , that skins the vice o ' the top .
go to your bosom , knock there , and ask your heart what it doth know that like my brother fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his , let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brother life .
aside she speaks , and is such sense , that my sense breeds with it .
fare you well .
gentle my lord , turn back .
i will bethink me come again tomorrow .
hark how i bribe you good my lord , turn back .
how !
bribe me ?
ay , with such gifts that heaven shall share with you .
aside to isabella you had marr all else .
not with fond shekels of the tested gold , or stones whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them , but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere , prayers from preserved souls , from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal .
well , come to me .
aside to isabella go to , is well , away !
heaven keep your honour safe !
aside amen for i am that way going to temptation , where prayers cross .
at what hour shall i attend your lordship ?
at any time noon .
your honour !
exeunt isabella , lucio , and provost from thee , even from thy virtue !
what this , what this ?
is this her fault or mine ?
the tempter or the tempted , who sins most ?
ha !
not she nor doth she tempt but it is i that , lying by the violet in the sun , do as the carrion does , not as the flower , corrupt with virtuous season .
can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than woman lightness ?
having waste ground enough , shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there ?
o , fie , fie , fie !
what dost thou , or what art thou , angelo ?
dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good ?
o , let her brother live !
thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves .
what , do i love her , that i desire to hear her speak again , and feast upon her eyes ?
what i dream on ?
o cunning enemy , that , to catch a saint , with saints dost bait thy hook !
most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet , with all her double vigour , art and nature , once stir my temper , but this virtuous maid subdues me quite .
even till now , when men were fond , i smiled and wonder how .
exit scene iii .
a room in a prison .
enter , severally , duke vincentio disguised as a friar , and provost hail to you , provost !
so i think you are .
i am the provost .
what your will , good friar ?
bound by my charity and my blest order , i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison .
do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes , that i may minister to them accordingly .
i would do more than that , if more were needful .
enter juliet look , here comes one a gentlewoman of mine , who , falling in the flaws of her own youth , hath blister her report she is with child , and he that got it , sentenced , a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this .
when must he die ?
as i do think , .
i have provided for you stay awhile , to juliet and you shall be conducted .
repent you , fair one , of the sin you carry ?
i do , and bear the shame most patiently .
i teach you how you shall arraign your conscience , and try your penitence , if it be sound , or hollowly put on .
i gladly learn .
love you the man that wrong you ?
yes , as i love the woman that wrong him .
so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed ?
mutually .
then was your sin of heavier kind than his .
i do confess it , and repent it , father .
is meet so , daughter but lest you do repent , as that the sin hath brought you to this shame , which sorrow is always towards ourselves , not heaven , showing we would not spare heaven as we love it , but as we stand in fear , i do repent me , as it is an evil , and take the shame with joy .
there rest .
your partner , as i hear , must die , and i am going with instruction to him .
grace go with you , benedicite !
exit must die !
o injurious love , that respites me a life , whose very comfort is still a dying horror !
is pity of him .
exeunt scene iv .
a room in angelo house .
enter angelo when i would pray and think , i think and pray to several subjects .
heaven hath my empty words , whilst my invention , hearing not my tongue , anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth , as if i did but only chew his name , and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception .
the state , whereon i studied is like a good thing , being often read , grown fear and tedious , yea , my gravity , wherein let no man hear me i take pride , could i with boot change for an idle plume , which the air beats for vain .
o place , o form , how often dost thou with thy case , thy habit , wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming !
blood , thou art blood let write good angel on the devil horn is not the devil crest .
enter a servant how now !
who there ?
one isabel , a sister , desires access to you .
teach her the way .
exit servant o heavens !
why does my blood thus muster to my heart , making both it unable for itself , and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness ?
so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons , come all to help him , and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general , subject to a king , quit their own part , and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence , where their untaught love must needs appear offence .
enter isabella how now , fair maid ?
i am come to know your pleasure .
that you might know it , would much better please me than to demand what is .
your brother can not live .
even so .
heaven keep your honour !
yet may he live awhile , and , it may be , as long as you or i yet he must die .
under your sentence ?
yea .
when , i beseech you ?
that in his reprieve , longer or shorter , he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not .
ha !
fie , these filthy vices !
it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made , as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven image in stamps that are forbid is all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one .
is set down so in heaven , but not in earth .
say you so ?
then i shall pose you quickly .
which had you rather , that the most just law now took your brother life , or , to redeem him , give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath stain ?
sir , believe this , i had rather give my body than my soul .
i talk not of your soul our compell sins stand more for number than for accompt .
how say you ?
nay , i not warrant that , for i can speak against the thing i say .
answer to this i , now the voice of the recorded law , pronounce a sentence on your brother life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother life ?
please you to , i take it as a peril to my soul , it is no sin at all , but charity .
pleased you to at peril of your soul , were equal poise of sin and charity .
that i do beg his life , if it be sin , heaven let me bear it !
you granting of my suit , if that be sin , i make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine , and nothing of your answer .
nay , but hear me .
your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant , or seem so craftily , and that not good .
let me be ignorant , and in nothing good , but graciously to know i am no better .
thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself , as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could , display .
but mark me , to be received plain , i speak more gross your brother is to die .
so .
and his offence is so , as it appears , accountant to the law upon that pain .
true .
admit no other way to save his life , as i subscribe not that , nor any other , but in the loss of question , that you , his sister , finding yourself desired of such a person , whose credit with the judge , or own great place , could fetch your brother from the manacles of the law , and that there were no earthly mean to save him , but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed , or else to let him suffer , what would you do ?
as much for my poor brother as myself that is , were i under the terms of death , the impression of keen whips wear as rubies , and strip myself to death , as to a bed that longing have been sick for , ere yield my body up to shame .
then must your brother die .
and the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once , than that a sister , by redeeming him , should die for ever .
were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slander so ?
ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption .
you seem of late to make the law a tyrant , and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice .
o , pardon me , my lord , it oft falls out , to have what we would have , we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate , for his advantage that i dearly love .
we are all frail .
else let my brother die , if not a feodary , but only he owe and succeed thy weakness .
nay , women are frail too .
ay , as the glasses where they view themselves , which are as easy broke as they make forms .
women !
help heaven !
men their creation mar in profiting by them .
nay , call us ten times frail , for we are soft as our complexions are , and credulous to false prints .
i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex , since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames , let me be bold , i do arrest your words .
be that you are , that is , a woman , if you be more , you none , if you be one , as you are well express by all external warrants , show it now , by putting on the destined livery .
i have no tongue but one gentle my lord , let me entreat you speak the former language .
plainly conceive , i love you .
my brother did love juliet , and you tell me that he shall die for it .
he shall not , isabel , if you give me love .
i know your virtue hath a licence i , which seems a little fouler than it is , to pluck on others .
believe me , on mine honour , my words express my purpose .
ha !
little honour to be much believed , and most pernicious purpose !
seeming , seeming !
i will proclaim thee , angelo , look sign me a present pardon for my brother , or with an outstretch throat i tell the world aloud what man thou art .
who will believe thee , isabel ?
my unsoil name , the austereness of my life , my vouch against you , and my place i ' the state , will so your accusation overweigh , that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny .
i have begun , and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite , lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes , that banish what they sue for , redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will , or else he must not only die the death , but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance .
answer me , or , by the affection that now guides me most , i prove a tyrant to him .
as for you , say what you can , my false your true .
exit to whom should i complain ?
did i tell this , who would believe me ?
o perilous mouths , that bear in them one and the tongue , either of condemnation or approof , bidding the law make to their will hooking both right and wrong to the appetite , to follow as it draws !
i to my brother though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood , yet hath he in him such a mind of honour .
that , had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks , yield them up , before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorr pollution .
then , isabel , live chaste , and , brother , die more than our brother is our chastity .
i tell him yet of angelo request , and fit his mind to death , for his soul rest .
exit act iii scene i .
a room in the prison .
enter duke vincentio disguised as before , claudio , and provost so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo ?
the miserable have no other medicine but only hope i hope to live , and am prepared to die .
be absolute for death , either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter .
reason thus with life if i do lose thee , i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art , servile to all the skyey influences , that dost this habitation , where thou , hourly afflict merely , thou art death fool , for him thou by thy flight to shun and yet toward him still .
thou art not noble , for all the accommodations that thou are nursed by baseness .
by no means valiant , for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm .
thy best of rest is sleep , and that thou oft provokest , yet grossly thy death , which is no more .
thou art not thyself , for thou on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust .
happy thou art not , for what thou hast not , still thou strivest to get , and what thou hast , .
thou art not certain , for thy complexion shifts to strange effects , after the moon .
if thou art rich , poor , for , like an ass whose back with ingots bows , thou bear thy heavy riches but a journey , and death unloads thee .
friend hast thou none , for thine own bowels , which do call thee sire , the mere effusion of thy proper loins , do curse the gout , serpigo , and the rheum , for ending thee no sooner .
thou hast nor youth nor age , but , as it were , an sleep , dreaming on both , for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged , and doth beg the alms of palsied eld , and when thou art old and rich , thou hast neither heat , affection , limb , nor beauty , to make thy riches pleasant .
what yet in this that bears the name of life ?
yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear , that makes these odds all even .
i humbly thank you .
to sue to live , i find i seek to die , and , seeking death , find life let it come on .
within what , ho !
peace here , grace and good company !
who there ?
come in the wish deserves a welcome .
dear sir , ere long i visit you again .
most holy sir , i thank you .
enter isabella my business is a word or two with claudio .
and very welcome .
look , signior , here your sister .
provost , a word with you .
as many as you please .
bring me to hear them speak , where i may be concealed .
exeunt duke vincentio and provost now , sister , what the comfort ?
why , as all comforts are , most good , most good indeed .
lord angelo , having affairs to heaven , intends you for his swift ambassador , where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed , you set on .
is there no remedy ?
none , but such remedy as , to save a head , to cleave a heart in twain .
but is there any ?
yes , brother , you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge , if you implore it , that will free your life , but fetter you till death .
perpetual durance ?
ay , just , perpetual durance , a restraint , though all the world vastidity you had , to a determined scope .
but in what nature ?
in such a one as , you consenting , would bark your honour from that trunk you bear , and leave you naked .
let me know the point .
o , i do fear thee , claudio , and i quake , lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain , and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour .
darest thou die ?
the sense of death is most in apprehension , and the poor beetle , that we tread upon , in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies .
why give you me this shame ?
think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness ?
if i must die , i will encounter darkness as a bride , and hug it in mine arms .
there spake my brother , there my father grave did utter forth a voice .
yes , thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances .
this deputy , whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i ' the head and follies doth emmew as falcon doth the fowl , is yet a devil his filth within being cast , he would appear a pond as deep as hell .
the prenzie angelo !
o , is the cunning livery of hell , the body to invest and cover in prenzie guards !
dost thou think , claudio ?
if i would yield him my virginity , thou mightst be freed .
o heavens !
it can not be .
yes , he would thee , from this rank offence , so to offend him still .
this night the time that i should do what i abhor to name , or else thou diest .
thou shalt not .
o , were it but my life , throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin .
thanks , dear isabel .
be ready , claudio , for your death tomorrow .
yes .
has he affections in him , that thus can make him bite the law by the nose , when he would force it ?
sure , it is no sin , or of the deadly seven , it is the least .
which is the least ?
if it were damnable , he being so wise , why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fined ?
o isabel !
what says my brother ?
death is a fearful thing .
and shamed life a hateful .
ay , but to die , and go we know not where , to lie in cold obstruction and to rot , this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod , and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods , or to reside in thrilling region of ice , to be imprison in the viewless winds , and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world , or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling is too horrible !
the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age , ache , penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death .
alas , alas !
sweet sister , let me live what sin you do to save a brother life , nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue .
o you beast !
o faithless coward !
o dishonest wretch !
wilt thou be made a man out of my vice ?
not a kind of incest , to take life from thine own sister shame ?
what should i think ?
heaven shield my mother play my father fair !
for such a warped slip of wilderness issued from his blood .
take my defiance !
die , perish !
might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate , it should proceed i pray a thousand prayers for thy death , no word to save thee .
nay , hear me , isabel .
o , fie , fie , fie !
thy sin not accidental , but a trade .
mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd is best thou diest quickly .
o hear me , isabella !
duke vincentio vouchsafe a word , young sister , but one word .
what is your will ?
might you dispense with your leisure , i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit .
i have no superfluous leisure , my stay must be stolen out of other affairs , but i will attend you awhile .
walks apart son , i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister .
angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her , only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures she , having the truth of honour in her , hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive .
i am confessor to angelo , and i know this to be true , therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die , go to your knees and make ready .
let me ask my sister pardon .
i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it .
hold you there farewell .
exit claudio provost , a word with you !
provost what your will , father that now you are come , you will be gone .
leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company .
in good time .
exit provost .
isabella comes forward the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness , but grace , being the soul of your complexion , shall keep the body of it ever fair .
the assault that angelo hath made to you , fortune hath conveyed to my understanding , and , but that frailty hath examples for his falling , i should wonder at angelo .
how will you do to content this substitute , and to save your brother ?
i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born .
but , o , how much is the good duke deceived in angelo !
if ever he return and i can speak to him , i will open my lips in vain , or discover his government .
that shall not be much amiss yet , as the matter now stands , he will avoid your accusation , he made trial of you only .
therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself .
i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit , redeem your brother from the angry law , do no stain to your own gracious person , and much please the absent duke , if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business .
let me hear you speak farther .
i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit .
virtue is bold , and goodness never fearful .
have you not heard speak of mariana , the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea ?
i have heard of the lady , and good words went with her name .
she should this angelo have married , was affianced to her by oath , and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity , her brother frederick was wrecked at sea , having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister .
but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother , in his love toward her ever most kind and natural , with him , the portion and sinew of her fortune , her , with both , her combinate husband , this angelo .
can this be so ?
did angelo so leave her ?
left her in her tears , and dried not one of them with his comfort , swallowed his vows whole , pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few , bestowed her on her own lamentation , which she yet wears for his sake , and he , a marble to her tears , is washed with them , but relents not .
what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world !
what corruption in this life , that it will let this man live !
but how out of this can she avail ?
it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother , but keeps you from dishonour in doing it .
show me how , good father .
this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness , that in all reason should have quenched her love , hath , like an impediment in the current , made it more violent and unruly .
go you to angelo , answer his requiring with a plausible obedience , agree with his demands to the point , only refer yourself to this advantage , first , that your stay with him may not be long , that the time may have all shadow and silence in it , and the place answer to convenience .
this being granted in course , and now follows all , we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment , go in your place , if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter , it may compel him to her recompense and here , by this , is your brother saved , your honour untainted , the poor mariana advantaged , and the corrupt deputy scaled .
the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt .
if you think well to carry this as you may , the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof .
what think you of it ?
the image of it gives me content already , and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection .
it lies much in your holding up .
haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed , give him promise of satisfaction .
i will presently to saint luke there , at the moated grange , resides this dejected mariana .
at that place call upon me , and dispatch with angelo , that it may be quickly .
i thank you for this comfort .
fare you well , good father .
exeunt severally scene ii .
the street before the prison .
enter , on one side , duke vincentio disguised as before , on the other , elbow , and officers with pompey nay , if there be no remedy for it , but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts , we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard .
o heavens !
what stuff is here was never merry world since , of two usuries , the merriest was put down , and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm , and furred with fox and too , to signify , that craft , being richer than innocency , stands for the facing .
come your way , sir .
you , good father friar .
and you , good brother father .
what offence hath this man made you , sir ?
marry , sir , he hath offended the law and , sir , we take him to be a thief too , sir , for we have found upon him , sir , a strange picklock , which we have sent to the deputy .
fie , sirrah !
a bawd , a wicked bawd !
the evil that thou causest to be done , that is thy means to live .
do thou but think what is to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice say to thyself , from their abominable and beastly touches i drink , i eat , array myself , and live .
canst thou believe thy living is a life , so stinkingly depending ?
go mend , go mend .
indeed , it does stink in some sort , sir , but yet , sir , i would prove nay , if the devil have given thee proofs for sin , thou wilt prove his .
take him to prison , officer correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit .
he must before the deputy , sir , he has given him warning the deputy can not abide a whoremaster if he be a whoremonger , and comes before him , he were as good go a mile on his errand .
that we were all , as some would seem to be , from our faults , as faults from seeming , free !
his neck will come to your waist , a cord , sir .
i spy comfort , i cry bail .
here a gentleman and a friend of mine .
enter lucio how now , noble pompey !
what , at the wheels of caesar ?
art thou led in triumph ?
what , is there none of pygmalion images , newly made woman , to be had now , for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch ?
what reply , ha ?
what sayest thou to this tune , matter and method ?
not drowned i ' the last rain , ha ?
what sayest thou , trot ?
is the world as it was , man ?
which is the way ?
is it sad , and few words ?
or how ?
the trick of it ?
still thus , and thus , still worse !
how doth my dear morsel , thy mistress ?
procures she still , ha ?
troth , sir , she hath eaten up all her beef , and she is herself in the tub .
why , is good , it is the right of it , it must be so ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd an unshunned consequence , it must be so .
art going to prison , pompey ?
yes , faith , sir .
why , is not amiss , pompey .
farewell go , say i sent thee thither .
for debt , pompey ?
or how ?
for being a bawd , for being a bawd .
well , then , imprison him if imprisonment be the due of a bawd , why , is his right bawd is he doubtless , and of antiquity too , .
farewell , good pompey .
commend me to the prison , pompey you will turn good husband now , pompey , you will keep the house .
i hope , sir , your good worship will be my bail .
no , indeed , will i not , pompey , it is not the wear .
i will pray , pompey , to increase your bondage if you take it not patiently , why , your mettle is the more .
adieu , trusty pompey .
you , friar .
and you .
does bridget paint still , pompey , ha ?
come your ways , sir , come .
you will not bail me , then , sir ?
then , pompey , nor now .
what news abroad , friar ?
what news ?
come your ways , sir , come .
go to kennel , pompey , go .
exeunt elbow , pompey and officers what news , friar , of the duke ?
i know none .
can you tell me of any ?
some say he is with the emperor of russia , other some , he is in rome but where is he , think you ?
i know not where , but wheresoever , i wish him well .
it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state , and usurp the beggary he was never born to .
lord angelo dukes it well in his absence , he puts transgression to .
he does well in .
a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way , friar .
it is too general a vice , and severity must cure it .
yes , in good sooth , the vice is of a great kindred , it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite , friar , till eating and drinking be put down .
they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true , think you ?
how should he be made , then ?
some report a spawned him , some , that he was begot between two .
but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice , that i know to be true and he is a motion generative , that infallible .
you are pleasant , sir , and speak apace .
why , what a ruthless thing is this in him , for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man !
would the duke that is absent have done this ?
ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards , he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service , and that instructed him to mercy .
i never heard the absent duke much detected for women , he was not inclined that way .
o , sir , you are deceived .
is not possible .
who , not the duke ?
yes , your beggar of fifty , and his use was to put a ducat in her the duke had crotchets in him .
he would be drunk too , that let me inform you .
you do him wrong , surely .
sir , i was an inward of his .
a shy fellow was the duke and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing .
what , i prithee , might be the cause ?
no , pardon , is a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this i can let you understand , the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise .
wise !
why , no question but he was .
a very superficial , ignorant , unweighing fellow .
either this is the envy in you , folly , or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation .
let him be but testimonied in his own , and he shall appear to the envious a scholar , a statesman and a soldier .
therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice .
sir , i know him , and i love him .
love talks with better knowledge , and knowledge with dearer love .
come , sir , i know what i know .
i can hardly believe that , since you know not what you speak .
but , if ever the duke return , as our prayers are he may , let me desire you to make your answer before him .
if it be honest you have spoke , you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you , and , i pray you , your name ?
sir , my name is lucio , well known to the duke .
he shall know you better , sir , if i may live to report you .
i fear you not .
o , you hope the duke will return no more , or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite .
but indeed i can do you little harm , you forswear this again .
i be hanged first thou art deceived in me , friar .
but no more of this .
canst thou tell if claudio die or no ?
why should he die , sir ?
why ?
for filling a bottle with a tundish .
i would the duke we talk of were returned again the ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency , sparrows must not build in his , because they are lecherous .
the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered , he would never bring them to light would he were returned !
marry , this claudio is condemned for untrussing .
farewell , good friar i prithee , pray for me .
the duke , i say to thee again , would eat mutton on fridays .
he not past it yet , and i say to thee , he would mouth with a beggar , though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that i said so .
farewell .

but who comes here ?
enter escalus , provost , and officers with mistress overdone go , away with her to prison !
good my lord , be good to me , your honour is accounted a merciful man , good my lord .
double and treble admonition , and still forfeit in the same kind !
this would make mercy swear and play the tyrant .
a bawd of eleven years ' continuance , may it please your honour .
my lord , this is one lucio information against me .
mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the duke time , he promised her marriage his child is a year and a quarter old , come philip and jacob i have kept it myself , and see how he goes about to abuse me !
that fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be called before us .
away with her to prison !
go to , no more words .
exeunt officers with mistress overdone provost , my brother angelo will not be altered , claudio must die let him be furnished with divines , and have all charitable preparation .
if my brother wrought by my pity , it should not be so with him .
so please you , this friar hath been with him , and advised him for the entertainment of death .
good even , good father .
bliss and goodness on you !
of whence are you ?
not of this country , though my chance is now to use it for my time i am a brother of gracious order , late come from the see in special business from his holiness .
what news abroad i ' the world ?
none , but that there is so great a fever on goodness , that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request , and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course , as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking .
there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure , but security enough to make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world .
this news is old enough , yet it is every day news .
i pray you , sir , of what disposition was the duke ?
one that , above all other strifes , contended especially to know himself .
what pleasure was he given to ?
rather rejoicing to see another merry , than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance .
but leave we him to his events , with a prayer they may prove prosperous , and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepared .
i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation .
he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge , but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself , by the instruction of his frailty , many deceiving promises of life , which i by my good leisure have discredited to him , and now is he resolved to die .
you have paid the heavens your function , and the prisoner the very debt of your calling .
i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i found so severe , that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed justice .
if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding , it shall become him well , wherein if he chance to fail , he hath sentenced himself .
i am going to visit the prisoner .
fare you well .
peace be with you !
exeunt escalus and provost he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe , pattern in himself to know , grace to stand , and virtue go , more nor less to others paying than by weighing .
shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking !
twice treble shame on angelo , to weed my vice and let his grow !
o , what may man within him hide , though angel on the outward side !
how may likeness made in crimes , making practise on the times , to draw with idle spiders ' strings most ponderous and substantial things !
craft against vice i must apply with angelo shall lie his old betrothed but despised , so disguise shall , by the disguised , pay with falsehood false exacting , and perform an old contracting .

but shall you on your knowledge find this way ?
i have a due and wary note upo with whispering and most guilty diligence , in action all of precept , he did show me the way twice .
are there no other tokens between you concerning her observance ?
no , none , but only a repair i ' the dark , and that i have possess him my most stay can be but brief , for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along , that stays upon me , whose persuasion is i come about my brother .
is well borne up .
i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this .
what , ho !

come forth !
mariana i pray you , be acquainted with this maid , she comes to do you good .
i do desire the like .
do you persuade yourself that i respect you ?
good friar , i know you do , and have found it .

i shall attend your leisure but make haste , the vaporous night approaches .

she take the enterprise upon her , father , if you advise it .
it is not my consent , but my entreaty too .
little have you to say when you depart from him , but , soft and low , now my brother . '
fear me not .

come , sir , leave me your snatches , and yield me a direct answer .
morning are to die claudio and barnardine .
here is in our prison a common executioner , who in his office lacks a helper if you will take it on you to assist him , it shall redeem you from your gyves , if not , you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping , for you have been a notorious bawd .
sir , i have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind , but yet i will be content to be a lawful hangman .
i would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow partner .
what , ho !
abhorson !
where abhorson , there ?
enter abhorson do you call , sir ?
sirrah , here a fellow will help you in your execution .
if you think it meet , compound with him by the year , and let him abide here with you , if not , use him for the present and dismiss him .
he can not plead his estimation with you , he hath been a bawd .
a bawd , sir ?
fie upon him !
he will discredit our mystery .
go to , sir , you weigh equally , a feather will turn the scale .
exit pray , sir , by your good favour , for surely , sir , a good favour you have , but that you have a hanging look , do you call , sir , your occupation a mystery ?
ay , sir , a mystery painting , sir , i have heard say , is a mystery , and your whores , sir , being members of my occupation , using painting , do prove my occupation a mystery but what mystery there should be in hanging , if i should be hanged , i can not imagine .
sir , it is a mystery .
proof ?
every true man apparel fits your thief if it be too little for your thief , your true man thinks it big enough , if it be too big for your thief , your thief thinks it little enough so every true man apparel fits your thief .
provost are you agreed ?
sir , i will serve him , for i do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd , he doth oftener ask forgiveness .
you , sirrah , provide your block and your axe four .
come on , bawd , i will instruct thee in my trade , follow .
i do desire to learn , sir and i hope , if you have occasion to use me for your own turn , you shall find me yare , for truly , sir , for your kindness i owe you a good turn .

what comfort is for claudio ?
there some in hope .
it is a bitter deputy .
not so , not so , his life is parallel even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he meal with that which he corrects , then were he tyrannous , but this being so , he just .

giving a paper my lord hath sent you this note , and by me this further charge , that you swerve not from the smallest article of it , neither in time , matter , or other circumstance .
good morrow , for , as i take it , it is almost day .
i shall obey him .
exit messenger aside this is his pardon , purchased by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in .
hence hath offence his quick celerity , when it is born in high authority when vice makes mercy , mercy so extended , that for the fault love is the offender friended .
now , sir , what news ?
i told you .
lord angelo , belike thinking me remiss in mine office , awakens me with this unwonted , methinks strangely , for he hath not used it before .
pray you , let hear .
reads you may hear to the contrary , let claudio be executed by four of the clock , and in the afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction , let me have claudio head sent me by five .
let this be duly performed , with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver .
thus fail not to do your office , as you will answer it at your peril . '
what say you to this , sir ?
what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon ?
a bohemian born , but here nursed un and bred , one that is a prisoner nine years old .
how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him ?
i have heard it was ever his manner to do so .
his friends still wrought reprieves for him and , indeed , his fact , till now in the government of lord angelo , came not to an undoubtful proof .
it is now apparent ?
most manifest , and not denied by himself .
hath he born himself penitently in prison ?
how seems he to be touched ?
a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep , careless , reckless , and fearless of what past , present , or to come , insensible of mortality , and desperately mortal .
he wants advice .
he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison , give him leave to escape hence , he would not drunk many times a day , if not many days entirely drunk .
we have very oft awaked him , as if to carry him to execution , and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all .
more of him anon .
there is written in your brow , provost , honesty and constancy if i read it not truly , my ancient skill beguiles me , but , in the boldness of my cunning , i will lay myself in hazard .
claudio , whom here you have warrant to execute , is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him .
to make you understand this in a manifested effect , i crave but four days ' respite , for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy .
pray , sir , in what ?
in the delaying death .
a lack , how may i do it , having the hour limited , and an express command , under penalty , to deliver his head in the view of angelo ?
i may make my case as claudio , to cross this in the smallest .
by the vow of mine order i warrant you , if my instructions may be your guide .
let this barnardine be this morning executed , and his head born to angelo .
angelo hath seen them both , and will discover the favour .
o , death a great disguiser , and you may add to it .
shave the head , and tie the beard , and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common .
if any thing fall to you upon this , more than thanks and good fortune , by the saint whom i profess , i will plead against it with my life .
pardon me , good father , it is against my oath .
were you sworn to the duke , or to the deputy ?
to him , and to his substitutes .
you will think you have made no offence , if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing ?
but what likelihood is in that ?
not a resemblance , but a certainty .
yet since i see you fearful , that neither my coat , integrity , nor persuasion can with ease attempt you , i will go further than i meant , to pluck all fears out of you .
look you , sir , here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character , i doubt not , and the signet is not strange to you .
i know them both .
the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon it at your pleasure , where you shall find , within these two days he will be here .
this is a thing that angelo knows not , for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor , perchance of the duke death , perchance entering into some monastery , but , by chance , nothing of what is writ .
look , the unfolding star calls up the shepherd .
put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known .
call your executioner , and off with barnardine head i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place .
yet you are amazed , but this shall absolutely resolve you .
come away , it is almost clear dawn .
exeunt scene iii .
another room in the same .

exit unfit to live or die o gravel heart !
after him , fellows , bring him to the block .
exeunt abhorson and pompey provost now , sir , how do you find the prisoner ?
a creature unprepared , unmeet for death , and to transport him in the mind he is were damnable .
here in the prison , father , there died this morning of a cruel fever one ragozine , a most notorious pirate , a man of claudio years , his beard and head just of his colour .
what if we do omit this reprobate till he were well inclined , and satisfy the deputy with the visage of ragozine , more like to claudio ?
o , is an accident that heaven provides !
dispatch it presently , the hour draws on prefix by angelo see this be done , and sent according to command , whiles i persuade this rude wretch willingly to die .
this shall be done , good father , presently .
but barnardine must die this afternoon and how shall we continue claudio , to save me from the danger that might come if he were known alive ?
let this be done .
put them in secret holds , both barnardine and claudio ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting to the under generation , you shall find your safety manifested .
i am your free dependant .
quick , dispatch , and send the head to angelo .
exit provost now will i write letters to angelo , the provost , he shall bear them , whose contents shall witness to him i am near at home , and that , by great injunctions , i am bound to enter publicly him i desire to meet me at the consecrated fount a league below the city , and from thence , by cold gradation and form , we shall proceed with angelo .
provost here is the head , i carry it myself .
convenient is it .
make a swift return , for i would commune with you of such things that want no ear but yours .
i make all speed .
exit within peace , ho , be here !
the tongue of isabel .
she come to know if yet her brother pardon be come hither but i will keep her ignorant of her good , to make her heavenly comforts of despair , when it is least expected .
enter isabella ho , by your leave !
good morning to you , fair and gracious daughter .
the better , given me by so holy a man .
hath yet the deputy sent my brother pardon ?
he hath released him , isabel , from the world his head is off and sent to angelo .
nay , but it is not so .
it is no other show your wisdom , daughter , in your close patience .
o , i will to him and pluck out his eyes !
you shall not be admitted to his sight .
unhappy claudio !
wretched isabel !
injurious world !
most damned angelo !
this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot , forbear it therefore , give your cause to heaven .
mark what i say , which you shall find by every syllable a faithful verity the duke comes home , nay , dry your eyes , one of our convent , and his confessor , gives me this instance already he hath carried notice to escalus and angelo , who do prepare to meet him at the gates , there to give up their power .
if you can , pace your wisdom in that good path that i would wish it go , and you shall have your bosom on this wretch , grace of the duke , revenges to your heart , and general honour .
i am directed by you .
this letter , then , to friar peter give , is that he sent me of the duke return say , by this token , i desire his company at mariana house .
her cause and yours i perfect him withal , and he shall bring you before the duke , and to the head of angelo accuse him home and home .
for my poor self , i am combined by a sacred vow and shall be absent .
wend you with this letter command these fretting waters from your eyes with a light heart , trust not my holy order , if i pervert your course .
who here ?
enter lucio good even .
friar , where the provost ?
not within , sir .
o pretty isabella , i am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red thou must be patient .
i am fain to dine and sup with water and bran , i dare not for my head fill my belly , one fruitful meal would set me to .
but they say the duke will be here .
by my troth , isabel , i loved thy brother if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home , he had lived .
exit isabella sir , the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports , but the best is , he lives not in them .
friar , thou knowest not the duke so well as i do he a better woodman than thou takest him for .
well , you answer this one day .
fare ye well .
nay , tarry , i go along with thee i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke .
you have told me too many of him already , sir , if they be true , if not true , none were enough .
i was once before him for getting a wench with child .
did you such a thing ?
yes , marry , did i but i was fain to forswear it , they would else have married me to the rotten medlar .
sir , your company is fairer than honest .
rest you well .
by my troth , i go with thee to the lane end if bawdy talk offend you , we have very little of it .
nay , friar , i am a kind of burr , i shall stick .
exeunt scene iv .
a room in angelo house .
enter angelo and escalus every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other .
in most uneven and distracted manner .
his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted !
and why meet him at the gates , and redeliver our authorities there i guess not .
and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering , that if any crave redress of injustice , they should exhibit their petitions in the street ?
he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints , and to deliver us from devices hereafter , which shall then have no power to stand against us .
well , i beseech you , let it be proclaimed betimes i ' the morn , i call you at your house give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him .
i shall , sir .
fare you well .
good night .
exit escalus this deed unshapes me quite , makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings .
a deflower maid !
and by an eminent body that enforced the law against it !
but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss , how might she tongue me !
yet reason dares her no , for my authority bears of a credent bulk , that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather .
he should have lived , save that riotous youth , with dangerous sense , might in the times to come have revenge , by so receiving a dishonour life with ransom of such shame .
would yet he had lived !
a lack , when once our grace we have forgot , nothing goes right we would , and we would not .
exit scene fields without the town .
enter duke vincentio in his own habit , and friar peter these letters at fit time deliver me giving letters the provost knows our purpose and our plot .
the matter being afoot , keep your instruction , and hold you ever to our special drift , though sometimes you do blench from this to that , as cause doth minister .
go call at flavius ' house , and tell him where i stay give the like notice to valentinus , rowland , and to crassus , and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate , but send me flavius first .
it shall be speeded well .
exit enter varrius i thank thee , varrius , thou hast made good haste come , we will walk .
there other of our friends will greet us here anon , my gentle varrius .
exeunt scene vi .
street near the city gate .
enter isabella and mariana to speak so indirectly i am loath i would say the truth , but to accuse him so , that is your part yet i am advised to do it , he says , to veil full purpose .
be ruled by him .
besides , he tells me that , if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side , i should not think it strange , for is a physic that bitter to sweet end .
i would friar peter o , peace !
the friar is come .
enter friar peter come , i have found you out a stand most fit , where you may have such vantage on the duke , he shall not pass you .
twice have the trumpets sounded , the generous and gravest citizens have hent the gates , and very near upon the duke is entering therefore , hence , away !
exeunt act v scene i .
the city gate .
mariana veiled , isabella , and friar peter , at their stand .
enter duke vincentio , varrius , lords , angelo , escalus , lucio , provost , officers , and citizens , at several doors my very worthy cousin , fairly met !
our old and faithful friend , we are glad to see you .
happy return be to your royal grace !
many and hearty thankings to you both .
we have made inquiry of you , and we hear such goodness of your justice , that our soul can not but yield you forth to public thanks , forerunning more requital .
you make my bonds still greater .
o , your desert speaks loud , and i should wrong it , to lock it in the wards of covert bosom , when it deserves , with characters of brass , a forted residence the tooth of time and razure of oblivion .
give me your hand , and let the subject see , to make them know that outward courtesies would fain proclaim favours that keep within .
come , escalus , you must walk by us on our other hand , and good supporters are you .
friar peter and isabella come forward now is your time speak loud and kneel before him .
justice , o royal duke !
vail your regard upon a wrong , i would fain have said , a maid !
o worthy prince , dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice , justice , justice , justice !
relate your wrongs , in what ?
by whom ?
be brief .
here is lord angelo shall give you justice reveal yourself to him .
o worthy duke , you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself , for that which i must speak must either punish me , not being believed , or wring redress from you .
hear me , o hear me , here !
my lord , her wits , i fear me , are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice , by course of justice !
and she will speak most bitterly and strange .
most strange , but yet most truly , will i speak that angelo forsworn , is it not strange ?
that angelo a murderer , is not strange ?
that angelo is an adulterous thief , an hypocrite , a , is it not strange and strange ?
nay , it is ten times strange .
it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay , it is ten times true , for truth is truth to the end of reckoning .
away with her !
poor soul , she speaks this in the infirmity of sense .
o prince , i conjure thee , as thou believest there is another comfort than this world , that thou neglect me not , with that opinion that i am touch with madness !
make not impossible that which but seems unlike is not impossible but one , the caitiff on the ground , may seem as shy , as grave , as just , as absolute as angelo , even so may angelo , in all his dressings , characts , titles , forms , be an , believe it , royal prince if he be less , he nothing , but he more , had i more name for badness .
by mine honesty , if she be mad , as i believe no other , her madness hath the oddest frame of sense , such a dependency of thing on thing , as i heard in madness .
o gracious duke , harp not on that , nor do not banish reason for inequality , but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid , and hide the false seems true .
many that are not mad have , sure , more lack of reason .
what would you say ?
i am the sister of one claudio , condemn upon the act of fornication to lose his head , condemn by angelo i , in probation of a sisterhood , was sent to by my brother , one lucio as then the messenger , that i , a like your grace i came to her from claudio , and desired her to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo for her poor brother pardon .
that he indeed .
you were not bid to speak .
no , my good lord , nor wish to hold my peace .
i wish you now , then , pray you , take note of it and when you have a business for yourself , pray heaven you then be perfect .
i warrant your honour .
the warrants for yourself , take heed .
this gentleman told somewhat of my tale , right .
it may be right , but you are i ' the wrong to speak before your time .
proceed .
i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy , that somewhat madly spoken .
pardon it , the phrase is to the matter .
mended again .
the matter , proceed .
in brief , to set the needless process by , how i persuaded , how i pray , and kneel , how he refell me , and how i replied , for this was of much length , the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not , but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust , release my brother , and , after much debatement , my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour , and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes , his purpose surfeiting , he sends a warrant for my poor brother head .
this is most likely !
o , that it were as like as it is true !
by heaven , fond wretch , thou knowist not what thou , or else thou art suborn against his honour in hateful practise .
first , his integrity stands without blemish .
next , it imports no reason that with such vehemency he should pursue faults proper to himself if he had so offended , he would have weigh thy brother by himself and not have cut him off .
some one hath set you on confess the truth , and say by whose advice thou camest here to complain .
and is this all ?
then , o you blessed ministers above , keep me in patience , and with ripen time unfold the evil which is here wrapt up in countenance !
heaven shield your grace from woe , as i , thus wrong , hence unbelieved go !
i know fain be gone .
an officer !
to prison with her !
shall we thus permit a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall on him so near us ?
this needs must be a practise .
who knew of your intent and coming hither ?
one that i would were here , friar lodowick .
a ghostly father , belike .
who knows that lodowick ?
my lord , i know him , is a meddling friar , i do not like the man had he been lay , my lord for certain words he spake against your grace in your retirement , i had swinged him soundly .
words against me ?
this is a good friar , belike !
and to set on this wretched woman here against our substitute !
let this friar be found .
but yesternight , my lord , she and that friar , i saw them at the prison a saucy friar , a very scurvy fellow .
blessed be your royal grace !
i have stood by , my lord , and i have heard your royal ear abused .
first , hath this woman most wrongfully accused your substitute , who is as free from touch or soil with her as she from one ungot .
we did believe no less .
know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of ?
i know him for a man divine and holy , not scurvy , nor a temporary meddler , as he reported by this gentleman , and , on my trust , a man that never yet did , as he vouches , misreport your grace .
my lord , most villanously , believe it .
well , he in time may come to clear himself , but at this instant he is sick my lord , of a strange fever .
upon his mere request , being come to knowledge that there was complaint intended lord angelo , came i hither , to speak , as from his mouth , what he doth know is true and false , and what he with his oath and all probation will make up full clear , whensoever he convented .
first , for this woman .
to justify this worthy nobleman , so vulgarly and personally accused , her shall you hear disproved to her eyes , till she herself confess it .
good friar , let hear it .
isabella is carried off guarded , and mariana comes forward do you not smile at this , lord angelo ?
o heaven , the vanity of wretched fools !
give us some seats .
come , cousin angelo , in this i be impartial , be you judge of your own cause .
is this the witness , friar ?
first , let her show her face , and after speak .
pardon , my lord , i will not show my face until my husband bid me .
what , are you married ?
no , my lord .
are you a maid ?
no , my lord .
a widow , then ?
neither , my lord .
why , you are nothing then neither maid , widow , nor wife ?
my lord , she may be a punk , for many of them are neither maid , widow , nor wife .
silence that fellow i would he had some cause to prattle for himself .
well , my lord .
my lord , i do confess i was married , and i confess besides i am no maid i have known my husband , yet my husband knows not that ever he knew me .
he was drunk then , my lord it can be no better .
for the benefit of silence , would thou wert so too !
well , my lord .
this is no witness for lord angelo .
now i come my lord she that accuses him of fornication , in manner doth accuse my husband , and charges him my lord , with such a time when i depose i had him in mine arms with all the effect of love .
charges she more than me ?
not that i know .
no ?
you say your husband .
why , just , my lord , and that is angelo , who thinks he knows that he knew my body , but knows he thinks that he knows isabel .
this is a strange abuse .
let see thy face .
my husband bids me , now i will unmask .
unveiling this is that face , thou cruel angelo , which once thou sworest was worth the looking on , this is the hand which , with a vow contract , was fast belock in thine , this is the body that took away the match from isabel , and did supply thee at thy in her imagined person .
know you this woman ?
carnally , she says .
sirrah , no more !
enough , my lord .
my lord , i must confess i know this woman and five years since there was some speech of marriage betwixt myself and her , which was broke off , partly for that her promised proportions came short of composition , but in chief for that her reputation was disvalued in levity since which time of five years i never spake with her , saw her , nor heard from her , upon my faith and honour .
noble prince , as there comes light from heaven and words from breath , as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue , i am affianced this man wife as strongly as words could make up vows and , my good lord , but tuesday night last gone in he knew me as a wife .
as this is true , let me in safety raise me from my knees or else for ever be confixed here , a marble monument !
i did but smile till now now , good my lord , give me the scope of justice my patience here is touch .
i do perceive these poor informal women are no more but instruments of some more mightier member that sets them on let me have way , my lord , to find this practise out .
ay , with my heart and punish them to your height of pleasure .
thou foolish friar , and thou pernicious woman , compact with her that gone , thou thy oaths , though they would swear down each particular saint , were testimonies against his worth and credit that seal in approbation ?
you , lord escalus , sit with my cousin , lend him your kind pains to find out this abuse , whence is derived .
there is another friar that set them on , let him be sent for .
would he were here , my lord !
for he indeed hath set the women on to this complaint your provost knows the place where he abides and he may fetch him .
go do it instantly .
exit provost and you , my noble and cousin , whom it concerns to hear this matter forth , do with your injuries as seems you best , in any chastisement i for a while will leave you , but stir not you till you have well determined upon these slanderers .
my lord , we do it throughly .
exit duke signior lucio , did not you say you knew that friar lodowick to be a dishonest person ?
non facit monachum ' honest in nothing but in his clothes , and one that hath spoke most villanous speeches of the duke .
we shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him we shall find this friar a notable fellow .
as any in vienna , on my word .
call that same isabel here once again , i would speak with her .
exit an attendant pray you , my lord , give me leave to question , you shall see how i handle her .
not better than he , by her own report .
say you ?
marry , sir , i think , if you handled her privately , she would sooner confess perchance , publicly , she be ashamed .
i will go darkly to work with her .
that the way , for women are light at midnight .
officers with isabella , and provost with the duke vincentio in his friar habit come on , mistress here a gentlewoman denies all that you have said .
my lord , here comes the rascal i spoke of , here with the provost .
in very good time speak not you to him till we call upon you .
mum .
come , sir did you set these women on to slander lord angelo ?
they have confessed you did .
is false .
how !
know you where you are ?
respect to your great place !
and let the devil be sometime honour for his burning throne !
where is the duke ?
is he should hear me speak .
the duke in us , and we will hear you speak look you speak justly .
boldly , at least .
but , o , poor souls , come you to seek the lamb here of the fox ?
good night to your redress !
is the duke gone ?
then is your cause gone too .
the duke unjust , thus to retort your manifest appeal , and put your trial in the villain mouth which here you come to accuse .
this is the rascal , this is he i spoke of .
why , thou unreverend and unhallow friar , not enough thou hast suborn these women to accuse this worthy man , but , in foul mouth and in the witness of his proper ear , to call him villain ?
and then to glance from him to the duke himself , to tax him with injustice ?
take him hence , to the rack with him !
we touse you joint by joint , but we will know his purpose .
what ' !
be not so hot , the duke dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he dare rack his own his subject am i not , nor here provincial .
my business in this state made me a looker on here in vienna , where i have seen corruption boil and bubble till it the stew , laws for all faults , but faults so countenanced , that the strong statutes stand like the forfeits in a barber shop , as much in mock as mark .
slander to the state !
away with him to prison !
what can you vouch against him , signior lucio ?
is this the man that you did tell us of ?
is he , my lord .
come hither , goodman baldpate do you know me ?
i remember you , sir , by the sound of your voice i met you at the prison , in the absence of the duke .
o , did you so ?
and do you remember what you said of the duke ?
most notedly , sir .
do you so , sir ?
and was the duke a fleshmonger , a fool , and a coward , as you then reported him to be ?
you must , sir , change persons with me , ere you make that my report you , indeed , spoke so of him , and much more , much worse .
o thou damnable fellow !
did not i pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches ?
i protest i love the duke as i love myself .
hark , how the villain would close now , after his treasonable abuses !
such a fellow is not to be talked withal .
away with him to prison !
where is the provost ?
away with him to prison !
lay bolts enough upon him let him speak no more .
away with those giglots too , and with the other confederate companion !
to provost stay , sir , stay awhile .
what , resists he ?
help him , lucio .
come , sir , come , sir , come , sir , foh , sir !
why , you , lying rascal , you must be hooded , must you ?
show your knave visage , with a pox to you !
show your face , and be hanged an hour !
not off ?
pulls off the friar hood , and discovers duke vincentio thou art the first knave that madest a duke .
first , provost , let me bail these gentle three .
to lucio sneak not away , sir , for the friar and you must have a word anon .
lay hold on him .
this may prove worse than hanging .
to escalus what you have spoke i pardon sit you down we borrow place of him .
to angelo sir , by your leave .
hast thou or word , or wit , or impudence , that yet can do thee office ?
if thou hast , rely upon it till my tale be heard , and hold no longer out .
o my dread lord , i should be guiltier than my guiltiness , to think i can be undiscernible , when i perceive your grace , like power divine , hath look upon my passes .
then , good prince , no longer session hold upon my shame , but let my trial be mine own confession immediate sentence then and sequent death is all the grace i beg .
come hither , mariana .
say , wast thou contracted to this woman ?
i was , my lord .
go take her hence , and marry her instantly .
do you the office , friar , which consummate , return him here again .
go with him , provost .
exeunt angelo , mariana , friar peter and provost my lord , i am more amazed at his dishonour than at the strangeness of it .
come hither , isabel .
your friar is now your prince as i was then advertising and holy to your business , not changing heart with habit , i am still attorney at your service .
o , give me pardon , that i , your vassal , have employ and pain your unknown sovereignty !
you are pardon , isabel and now , dear maid , be you as free to us .
your brother death , i know , sits at your heart , and you may marvel why i obscured myself , labouring to save his life , and would not rather make rash remonstrance of my hidden power than let him so be lost .
o most kind maid , it was the swift celerity of his death , which i did think with slower foot came on , that brain my purpose .
but , peace be with him !
that life is better life , past fearing death , than that which lives to fear make it your comfort , so happy is your brother .
i do , my lord .
angelo , mariana , friar peter , and provost for this man approaching here , whose salt imagination yet hath wrong your well defended honour , you must pardon for mariana sake but as he adjudged your brother , being criminal , in double violation of sacred chastity and of thereon dependent , for your brother life , the very mercy of the law cries out most audible , even from his proper tongue , angelo for claudio , death for death ! '
haste still pays haste , and leisure answers leisure , like doth quit like , and measure still for measure .
then , angelo , thy fault thus manifested , which , though thou wouldst deny , denies thee vantage .
we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stoop to death , and with like haste .
away with him !
o my most gracious lord , i hope you will not mock me with a husband .
it is your husband mock you with a husband .
consenting to the safeguard of your honour , i thought your marriage fit , else imputation , for that he knew you , might reproach your life and choke your good to come , for his possessions , although by confiscation they are ours , we do instate and widow you withal , to buy you a better husband .
o my dear lord , i crave no other , nor no better man .
never crave him , we are definitive .
gentle my liege , kneeling you do but lose your labour .
away with him to death !
to lucio now , sir , to you .
o my good lord !
sweet isabel , take my part , lend me your knees , and all my life to come i lend you all my life to do you service .
against all sense you do importune her should she kneel down in mercy of this fact , her brother ghost his paved bed would break , and take her hence in horror .
isabel , sweet isabel , do yet but kneel by me , hold up your hands , say nothing , i speak all .
they say , best men are moulded out of faults , and , for the most , become much more the better for being a little bad so may my husband .
o isabel , will you not lend a knee ?
he dies for claudio death .
most bounteous sir , kneeling look , if it please you , on this man condemn , as if my brother lived i partly think a due sincerity govern his deeds , till he did look on me since it is so , let him not die .
my brother had but justice , in that he did the thing for which he died for angelo , his act did not his bad intent , and must be buried but as an intent that perish by the way thoughts are no subjects , intents but merely thoughts .
merely , my lord .
your suit unprofitable , stand up , i say .
i have bethought me of another fault .
provost , how came it claudio was beheaded at an unusual hour ?
it was commanded so .
had you a special warrant for the deed ?
no , my good lord , it was by private message .
for which i do discharge you of your office give up your keys .
pardon me , noble lord i thought it was a fault , but knew it not , yet did repent me , after more advice , for testimony whereof , one in the prison , that should by private order else have died , i have reserved alive .
what he ?
his name is barnardine .
i would thou hadst done so by claudio .
go fetch him hither , let me look upon him .
exit provost i am sorry , one so learned and so wise as you , lord angelo , have still appear , should slip so grossly , both in the heat of blood .
and lack of temper judgment afterward .
i am sorry that such sorrow i procure and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart that i crave death more willingly than mercy , is my deserving , and i do entreat it .
provost , with barnardine , claudio muffled , and juliet which is that barnardine ?
this , my lord .
there was a friar told me of this man .
sirrah , thou art said to have a stubborn soul .
that apprehends no further than this world , and squarest thy life according .
condemn but , for those earthly faults , i quit them all , and pray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to come .
friar , advise him , i leave him to your hand .
what muffled fellow that ?
this is another prisoner that i saved .
who should have died when claudio lost his head , as like almost to claudio as himself .
unmuffles claudio to isabella if he be like your brother , for his sake is he pardon , and , for your lovely sake , give me your hand and say you will be mine .
he is my brother too but fitter time for that .
by this lord angelo perceives he safe , methinks i see a quickening in his eye .
well , angelo , your evil quits you well look that you love your wife , her worth worth yours .
i find an apt remission in myself , and yet here one in place i can not pardon .
to lucio you , sirrah , that knew me for a fool , a coward , one all of luxury , an ass , a madman , wherein have i so deserved of you , that you extol me thus ?
, my lord .
i spoke it but according to the trick .
if you will hang me for it , you may , but i had rather it would please you i might be whipt .
whipt first , sir , and hanged after .
proclaim it , provost , round about the city .
is any woman wrong by this lewd fellow , as i have heard him swear himself there one whom he begot with child , let her appear , and he shall marry her the nuptial finish , let him be whipt and hang .
i beseech your highness , do not marry me to a whore .
your highness said even now , i made you a duke good my lord , do not recompense me in making me a cuckold .
upon mine honour , thou shalt marry her .
thy slanders i forgive , and therewithal remit thy other forfeits .
take him to prison , and see our pleasure herein executed .
marrying a punk , my lord , is pressing to death , whipping , and hanging .
slandering a prince deserves it .
exit officers with lucio she , claudio , that you wrong , look you restore .
joy to you , mariana !
love her , angelo i have confess her and i know her virtue .
thanks , good friend escalus , for thy much goodness there more behind that is more gratulate .
thanks , provost , for thy care and secrecy we shill employ thee in a worthier place .
forgive him , angelo , that brought you home the head of ragozine for claudio the offence pardons itself .
dear isabel , i have a motion much imports your good , whereto if you a willing ear incline , what mine is yours and what is yours is mine .
so , bring us to our palace , where we show what yet behind , that meet you all should know .
exeunt act i scene venice .
a street .
enter antonio , salarino , and salanio in sooth , i know not why i am so sad it wearies me , you say it wearies you , but how i caught it , found it , or came by it , what stuff is made of , whereof it is born , i am to learn , and such a sadness makes of me , that i have much ado to know myself .
your mind is tossing on the ocean , there , where your argosies with portly sail , like signiors and rich burghers on the flood , or , as it were , the pageants of the sea , do overpeer the petty traffickers , that curtsy to them , do them reverence , as they fly by them with their woven wings .
believe me , sir , had i such venture forth , the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad .
i should be still plucking the grass , to know where sits the wind , peering in maps for ports and piers and roads , and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures , out of doubt would make me sad .
my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague , when i thought what harm a wind too great at sea might do .
i should not see the sandy run , but i should think of shallows and of flats , and see my wealthy andrew dock in sand , vailing her lower than her ribs to kiss her burial .
should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone , and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks , which touching but my gentle vessel side , would scatter all her spices on the stream , enrobe the roaring waters with my silks , and , in a word , but even now worth this , and now worth nothing ?
shall i have the thought to think on this , and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanced would make me sad ?
but tell not me , i know , antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise .
believe me , no i thank my fortune for it , my ventures are not in one bottom trusted , nor to one place , nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .
why , then you are in love .
fie , fie !
not in love neither ?
then let us say you are sad , because you are not merry and as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry , because you are not sad .
now , by janus , nature hath framed strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a , and other of such vinegar aspect that they not show their teeth in way of smile , though nestor swear the jest be laughable .
enter bassanio , lorenzo , and gratiano here comes bassanio , your most noble kinsman , gratiano and lorenzo .
fare ye well we leave you now with better company .
i would have stay till i had made you merry , if worthier friends had not prevented me .
your worth is very dear in my regard .
i take it , your own business calls on you and you embrace the occasion to depart .
good morrow , my good lords .
good signiors both , when shall we laugh ?
say , when ?
you grow exceeding strange must it be so ?
we make our leisures to attend on yours .
exeunt salarino and salanio my lord bassanio , since you have found antonio , we two will leave you but at , i pray you , have in mind where we must meet .
i will not fail you .
you look not well , signior antonio , you have too much respect upon the world they lose it that do buy it with much care believe me , you are marvellously changed .
i hold the world but as the world , gratiano , a stage where every man must play a part , and mine a sad one .
let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come , and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans .
why should a man , whose blood is warm within , sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster ?
sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish ?
i tell thee what , antonio i love thee , and it is my love that speaks there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pond , and do a wilful stillness entertain , with purpose to be dress in an opinion of wisdom , gravity , profound conceit , as who should say ' i am sir oracle , and when i ope my lips let no dog bark ! '
o my antonio , i do know of these that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing , when , i am very sure , if they should speak , would almost damn those ears , which , hearing them , would call their brothers fools .
i tell thee more of this another time but fish not , with this melancholy bait , for this fool gudgeon , this opinion .
come , good lorenzo .
fare ye well awhile i end my exhortation after dinner .
well , we will leave you then till i must be one of these same dumb wise men , for gratiano never lets me speak .
well , keep me company but two years moe , thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue .
farewell i grow a talker for this gear .
thanks , i ' faith , for silence is only commendable in a neat tongue dried and a maid not vendible .
exeunt gratiano and lorenzo is that any thing now ?
gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing , more than any man in all venice .
his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them , and when you have them , they are not worth the search .
well , tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage , that you promised to tell me of ?
is not unknown to you , antonio , how much i have disabled mine estate , by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate , but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gaged .
to you , antonio , i owe the most , in money and in love , and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe .
i pray you , good bassanio , let me know it , and if it stand , as you yourself still do , within the eye of honour , be assured , my purse , my person , my extremest means , lie all unlock to your occasions .
in my , when i had lost one shaft , i shot his fellow of the flight the way with more advised watch , to find the other forth , and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof , because what follows is pure innocence .
i owe you much , and , like a wilful youth , that which i owe is lost , but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first , i do not doubt , as i will watch the aim , or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first .
you know me well , and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance , and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done , and i am prest unto it therefore , speak .
in belmont is a lady richly left , and she is fair , and , fairer than that word , of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia , nothing undervalued to cato daughter , brutus ' portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth , for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors , and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece , which makes her seat of belmont colchos ' strand , and many jasons come in quest of her .
o my antonio , had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them , i have a mind presages me such thrift , that i should questionless be fortunate !
thou that all my fortunes are at sea , neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth , try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rack , even to the uttermost , to furnish thee to belmont , to fair portia .
go , presently inquire , and so will i , where money is , and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake .
exeunt scene ii belmont .
a room in portia house .
enter portia and nerissa by my troth , nerissa , my little body is aweary of this great world .
you would be , sweet madam , if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet , for aught i see , they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing .
it is no mean happiness therefore , to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs , but competency lives longer .
good sentences and well pronounced .
they would be better , if well followed .
if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do , chapels had been churches and poor men cottages princes ' palaces .
it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done , than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching .
the brain may devise laws for the blood , but a hot temper leaps a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth , to skip the meshes of good counsel the cripple .
but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband .
o me , the word ! '
i may neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i dislike , so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father .
is it not hard , nerissa , that i can not choose one nor refuse none ?
your father was ever virtuous , and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottery , that he hath devised in these three chests of gold , silver and lead , whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you , will , no doubt , never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love .
but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come ?
i pray thee , them , and as thou namest them , i will describe them , and , according to my description , level at my affection .
first , there is the neapolitan prince .
ay , that a colt indeed , for he doth nothing but talk of his horse , and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts , that he can shoe him himself .
i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith .
then there is the county palatine .
he doth nothing but frown , as who should say you will not have me , choose ' he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth .
i had rather be married to a with a bone in his mouth than to either of these .
god defend me from these two !
how say you by the french lord , monsieur le bon ?
god made him , and therefore let him pass for a man .
in truth , i know it is a sin to be a mocker but , he !
why , he hath a horse better than the neapolitan , a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine , he is every man in no man , if a throstle sing , he falls straight a capering he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him , i should marry twenty husbands .
if he would despise me i would forgive him , for if he love me to madness , i shall never requite him .
what say you , then , to falconbridge , the young baron of england ?
you know i say nothing to him , for he understands not me , nor i him he hath neither latin , french , nor italian , and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english .
he is a proper man picture , but , alas , who can converse with a ?
how oddly he is suited !
i think he bought his doublet in italy , his round hose in france , his bonnet in germany and his behavior every where .
what think you of the scottish lord , his neighbour ?
that he hath a neighbourly charity in him , for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another .
how like you the young german , the duke of saxony nephew ?
very vilely in the morning , when he is sober , and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk when he is best , he is a little worse than a man , and when he is worst , he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell , i hope i shall make shift to go without him .
if he should offer to choose , and choose the right casket , you should refuse to perform your father will , if you should refuse to accept him .
therefore , for fear of the worst , i pray thee , set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket , for if the devil be within and that temptation without , i know he will choose it .
i will do any thing , nerissa , ere i be married to a sponge .
you need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations , which is , indeed , to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit , unless you may be won by some other sort than your father imposition depending on the caskets .
if i live to be as old as sibylla , i will die as chaste as diana , unless i be obtained by the manner of my father will .
i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable , for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence , and i pray god grant them a fair departure .
do you not remember , lady , in your father time , a venetian , a scholar and a soldier , that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat ?
yes , yes , it was bassanio , as i think , he was so called .
true , madam he , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .
i remember him well , and i remember him worthy of thy praise .
enter a how now !
what news ?
the four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the prince of morocco , who brings word the prince his master will be here .
if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell , i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , i had rather he should shrive me than wive me .
come , nerissa .
sirrah , go before .
whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer , another knocks at the door .
exeunt scene iii .
venice .
a public place .
enter bassanio and shylock three thousand ducats , well .
ay , sir , for three months .
for three months , well .
for the which , as i told you , antonio shall be bound .
antonio shall become bound , well .
may you stead me ?
will you pleasure me ?
shall i know your answer ?
three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound .
your answer to that .
antonio is a good man .
have you heard any imputation to the contrary ?
oh , no , no , no , no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient .
yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis , another to the indies , i understand moreover , upon the rialto , he hath a third at mexico , a fourth for england , and other ventures he hath , squandered abroad .
but ships are but boards , sailors but men there be and , and , i mean pirates , and then there is the peril of waters , winds and rocks .
the man is , notwithstanding , sufficient .
three thousand ducats , i think i may take his bond .
be assured you may .
i will be assured i may , and , that i may be assured , i will bethink me .
may i speak with antonio ?
if it please you to dine with us .
yes , to smell pork , to eat of the habitation which your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into .
i will buy with you , sell with you , talk with you , walk with you , and so following , but i will not eat with you , drink with you , nor pray with you .
what news on the rialto ?
who is he comes here ?
enter antonio this is signior antonio .
aside how like a fawning publican he looks !
i hate him for he is a christian , but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice .
if i can catch him once upon the hip , i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him .
he hates our sacred nation , and he rails , even there where merchants most do congregate , on me , my bargains and my thrift , which he calls interest .
cursed be my tribe , if i forgive him !
shylock , do you hear ?
i am debating of my present store , and , by the near guess of my memory , i can not instantly raise up the gross of full three thousand ducats .
what of that ?
tubal , a wealthy hebrew of my tribe , will furnish me .
but soft !
how many months do you desire ?
to antonio rest you fair , good signior , your worship was the last man in our mouths .
shylock , although i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess , yet , to supply the ripe wants of my friend , i break a custom .
is he yet possess how much ye would ?
ay , ay , three thousand ducats .
and for three months .
i had forgot , three months , you told me so .
well then , your bond , and let me see , but hear you , methought you said you neither lend nor borrow upon advantage .
i do never use it .
when jacob grazed his uncle laban sheep this jacob from our holy abram was , as his wise mother wrought in his behalf , the third possessor , ay , he was the third and what of him ?
did he take interest ?
no , not take interest , not , as you would say , directly interest mark what jacob did .
when laban and himself were compromised that all the eanlings which were streak and pied should fall as jacob hire , the ewes , being rank , in the end of autumn turned to the rams , and , when the work of generation was between these woolly breeders in the act , the skilful shepherd peel me certain wands , and , in the doing of the deed of kind , he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes , who then conceiving did in eaning time fall lambs , and those were jacob .
this was a way to thrive , and he was blest and thrift is blessing , if men steal it not .
this was a venture , sir , that jacob served for , a thing not in his power to bring to pass , but sway and fashion by the hand of heaven .
was this inserted to make interest good ?
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ?
i can not tell , i make it breed as fast but note me , signior .
mark you this , bassanio , the devil can cite scripture for his purpose .
an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek , a goodly apple rotten at the heart o , what a goodly outside falsehood hath !
three thousand ducats , is a good round sum .
three months from twelve , then , let me see , the rate well , shylock , shall we be beholding to you ?
signior antonio , many a time and oft in the rialto you have rated me about my moneys and my usances still have i borne it with a patient shrug , for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe .
you call me misbeliever , dog , and spit upon my jewish gaberdine , and all for use of that which is mine own .
well then , it now appears you need my help go to , then , you come to me , and you say , we would have moneys ' you say so , you , that did void your rheum upon my beard and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur over your threshold moneys is your suit what should i say to you ?
should i not say a dog money ?
is it possible a cur can lend three thousand ducats ? '
or shall i bend low and in a bondman key , with bated breath and whispering humbleness , say this , sir , you spit on me on wednesday last , you spurn me such a day , another time you call me dog , and for these courtesies i lend you thus much moneys ' ?
i am as like to call thee so again , to spit on thee again , to spurn thee too .
if thou wilt lend this money , lend it not as to thy friends , for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend ?
but lend it rather to thine enemy , who , if he break , thou mayst with better face exact the penalty .
why , look you , how you storm !
i would be friends with you and have your love , forget the shames that you have stain me with , supply your present wants and take no doit of usance for my moneys , and you not hear me this is kind i offer .
this were kindness .
this kindness will i show .
go with me to a notary , seal me there your single bond , and , in a merry sport , if you repay me not on such a day , in such a place , such sum or sums as are express in the condition , let the forfeit be nominated for an equal pound of your fair flesh , to be cut off and taken in what part of your body pleaseth me .
content , i ' faith i seal to such a bond and say there is much kindness in the jew .
you shall not seal to such a bond for me i rather dwell in my necessity .
why , fear not , man , i will not forfeit it within these two months , that a month before this bond expires , i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond .
o father abram , what these christians are , whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect the thoughts of others !
pray you , tell me this , if he should break his day , what should i gain by the exaction of the forfeiture ?
a pound of man flesh taken from a man is not so estimable , profitable neither , as flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats .
i say , to buy his favour , i extend this friendship if he will take it , so , if not , adieu , and , for my love , i pray you wrong me not .
yes shylock , i will seal unto this bond .
then meet me forthwith at the notary , give him direction for this merry bond , and i will go and purse the ducats straight , see to my house , left in the fearful guard of an unthrifty knave , and presently i will be with you .
hie thee , gentle jew .
exit shylock the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind .
i like not fair terms and a villain mind .
come on in this there can be no dismay , my ships come home a month before the day .

flourish of cornets .
enter the prince of morocco and his train , portia , nerissa , and others attending mislike me not for my complexion , the shadow livery of the burnish sun , to whom i am a neighbour and near bred .
bring me the fairest creature northward born , where phoebus ' fire scarce thaws the icicles , and let us make incision for your love , to prove whose blood is reddest , his or mine .
i tell thee , lady , this aspect of mine hath fear the valiant by my love i swear the virgins of our clime have loved it too i would not change this hue , except to steal your thoughts , my gentle queen .
in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden eyes , besides , the lottery of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing but if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit , to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you , yourself , renowned prince , then stood as fair as any comer i have look on yet for my affection .
even for that i thank you therefore , i pray you , lead me to the caskets to try my fortune .
by this scimitar that slew the sophy and a persian prince that won three fields of sultan solyman , i would outstare the sternest eyes that look , outbrave the heart most daring on the earth , pluck the young sucking cubs from the , yea , mock the lion when he roars for prey , to win thee , lady .
but , alas the while !
if hercules and lichas play at dice which is the better man , the greater throw may turn by fortune from the weaker hand so is alcides beaten by his page , and so may i , blind fortune leading me , miss that which one unworthier may attain , and die with grieving .
you must take your chance , and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose , if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised .
nor will not .
come , bring me unto my chance .
first , forward to the temple after dinner your hazard shall be made .
good fortune then !

the fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying to me , launcelot gobbo , good launcelot , ' or gobbo , ' or good launcelot gobbo , use your legs , take the start , run away .
my conscience says , take heed , ' honest launcelot , take heed , honest gobbo , or , as aforesaid , launcelot gobbo , do not run , scorn running with thy heels . '
well , the most courageous fiend bids me pack ! '
says the fiend , ! '
says the fiend , the heavens , rouse up a brave mind , ' says the fiend , run . '
well , my conscience , hanging about the neck of my heart , says very wisely to me honest friend launcelot , being an honest man son , ' or rather an honest woman son , for , indeed , my father did something smack , something grow to , he had a kind of taste , well , my conscience says , budge not . '
, ' says the fiend .
not , ' says my conscience .
, ' say i , counsel well , ' ' fiend , ' say i , counsel well ' to be ruled by my conscience , i should stay with the jew my master , who , god bless the mark , is a kind of devil , and , to run away from the jew , i should be ruled by the fiend , who , saving your reverence , is the devil himself .
certainly the jew is the very devil incarnal , and , in my conscience , my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience , to offer to counsel me to stay with the jew .
the fiend gives the more friendly counsel i will run , fiend , my heels are at your command , i will run .
enter old gobbo , with a basket master young man , you , i pray you , which is the way to master jew ?

that is the very defect of the matter , sir .

pray thee , take pain to allay with some cold drops of modesty thy skipping spirit , lest through thy wild behavior i be misconstrued in the place i go to , and lose my hopes .
signior bassanio , hear me if i do not put on a sober habit , talk with respect and swear but now and then , wear in my pocket , look demurely , nay more , while grace is saying , hood mine eyes thus with my hat , and sigh and say , ' use all the observance of civility , like one well studied in a sad ostent to please his grandam , never trust me more .

enter jessica call you ?
what is your will ?
i am bid forth to supper , jessica there are my keys .
but wherefore should i go ?
i am not bid for love , they flatter me but yet i go in hate , to feed upon the prodigal christian .

what , are there masques ?
hear you me , jessica lock up my doors , and when you hear the drum and the vile squealing of the fife , clamber not you up to the casements then , nor thrust your head into the public street to gaze on christian fools with varnish faces , but stop my house ears , i mean my casements let not the sound of shallow foppery enter my sober house .
by jacob staff , i swear , i have no mind of feasting forth but i will go .
go you before me , sirrah , say i will come .
i will go before , sir .
mistress , look out at window , for all this , there will come a christian boy , will be worth a jewess ' eye .
exit what says that fool of hagar offspring , ha ?
his words were mistress , ' nothing else .
the patch is kind enough , but a huge feeder , in profit , and he sleeps by day more than the drones hive not with me , therefore i part with him , and part with him to one that would have him help to waste his borrow purse .
well , jessica , go in , perhaps i will return immediately do as i bid you , shut doors after you fast bind , fast find , a proverb never stale in thrifty mind .

exit scene vi .

enter gratiano and salarino , masqued this is the under which lorenzo desired us to make stand .
his hour is almost past .
and it is marvel he his hour , for lovers ever run before the clock .
o , ten times faster venus ' pigeons fly to seal love bonds , than they are wont to keep obliged faith unforfeited !
that ever holds who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down ?
where is the horse that doth untread again his tedious measures with the unbated fire that he did pace them first ?
all things that are , are with more spirit chased than enjoy .
how like a younker or a prodigal the scarfed bark puts from her native bay , hugg and embraced by the strumpet wind !
how like the prodigal doth she return , with ribs and ragged sails , lean , rent and beggar by the strumpet wind !
here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter .
enter lorenzo sweet friends , your patience for my long abode , not i , but my affairs , have made you wait when you shall please to play the thieves for wives , i watch as long for you then .
approach , here dwells my father jew .
ho !
who within ?
enter jessica , above , in boy clothes who are you ?
tell me , for more certainty , albeit i swear that i do know your tongue .
lorenzo , and thy love .
lorenzo , certain , and my love indeed , for who love i so much ?
and now who knows but you , lorenzo , whether i am yours ?
heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art .
here , catch this casket , it is worth the pains .
i am glad is night , you do not look on me , for i am much ashamed of my exchange but love is blind and lovers can not see the pretty follies that themselves commit , for if they could , cupid himself would blush to see me thus transformed to a boy .
descend , for you must be my torchbearer .
what , must i hold a candle to my shames ?
they in themselves , , are too too light .
why , is an office of discovery , love , and i should be obscured .
so are you , sweet , even in the lovely garnish of a boy .
but come at once , for the close night doth play the runaway , and we are stay for at bassanio feast .
i will make fast the doors , and gild myself with some more ducats , and be with you straight .
exit above now , by my hood , a gentile and no jew .
beshrew me but i love her heartily , for she is wise , if i can judge of her , and fair she is , if that mine eyes be true , and true she is , as she hath proved herself , and therefore , like herself , wise , fair and true , shall she be placed in my constant soul .

exeunt scene vii .
belmont .
a room in portia house .
flourish of cornets .
enter portia , with the prince of morocco , and their trains go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince .
now make your choice .
the first , of gold , who this inscription bears , chooseth me shall gain what many men desire , ' the second , silver , which this promise carries , chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves , ' this third , dull lead , with warning all as blunt , chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . '
how shall i know if i do choose the right ?
the one of them contains my picture , prince if you choose that , then i am yours withal .
some god direct my judgment !
let me see , i will survey the inscriptions back again .
what says this leaden casket ?
chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . '
must give for what ?
for lead ?
hazard for lead ?
this casket threatens .
men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross , i then nor give nor hazard aught for lead .
what says the silver with her virgin hue ?
chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . '
as much as he deserves !
pause there , morocco , and weigh thy value with an even hand if thou rated by thy estimation , thou dost deserve enough , and yet enough may not extend so far as to the lady and yet to be afeard of my deserving were but a weak disabling of myself .
as much as i deserve !
why , that the lady i do in birth deserve her , and in fortunes , in graces and in qualities of breeding , but more than these , in love i do deserve .
what if i stray no further , but chose here ?
let see once more this saying graved in gold chooseth me shall gain what many men desire . '
why , that the lady , all the world desires her , from the four corners of the earth they come , to kiss this shrine , this saint the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds of wide arabia are as thoroughfares now for princes to come view fair portia the watery kingdom , whose ambitious head spits in the face of heaven , is no bar to stop the foreign spirits , but they come , as a brook , to see fair portia .
one of these three contains her heavenly picture .
like that lead contains her ?
damnation to think so base a thought it were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave .
or shall i think in silver she immured , being ten times undervalued to tried gold ?
o sinful thought !
never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold .
they have in england a coin that bears the figure of an angel stamped in gold , but that insculp upon , but here an angel in a golden bed lies all within .
deliver me the key here do i choose , and thrive i as i may !
there , take it , prince , and if my form lie there , then i am yours .
he unlocks the golden casket o hell !
what have we here ?
a carrion death , within whose empty eye there is a written scroll !
i read the writing .
reads all that glitters is not gold , often have you heard that told many a man his life hath sold but my outside to behold gilded tombs do worms enfold .
had you been as wise as bold , young in limbs , in judgment old , your answer had not been inscroll fare you well , your suit is cold .
cold , indeed , and labour lost then , farewell , heat , and welcome , frost !
portia , adieu .
i have too grieved a heart to take a tedious leave thus losers part .
exit with his train .
flourish of cornets a gentle riddance .
draw the curtains , go .
let all of his complexion choose me so .

enter salarino and salanio why , man , i saw bassanio under sail with him is gratiano gone along , and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not .
the villain jew with outcries raised the duke , who went with him to search bassanio ship .
he came too late , the ship was under sail but there the duke was given to understand that in a gondola were seen together lorenzo and his amorous jessica besides , antonio certified the duke they were not with bassanio in his ship .
i never heard a passion so confused , so strange , outrageous , and so variable , as the dog jew did utter in the streets daughter !
o my ducats !
o my daughter !
fled with a christian !
o my christian ducats !
justice !
the law !
my ducats , and my daughter !
a sealed bag , two sealed bags of ducats , of double ducats , stolen from me by my daughter !
and jewels , two stones , two rich and precious stones , stolen by my daughter !
justice !
find the girl , she hath the stones upon her , and the ducats . '
why , all the boys in venice follow him , crying , his stones , his daughter , and his ducats .
let good antonio look he keep his day , or he shall pay for this .
marry , well remember .
i reason with a frenchman yesterday , who told me , in the narrow seas that part the french and english , there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught i thought upon antonio when he told me , and wish in silence that it were not his .
you were best to tell antonio what you hear , yet do not suddenly , for it may grieve him .
a kinder gentleman treads not the earth .
i saw bassanio and antonio part bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return he answer , not so , slubber not business for my sake , bassanio but stay the very riping of the time , and for the jew bond which he hath of me , let it not enter in your mind of love be merry , and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship and such fair ostents of love as shall conveniently become you there ' and even there , his eye being big with tears , turning his face , he put his hand behind him , and with affection wondrous sensible he wrung bassanio hand , and so they parted .
i think he only loves the world for him .
i pray thee , let us go and find him out and quicken his embraced heaviness with some delight or other .
do we so .

flourish of cornets .
enter the prince of arragon , portia , and their trains behold , there stand the caskets , noble prince if you choose that wherein i am contain , straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized but if you fail , without more speech , my lord , you must be gone from hence immediately .
i am enjoin by oath to observe three things first , never to unfold to any one which casket was i chose , next , if i fail of the right casket , never in my life to woo a maid in way of marriage lastly , if i do fail in fortune of my choice , immediately to leave you and be gone .
to these injunctions every one doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self .
and so have i address me .
fortune now to my heart hope !
gold , silver , and base lead .
chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . '
you shall look fairer , ere i give or hazard .
what says the golden chest ?
ha !
let me see chooseth me shall gain what many men desire . '
what many men desire !
that ' may be meant by the fool multitude , that choose by show , not learning more than the fond eye doth teach , which pries not to the interior , but , like the martlet , builds in the weather on the outward wall , even in the force and road of casualty .
i will not choose what many men desire , because i will not jump with common spirits and rank me with the barbarous multitudes .
why , then to thee , thou silver , tell me once more what title thou dost bear chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ' and well said too , for who shall go about to cozen fortune and be honourable without the stamp of merit ?
let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity .
o , that estates , degrees and offices were not derived corruptly , and that clear honour were purchased by the merit of the wearer !
how many then should cover that stand bare !
how many be commanded that command !
how much low peasantry would then be glean from the true seed of honour !
and how much honour pick from the chaff and ruin of the times to be !
well , but to my choice chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . '
i will assume desert .
give me a key for this , and instantly unlock my fortunes here .
he opens the silver casket too long a pause for that which you find there .
what here ?
the portrait of a blinking idiot , presenting me a schedule !
i will read it .
how much unlike art thou to portia !
how much unlike my hopes and my deservings !
chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves . '
did i deserve no more than a fool head ?
is that my prize ?
are my deserts no better ?
to offend , and judge , are distinct offices and of opposed natures .
what is here ?
reads the fire seven times tried this seven times tried that judgment is , that did never choose amiss .
some there be that shadows kiss , such have but a shadow bliss there be fools alive , i wis , silver , and so was this .
take what wife you will to bed , i will ever be your head so be gone you are sped .
still more fool i shall appear by the time i linger here with one fool head i came to woo , but i go away with two .
sweet , adieu .
i keep my oath , patiently to bear my wroth .
exeunt arragon and train thus hath the candle singed the moth .
o , these deliberate fools !

here what would my lord ?
madam , there is alighted at your gate a young venetian , one that comes before to signify the approaching of his lord , from whom he bringeth sensible regreets , to wit , besides commends and courteous breath , gifts of rich value .
yet i have not seen so likely an ambassador of love a day in april never came so sweet , to show how costly summer was at hand , as this comes before his lord .
no more , i pray thee i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee , thou such wit in praising him .

enter salanio and salarino now , what news on the rialto ?
why , yet it lives there uncheck that antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas , the goodwins , i think they call the place , a very dangerous flat and fatal , where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried , as they say , if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word .
i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband .
but it is true , without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk , that the good antonio , the honest antonio , o that i had a title good enough to keep his name company ! come , the full stop .
ha !
what sayest thou ?
why , the end is , he hath lost a ship .
i would it might prove the end of his losses .
let me say ' betimes , lest the devil cross my prayer , for here he comes in the likeness of a jew .
enter shylock how now , shylock !
what news among the merchants ?
you know , none so well , none so well as you , of my daughter flight .
that certain i , for my part , knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal .
and shylock , for his own part , knew the bird was fledged , and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam .
she is damned for it .
that certain , if the devil may be her judge .
my own flesh and blood to rebel !
out upon it , old carrion !
rebels it at these years ?
i say , my daughter is my flesh and blood .
there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory , more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish .
but tell us , do you hear whether antonio have had any loss at sea or no ?
there i have another bad match a bankrupt , a prodigal , who dare scarce show his head on the rialto , a beggar , that was used to come so smug upon the mart , let him look to his bond he was wont to call me usurer , let him look to his bond he was wont to lend money for a christian courtesy , let him look to his bond .
why , i am sure , if he forfeit , thou wilt not take his flesh what that good for ?
to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else , it will feed my revenge .
he hath disgraced me , and hindered me half a million , laughed at my losses , mocked at my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies , and what his reason ?
i am a jew .
hath not a jew eyes ?
hath not a jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?
fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer , as a christian is ?
if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
if you poison us , do we not die ?
and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?
if we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that .
if a jew wrong a christian , what is his humility ?
revenge .
if a christian wrong a jew , what should his sufferance be by christian example ?
why , revenge .
the villany you teach me , i will execute , and it shall go hard but i will better the instruction .

but lest you should not understand me well , and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought , i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me .
i could teach you how to choose right , but i am then forsworn , so will i never be so may you miss me , but if you do , you make me wish a sin , that i had been forsworn .
beshrew your eyes , they have me and divided me , one half of me is yours , the other half yours , mine own , i would say , but if mine , then yours , and so all yours .
o , these naughty times put bars between the owners and their rights !
and so , though yours , not yours .
prove it so , let fortune go to hell for it , not i .
i speak too long , but is to peize the time , to eke it and to draw it out in length , to stay you from election .
let me choose for as i am , i live upon the rack .
upon the rack , bassanio !
then confess what treason there is mingled with your love .
none but that ugly treason of mistrust , which makes me fear the enjoying of my love there may as well be amity and life snow and fire , as treason and my love .
ay , but i fear you speak upon the rack , where men enforced do speak anything .
promise me life , and i confess the truth .
well then , confess and live .
' and ' had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment , when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance !
but let me to my fortune and the caskets .
away , then !
i am lock in one of them if you do love me , you will find me out .
nerissa and the rest , stand all aloof .
let music sound while he doth make his choice , then , if he lose , he makes a end , fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper , my eye shall be the stream and watery for him .
he may win , and what is music then ?
then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom ear , and summon him to marriage .
now he goes , with no less presence , but with much more love , than young alcides , when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives , with bleared visages , come forth to view the issue of the exploit .
go , hercules !
live thou , i live with much , much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makest the fray .
music , whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself song .
tell me where is fancy bred , or in the heart , or in the head ?
how begot , how nourished ?
reply , reply .
it is engender in the eyes , with gazing fed , and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies .
let us all ring fancy knell i begin it , ding , dong , bell .
ding , dong , bell .
so may the outward shows be least themselves the world is still deceived with ornament .
in law , what plea so tainted and corrupt , but , being seasoned with a gracious voice , obscures the show of evil ?
in religion , what damned error , but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text , hiding the grossness with fair ornament ?
there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards , whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand , wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars , who , inward search , have livers white as milk , and these assume but valour excrement to render them redoubted !
look on beauty , and you shall see is purchased by the weight , which therein works a miracle in nature , making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind , upon supposed fairness , often known to be the dowry of a second head , the skull that bred them in the sepulchre .
thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea , the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty , in a word , the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest .
therefore , thou gaudy gold , hard food for midas , i will none of thee , nor none of thee , thou pale and common drudge man and man but thou , thou meagre lead , which rather threatenest than dost promise aught , thy paleness moves me more than eloquence , and here choose i , joy be the consequence !
aside how all the other passions fleet to air , as doubtful thoughts , and despair , and shuddering fear , and jealousy !
o love , be moderate , allay thy ecstasy , in measure rein thy joy , scant this excess .
i feel too much thy blessing make it less , for fear i surfeit .
what find i here ?
opening the leaden casket fair portia counterfeit !
what hath come so near creation ?
move these eyes ?
or whether , riding on the balls of mine , seem they in motion ?
here are sever lips , parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends .
here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men , faster than gnats in cobwebs , but her eyes , how could he see to do them ?
having made one , methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnish .
yet look , how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it , so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance .
here the scroll , the continent and summary of my fortune .
reads you that choose not by the view , chance as fair and choose as true !
since this fortune falls to you , be content and seek no new , if you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss , turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss .
a gentle scroll .
fair lady , by your leave , i come by note , to give and to receive .
like one of two contending in a prize , that thinks he hath done well in people eyes , hearing applause and universal shout , giddy in spirit , still gazing in a doubt whether these pearls of praise be his or no , so , thrice fair lady , stand i , even so , as doubtful whether what i see be true , until confirm , sign , ratified by you .
you see me , lord bassanio , where i stand , such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish , to wish myself much better , yet , for you i would be trebled twenty times myself , a thousand times more fair , ten thousand times more rich , that only to stand high in your account , i might in virtue , beauties , livings , friends , exceed account , but the full sum of me is sum of something , which , to term in gross , is an unlesson girl , unschool , unpractised , happy in this , she is not yet so old but she may learn , happier than this , she is not bred so dull but she can learn , happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed , as from her lord , her governor , her king .
myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion , master of my servants , queen myself and even now , but now , this house , these servants and this same myself are yours , my lord i give them with this ring , which when you part from , lose , or give away , let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you .
madam , you have bereft me of all words , only my blood speaks to you in my veins , and there is such confusion in my powers , as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince , there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude , where every something , being blent together , turns to a wild of nothing , save of joy , express and not express .
but when this ring parts from this finger , then parts life from hence o , then be bold to say bassanio dead !
my lord and lady , it is now our time , that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper , to cry , good joy good joy , my lord and lady !
my lord bassanio and my gentle lady , i wish you all the joy that you can wish , for i am sure you can wish none from me and when your honours mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith , i do beseech you , even at that time i may be married too .
with all my heart , so thou canst get a wife .
i thank your lordship , you have got me one .
my eyes , my lord , can look as swift as yours you saw the mistress , i beheld the maid , you loved , i loved for intermission .
no more pertains to me , my lord , than you .
your fortune stood upon the casket there , and so did mine too , as the matter falls , for wooing here until i sweat again , and sweating until my very roof was dry with oaths of love , at last , if promise last , i got a promise of this fair one here to have her love , provided that your fortune achieved her mistress .
is this true , nerissa ?
madam , it is , so you stand pleased withal .
and do you , gratiano , mean good faith ?
yes , faith , my lord .
our feast shall be much honour in your marriage .
we play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats .
what , and stake down ?
no , we shall win at that sport , and stake down .
but who comes here ?
lorenzo and his infidel ?
what , and my old venetian friend salerio ?
enter lorenzo , jessica , and salerio , a messenger from venice lorenzo and salerio , welcome hither , if that the youth of my new interest here have power to bid you welcome .
by your leave , i bid my very friends and countrymen , sweet portia , welcome .
so do i , my lord they are entirely welcome .
i thank your honour .
for my part , my lord , my purpose was not to have seen you here , but meeting with salerio by the way , he did entreat me , past all saying nay , to come with him along .
i did , my lord , and i have reason for it .
signior antonio commends him to you .
gives bassanio a letter ere i ope his letter , i pray you , tell me how my good friend doth .
not sick , my lord , unless it be in mind , nor well , unless in mind his letter there will show you his estate .
nerissa , cheer yon stranger , bid her welcome .
your hand , salerio what the news from venice ?
how doth that royal merchant , good antonio ?
i know he will be glad of our success , we are the jasons , we have won the fleece .
i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost .
there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper , that steals the colour from bassanio cheek some dear friend dead , else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man .
what , worse and worse !
with leave , bassanio i am half yourself , and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you .
o sweet portia , here are a few of the words that ever blotted paper !
gentle lady , when i did first impart my love to you , i freely told you , all the wealth i had ran in my veins , i was a gentleman , and then i told you true and yet , dear lady , rating myself at nothing , you shall see how much i was a braggart .
when i told you my state was nothing , i should then have told you that i was worse than nothing , for , indeed , i have engaged myself to a dear friend , engaged my friend to his mere enemy , to feed my means .
here is a letter , lady , the paper as the body of my friend , and every word in it a gaping wound , issuing .
but is it true , salerio ?
have all his ventures fail ?
what , not one hit ?
from tripolis , from mexico and england , from lisbon , barbary and india ?
and not one vessel the dreadful touch of rocks ?
not one , my lord .
besides , it should appear , that if he had the present money to discharge the jew , he would not take it .
never did i know a creature , that did bear the shape of man , so keen and greedy to confound a man he plies the duke at morning and at night , and doth impeach the freedom of the state , if they deny him justice twenty merchants , the duke himself , and the magnificoes of greatest port , have all persuaded with him , but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture , of justice and his bond .
when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus , his countrymen , that he would rather have antonio flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him and i know , my lord , if law , authority and power deny not , it will go hard with poor antonio .
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble ?
the dearest friend to me , the kindest man , the and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies , and one in whom the ancient roman honour more appears than any that draws breath in italy .
what sum owes he the jew ?
for me three thousand ducats .
what , no more ?
pay him six thousand , and deface the bond , double six thousand , and then treble that , before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanio fault .
first go with me to church and call me wife , and then away to venice to your friend , for never shall you lie by portia side with an unquiet soul .
you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over when it is paid , bring your true friend along .
my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows .
come , away !
for you shall hence upon your bid your friends welcome , show a merry cheer since you are dear bought , i will love you dear .
but let me hear the letter of your friend .
reads sweet bassanio , my ships have all miscarried , my creditors grow cruel , my estate is very low , my bond to the jew is forfeit , and since in paying it , it is impossible i should live , all debts are cleared between you and i , if i might but see you at my death .
notwithstanding , use your pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come , let not my letter .
o love , dispatch all business , and be gone !
since i have your good leave to go away , i will make haste but , till i come again , no bed shall be guilty of my stay , no rest be interposer us twain .
exeunt scene iii .
venice .
a street .
enter shylock , salarino , antonio , and gaoler gaoler , look to him tell not me of mercy , this is the fool that lent out money gratis gaoler , look to him .
hear me yet , good shylock .
i have my bond , speak not against my bond i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond .
thou me dog before thou hadst a cause , but , since i am a dog , beware my fangs the duke shall grant me justice .
i do wonder , thou naughty gaoler , that thou art so fond to come abroad with him at his request .
i pray thee , hear me speak .
i have my bond , i will not hear thee speak i have my bond , and therefore speak no more .
i not be made a soft and fool , to shake the head , relent , and sigh , and yield to christian intercessors .
follow not , i have no speaking i will have my bond .
exit it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men .
let him alone i follow him no more with bootless prayers .
he seeks my life , his reason well i know i oft deliver from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me , therefore he hates me .
i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold .
the duke can not deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice , if it be denied , will much impeach the justice of his state , since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations .
therefore , go these griefs and losses have so bated me , that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh to my bloody creditor .
well , gaoler , on .
pray god , bassanio come to see me pay his debt , and then i care not !
exeunt scene iv .
belmont .
a room in portia house .
enter portia , nerissa , lorenzo , jessica , and balthasar madam , although i speak it in your presence , you have a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity , which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord .
but if you knew to whom you show this honour , how true a gentleman you send relief , how dear a lover of my lord your husband , i know you would be prouder of the work than customary bounty can enforce you .
i never did repent for doing good , nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together , whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love , there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments , of manners and of spirit , which makes me think that this antonio , being the bosom lover of my lord , must needs be like my lord .
if it be so , how little is the cost i have bestow in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish misery !
this comes too near the praising of myself , therefore no more of it hear other things .
lorenzo , i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord return for mine own part , i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation , only attended by nerissa here , until her husband and my lord return there is a monastery two miles off , and there will we abide .
i do desire you not to deny this imposition , the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you .
madam , with all my heart , i shall obey you in all fair commands .
my people do already know my mind , and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself .
and so farewell , till we shall meet again .
fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you !
i wish your ladyship all heart content .
i thank you for your wish , and am well pleased to wish it back on you fare you well jessica .
exeunt jessica and lorenzo now , balthasar , as i have ever found thee , so let me find thee still .
take this same letter , and use thou all the endeavour of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousin hand , doctor bellario , and , look , what notes and garments he doth give thee , bring them , i pray thee , with imagined speed unto the tranect , to the common ferry which trades to venice .
waste no time in words , but get thee gone i shall be there before thee .
madam , i go with all convenient speed .
exit come on , nerissa , i have work in hand that you yet know not of we see our husbands before they think of us .
shall they see us ?
they shall , nerissa , but in such a habit , that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack .
i hold thee any wager , when we are both accoutred like young men , i prove the prettier fellow of the two , and wear my dagger with the braver grace , and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice , and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride , and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth , and tell quaint lies , how honourable ladies sought my love , which i denying , they fell sick and died , i could not do withal , then i repent , and wish for all that , that i had not killed them , and twenty of these puny lies i tell , that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth .
i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks , which i will practise .
why , shall we turn to men ?
fie , what a question that , if thou wert near a lewd interpreter !
but come , i tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach , which stays for us at the park gate , and therefore haste away , for we must measure twenty miles .
exeunt scene the same .
a garden .
enter launcelot and jessica yes , truly , for , look you , the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children therefore , i promise ye , i fear you .
i was always plain with you , and so now i speak my agitation of the matter therefore be of good cheer , for truly i think you are damned .
there is but one hope in it that can do you any good , and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither .
and what hope is that , i pray thee ?
marry , you may partly hope that your father got you not , that you are not the jew daughter .
that were a kind of bastard hope , indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me .
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother thus when i shun scylla , your father , i fall into charybdis , your mother well , you are gone both ways .
i shall be saved by my husband , he hath made me a christian .
truly , the more to blame he we were christians enow before , as many as could well live , one by another .
this making christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be , we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money .
enter lorenzo i tell my husband , launcelot , what you say here he comes .
i shall grow jealous of you shortly , launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners .
nay , you need not fear us , lorenzo launcelot and i are out .
he tells me flatly , there is no mercy for me in heaven , because i am a jew daughter and he says , you are no good member of the commonwealth , for in converting jews to christians , you raise the price of pork .
i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro belly the moor is with child by you , launcelot .
it is much that the moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman , she is indeed more than i took her for .
how every fool can play upon the word !
i think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence , and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots .
go in , sirrah , bid them prepare for dinner .
that is done , sir , they have all stomachs .
goodly lord , what a are you !
then bid them prepare dinner .
that is done too , sir , only ' is the word .
will you cover then , sir ?
not so , sir , neither , i know my duty .
yet more quarrelling with occasion !
wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant ?
i pray tree , understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows , bid them cover the table , serve in the meat , and we will come in to dinner .
for the table , sir , it shall be served in , for the meat , sir , it shall be covered , for your coming in to dinner , sir , why , let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .
exit o dear discretion , how his words are suited !
the fool hath planted in his memory an army of good words , and i do know a many fools , that stand in better place , garnish like him , that for a tricksy word defy the matter .
how cheerest thou , jessica ?
and now , good sweet , say thy opinion , how dost thou like the lord bassanio wife ?
past all expressing .
it is very meet the lord bassanio live an upright life , for , having such a blessing in his lady , he finds the joys of heaven here on earth , and if on earth he do not mean it , then in reason he should never come to heaven why , if two gods should play some heavenly match and on the wager lay two earthly women , and portia one , there must be something else pawn with the other , for the poor rude world hath not her fellow .
even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife .
nay , but ask my opinion too of that .
i will anon first , let us go to dinner .
nay , let me praise you while i have a stomach .
no , pray thee , let it serve for , ' then , thou , other things i shall digest it .
well , i set you forth .
exeunt act iv scene venice .
a court of justice .
enter the duke , the magnificoes , antonio , bassanio , gratiano , salerio , and others what , is antonio here ?
ready , so please your grace .
i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer a stony adversary , an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity , void and empty from any dram of mercy .
i have heard your grace hath great pains to qualify his rigorous course , but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy reach , i do oppose my patience to his fury , and am arm to suffer , with a quietness of spirit , the very tyranny and rage of his .
go one , and call the jew into the court .
he is ready at the door he comes , my lord .
enter shylock make room , and let him stand before our face .
shylock , the world thinks , and i think so too , that thou but this fashion of thy malice to the last hour of act , and then is thought show thy mercy and remorse more strange than is thy strange apparent cruelty , and where thou now the penalty , which is a pound of this poor merchant flesh , thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture , but , touch with human gentleness and love , forgive a moiety of the principal , glancing an eye of pity on his losses , that have of late so huddled on his back , enow to press a royal merchant down and pluck commiseration of his state from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint , from stubborn turks and tartars , never train to offices of tender courtesy .
we all expect a gentle answer , jew .
i have possess your grace of what i purpose , and by our holy sabbath have i sworn to have the due and forfeit of my bond if you deny it , let the danger light upon your charter and your city freedom .
you ask me , why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats i not answer that but , say , it is my humour is it answer ?
what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats to have it baned ?
what , are you answer yet ?
some men there are love not a gaping pig , some , that are mad if they behold a cat , and others , when the bagpipe sings i ' the nose , can not contain their urine for affection , mistress of passion , sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes .
now , for your answer as there is no firm reason to be render , why he can not abide a gaping pig , why he , a harmless necessary cat , why he , a woollen bagpipe , but of force must yield to such inevitable shame as to offend , himself being offended , so can i give no reason , nor i will not , more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing i bear antonio , that i follow thus a losing suit against him .
are you answer ?
this is no answer , thou unfeeling man , to excuse the current of thy cruelty .
i am not bound to please thee with my answers .
do all men kill the things they do not love ?
hates any man the thing he would not kill ?
every offence is not a hate at first .
what , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ?
i pray you , think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height , you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb , you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise , when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven , you may as well do anything most hard , as seek to soften that than which what harder ? his jewish heart therefore , i do beseech you , make no more offers , use no farther means , but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will .
for thy three thousand ducats here is six .
what judgment shall i dread , doing were in six parts and every part a ducat , i would not draw them , i would have my bond .
how shalt thou hope for mercy , rendering none ?
what judgment shall i dread , doing no wrong ?
you have among you many a purchased slave , which , like your asses and your dogs and mules , you use in abject and in slavish parts , because you bought them shall i say to you , let them be free , marry them to your heirs ?
why sweat they under burthens ?
let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be season with such viands ?
you will answer slaves are ours ' so do i answer you the pound of flesh , which i demand of him , is dearly bought , is mine and i will have it .
if you deny me , fie upon your law !
there is no force in the decrees of venice .
i stand for judgment answer , shall i have it ?
upon my power i may dismiss this court , unless bellario , a learned doctor , whom i have sent for to determine this , come here .
my lord , here stays without a messenger with letters from the doctor , new come from padua .
bring us the letter , call the messenger .
good cheer , antonio !
what , man , courage yet !
the jew shall have my flesh , blood , bones and all , ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood .
i am a tainted wether of the flock , meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground , and so let me you can not better be employ , bassanio , than to live still and write mine epitaph .
enter nerissa , dressed like a lawyer clerk came you from padua , from bellario ?
from both , my lord .
bellario greets your grace .
presenting a letter why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly ?
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .
not on thy sole , but on thy soul , harsh jew , thou makest thy knife keen , but no metal can , no , not the hangman axe , bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy .
can no prayers pierce thee ?
no , none that thou hast wit enough to make .
o , be thou damn , inexecrable dog !
and for thy life let justice be accused .
thou almost makest me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras , that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men thy currish spirit govern a wolf , who , hang for human slaughter , even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet , and , whilst thou in thy unhallow dam , infused itself in thee , for thy desires are wolvish , bloody , starved and ravenous .
till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond , thou but thy lungs to speak so loud repair thy wit , good youth , or it will fall to cureless ruin .
i stand here for law .
this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court .
where is he ?
he attendeth here hard by , to know your answer , whether you admit him .
with all my heart .
some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place .
meantime the court shall hear bellario letter .
reads your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came , in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome , his name is balthasar .
i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we turned many books together he is furnished with my opinion , which , bettered with his own learning , the greatness whereof i can not enough commend , comes with him , at my importunity , to fill up your grace request in my stead .
i beseech you , let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation , for i never knew so young a body with so old a head .
i leave him to your gracious acceptance , whose trial shall better publish his commendation .
you hear the learn bellario , what he writes and here , i take it , is the doctor come .
enter portia , dressed like a doctor of laws give me your hand .
come you from old bellario ?
i did , my lord .
you are welcome take your place .
are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court ?
i am informed thoroughly of the cause .
which is the merchant here , and which the jew ?
antonio and old shylock , both stand forth .
is your name shylock ?
shylock is my name .
of a strange nature is the suit you follow , yet in such rule that the venetian law can not impugn you as you do proceed .
you stand within his danger , do you not ?
ay , so he says .
do you confess the bond ?
i do .
then must the jew be merciful .
on what compulsion must i ?
tell me that .
the quality of mercy is not strain , it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest , it blesseth him that gives and him that takes is mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown , his sceptre shows the force of temporal power , the attribute to awe and majesty , wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings , but mercy is above this sceptred sway , it is enthroned in the hearts of kings , it is an attribute to god himself , and earthly power doth then show likest god when mercy seasons justice .
therefore , jew , though justice be thy plea , consider this , that , in the course of justice , none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy , and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy .
i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea , which if thou follow , this strict court of venice must needs give sentence the merchant there .
my deeds upon my head !
i crave the law , the penalty and forfeit of my bond .
is he not able to discharge the money ?
yes , here i tender it for him in the court , yea , twice the sum if that will not suffice , i will be bound to pay it ten times , on forfeit of my hands , my head , my heart if this will not suffice , it must appear that malice bears down truth .
and i beseech you , wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right , do a little wrong , and curb this cruel devil of his will .
it must not be , there is no power in venice can alter a decree established be recorded for a precedent , and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it can not be .
a daniel come to judgment !
yea , a daniel !
o wise young judge , how i do honour thee !
i pray you , let me look upon the bond .
here is , most reverend doctor , here it is .
shylock , there thrice thy money offer thee .
an oath , an oath , i have an oath in heaven shall i lay perjury upon my soul ?
no , not for venice .
why , this bond is forfeit , and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh , to be by him cut off nearest the merchant heart .
be merciful take thrice thy money , bid me tear the bond .
when it is paid according to the tenor .
it doth appear you are a worthy judge , you know the law , your exposition hath been most sound i charge you by the law , whereof you are a pillar , proceed to judgment by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me i stay here on my bond .
most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment .
why then , thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife .
o noble judge !
o excellent young man !
for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty , which here appeareth due upon the bond .
is very true o wise and upright judge !
how much more elder art thou than thy looks !
therefore lay bare your bosom .
ay , his breast so says the bond doth it not , noble judge ?
his heart ' those are the very words .
it is so .
are there balance here to weigh the flesh ?
i have them ready .
have by some surgeon , shylock , on your charge , to stop his wounds , lest he do bleed to death .
is it so nominated in the bond ?
it is not so express but what of that ?
good you do so much for charity .
i can not find it , is not in the bond .
you , merchant , have you any thing to say ?
but little i am arm and well prepared .
give me your hand , bassanio fare you well !
grieve not that i am fallen to this for you , for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth , to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty , from which lingering penance of such misery doth she cut me off .
commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonio end , say how i loved you , speak me fair in death , and , when the tale is told , bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love .
repent but you that you shall lose your friend , and he repents not that he pays your debt , for if the jew do cut but deep enough , i pay it presently with all my heart .
antonio , i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself , but life itself , my wife , and all the world , are not with me esteem above thy life i would lose all , ay , sacrifice them all here to this devil , to deliver you .
your wife would give you little thanks for that , if she were by , to hear you make the offer .
i have a wife , whom , i protest , i love i would she were in heaven , so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew .
is well you offer it behind her back , the wish would make else an unquiet house .
these be the christian husbands .
i have a daughter , would any of the stock of barrabas had been her husband rather than a christian !
aside we trifle time i pray thee , pursue sentence .
a pound of that same merchant flesh is thine the court awards it , and the law doth give it .
most rightful judge !
and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it , and the court awards it .
most learned judge !
a sentence !
come , prepare !
tarry a little , there is something else .
this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood , the words expressly are ' a pound of flesh ' take then thy bond , take thou thy pound of flesh , but , in the cutting it , if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood , thy lands and goods are , by the laws of venice , confiscate unto the state of venice .
o upright judge !
mark , jew o learned judge !
is that the law ?
thyself shalt see the act for , as thou urgest justice , be assured thou shalt have justice , more than thou desirest .
o learned judge !
mark , jew a learned judge !
i take this offer , then , pay the bond thrice and let the christian go .
here is the money .
soft !
the jew shall have all justice , soft !
no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty .
o jew !
an upright judge , a learned judge !
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .
shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou more or less than a just pound , be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance , or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple , nay , if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair , thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate .
a second daniel , a daniel , jew !
now , infidel , i have you on the hip .
why doth the jew pause ?
take thy forfeiture .
give me my principal , and let me go .
i have it ready for thee , here it is .
he hath refused it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond .
a daniel , still say i , a second daniel !
i thank thee , jew , for teaching me that word .
shall i not have barely my principal ?
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture , to be so taken at thy peril , jew .
why , then the devil give him good of it !
i stay no longer question .
tarry , jew the law hath yet another hold on you .
it is enacted in the laws of venice , if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen , the party the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods , the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state , and the offender life lies in the mercy of the duke only , all other voice .
in which predicament , i say , thou , for it appears , by manifest proceeding , that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant , and thou hast incurr the danger formerly by me rehearsed .
down therefore and beg mercy of the duke .
beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself and yet , thy wealth being forfeit to the state , thou hast not left the value of a cord , therefore thou must be hang at the state charge .
that thou shalt see the difference of our spirits , i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it for half thy wealth , it is antonio , the other half comes to the general state , which humbleness may drive unto a fine .
ay , for the state , not for antonio .
nay , take my life and all , pardon not that you take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house , you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live .
what mercy can you render him , antonio ?
a halter gratis , nothing else , for god sake .
so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods , i am content , so he will let me have the other half in use , to render it , upon his death , unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter two things provided more , that , for this favour , he presently become a christian , the other , that he do record a gift , here in the court , of all he dies possess , unto his son lorenzo and his daughter .
he shall do this , or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronounced here .
art thou contented , jew ?
what dost thou say ?
i am content .
clerk , draw a deed of gift .
i pray you , give me leave to go from hence , i am not well send the deed after me , and i will sign it .
get thee gone , but do it .
in christening shalt thou have two had i been judge , thou shouldst have had ten more , to bring thee to the gallows , not the font .
exit shylock sir , i entreat you home with me to dinner .
i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua , and it is meet i presently set forth .
i am sorry that your leisure serves you not .
antonio , gratify this gentleman , for , in my mind , you are much bound to him .
exeunt duke and his train most worthy gentleman , i and my friend have by your wisdom been this day acquitted of grievous penalties , in lieu whereof , three thousand ducats , due unto the jew , we freely cope your courteous pains withal .
and stand indebted , over and above , in love and service to you evermore .
he is well paid that is well satisfied , and i , delivering you , am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary .
i pray you , know me when we meet again i wish you well , and so i take my leave .
dear sir , of force i must attempt you further take some remembrance of us , as a tribute , not as a fee grant me two things , i pray you , not to deny me , and to pardon me .
you press me far , and therefore i will yield .
to antonio give me your gloves , i wear them for your sake , to bassanio and , for your love , i take this ring from you do not draw back your hand , i take no more , and you in love shall not deny me this .
this ring , good sir , alas , it is a trifle !
i will not shame myself to give you this .
i will have nothing else but only this , and now methinks i have a mind to it .
there more depends on this than on the value .
the dearest ring in venice will i give you , and find it out by proclamation only for this , i pray you , pardon me .
i see , sir , you are liberal in offers you taught me first to beg , and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answer .
good sir , this ring was given me by my wife , and when she put it on , she made me vow that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it .
that serves many men to save their gifts .
an if your wife be not a , and know how well i have deserved the ring , she would not hold out enemy for ever , for giving it to me .
well , peace be with you !
exeunt portia and nerissa my lord bassanio , let him have the ring let his deservings and my love withal be valued against your wife commandment .
go , gratiano , run and overtake him , give him the ring , and bring him , if thou canst , unto antonio house away !
make haste .

aloud away !
make haste thou knowist where i will tarry .
come , good sir , will you show me to this house ?
exeunt act v scene belmont .
avenue to portia house .
enter lorenzo and jessica the moon shines bright in such a night as this , when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise , in such a night troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls and sigh his soul toward the grecian tents , where cressid lay that night .
in such a night did thisbe fearfully the dew and saw the lion shadow ere himself and ran dismay away .
in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage .
in such a night medea gather the enchanted herbs that did renew old aeson .
in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont .
in such a night did young lorenzo swear he loved her well , stealing her soul with many vows of faith and a true one .
in such a night did pretty jessica , like a little shrew , slander her love , and he forgave it her .
i would you , did no body come , but , hark , i hear the footing of a man .
enter stephano who comes so fast in silence of the night ?
a friend .
a friend !
what friend ?
your name , i pray you , friend ?
stephano is my name , and i bring word my mistress will before the break of day be here at belmont , she doth stray about by holy crosses , where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours .
who comes with her ?
none but a holy hermit and her maid .
i pray you , is my master yet return ?
he is not , nor we have not heard from him .
but go we in , i pray thee , jessica , and ceremoniously let us prepare some welcome for the mistress of the house .
enter launcelot sola , sola !
wo ha , ho !
sola , sola !
who calls ?
sola !
did you see master lorenzo ?
master lorenzo , sola , sola !
leave hollaing , man here .
sola !
where ?
where ?
here .
tell him there a post come from my master , with his horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning .
exit sweet soul , let in , and there expect their coming .
and yet no matter why should we go in ?
my friend stephano , signify , i pray you , within the house , your mistress is at hand , and bring your music forth into the air .
exit stephano how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !
here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony .
sit , jessica .
look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold there not the smallest orb which thou but in his motion like an angel sings , still quiring to the cherubins , such harmony is in immortal souls , but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in , we can not hear it .
enter musicians come , ho !
and wake diana with a hymn !
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ' ear , and draw her home with music .
music i am never merry when i hear sweet music .
the reason is , your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd , or race of youthful and unhandled colts , fetching mad bounds , bellowing and neighing loud , which is the hot condition of their blood , if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound , or any air of music touch their ears , you shall perceive them make a mutual stand , their savage eyes turn to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees , stones and floods , since nought so stockish , hard and full of rage , but music for the time doth change his nature .
the man that hath no music in himself , nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds , is fit for treasons , stratagems and spoils , the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted .
mark the music .
enter portia and nerissa that light we see is burning in my hall .
how far that little candle throws his beams !
so shines a good deed in a naughty world .
when the moon shone , we did not see the candle .
so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king unto the king be by , and then his state empties itself , as doth an inland brook into the main of waters .
music !
hark !
it is your music , madam , of the house .
nothing is good , i see , without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day .
silence bestows that virtue on it , madam .
the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark , when neither is attended , and i think the nightingale , if she should sing by day , when every goose is cackling , would be thought no better a musician than the wren .
how many things by season season are to their right praise and true perfection !
peace , ho !
the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked .
music ceases that is the voice , or i am much deceived , of portia .
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo , by the bad voice .
dear lady , welcome home .
we have been praying for our husbands ' healths , which speed , we hope , the better for our words .
are they return ?
madam , they are not yet , but there is come a messenger before , to signify their coming .
go in , nerissa , give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence , nor you , lorenzo , jessica , nor you .
a tucket sounds your husband is at hand , i hear his trumpet we are no , madam , fear you not .
this night methinks is but the daylight sick , it looks a little paler is a day , such as the day is when the sun is hid .
enter bassanio , antonio , gratiano , and their followers we should hold day with the antipodes , if you would walk in absence of the sun .
let me give light , but let me not be light , for a light wife doth make a heavy husband , and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all !
you are welcome home , my lord .
i thank you , madam .
give welcome to my friend .
this is the man , this is antonio , to whom i am so infinitely bound .
you should in all sense be much bound to him .
for , as i hear , he was much bound for you .
no more than i am well acquitted of .
sir , you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words , therefore i scant this breathing courtesy .
to nerissa by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong , in faith , i gave it to the judge clerk would he were gelt that had it , for my part , since you do take it , love , so much at heart .
a quarrel , ho , already !
what the matter ?
about a hoop of gold , a paltry ring that she did give me , whose posy was for all the world like cutler poetry upon a knife , me , and leave me not . '
what talk you of the posy or the value ?
you swore to me , when i did give it you , that you would wear it till your hour of death and that it should lie with you in your grave though not for me , yet for your vehement oaths , you should have been respective and have kept it .
gave it a judge clerk !
no , god my judge , the clerk will wear hair on face that had it .
he will , an if he live to be a man .
ay , if a woman live to be a man .
now , by this hand , i gave it to a youth , a kind of boy , a little scrubbed boy , no higher than thyself , the judge clerk , a prating boy , that begg it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him .
you were to blame , i must be plain with you , to part so slightly with your wife first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh .
i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it , and here he stands , i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger , for the wealth that the world masters .
now , in faith , gratiano , you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an to me , i should be mad at it .
aside why , i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it .
my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that begg it and indeed deserved it too , and then the boy , his clerk , that took some pains in writing , he begg mine , and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings .
what ring gave you my lord ?
not that , i hope , which you received of me .
if i could add a lie unto a fault , i would deny it , but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it , it is gone .
even so void is your false heart of truth .
by heaven , i will come in your bed until i see the ring .
nor i in yours till i again see mine .
sweet portia , if you did know to whom i gave the ring , if you did know for whom i gave the ring and would conceive for what i gave the ring and how unwillingly i left the ring , when nought would be accepted but the ring , you would abate the strength of your displeasure .
if you had known the virtue of the ring , or half her worthiness that gave the ring , or your own honour to contain the ring , you would not then have parted with the ring .
what man is there so much unreasonable , if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal , wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony ?
nerissa teaches me what to believe i die but some woman had the ring .
no , by my honour , madam , by my soul , no woman had it , but a civil doctor , which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and begg the ring , the which i did deny him and suffer him to go displeased away , even he that did uphold the very life of my dear friend .
what should i say , sweet lady ?
i was enforced to send it after him , i was beset with shame and courtesy , my honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it .
pardon me , good lady , for , by these blessed candles of the night , had you been there , i think you would have begg the ring of me to give the worthy doctor .
let not that doctor come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved , and that which you did swear to keep for me , i will become as liberal as you , i not deny him any thing i have , no , not my body nor my husband bed know him i shall , i am well sure of it lie not a night from home , watch me like argus if you do not , if i be left alone , now , by mine honour , which is yet mine own , i have that doctor for my bedfellow .
and i his clerk , therefore be well advised how you do leave me to mine own protection .
well , do you so , let not me take him , then , for if i do , i mar the young clerk pen .
i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels .
sir , grieve not you , you are welcome notwithstanding .
portia , forgive me this enforced wrong , and , in the hearing of these many friends , i swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes , wherein i see myself mark you but that !
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself , in each eye , one swear by your double self , and there an oath of credit .
nay , but hear me pardon this fault , and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee .
i once did lend my body for his wealth , which , but for him that had your husband ring , had quite miscarried i dare be bound again , my soul upon the forfeit , that your lord will never more break faith advisedly .
then you shall be his surety .
give him this and bid him keep it better than the other .
here , lord bassanio , swear to keep this ring .
by heaven , it is the same i gave the doctor !
i had it of him pardon me , bassanio , for , by this ring , the doctor lay with me .
and pardon me , my gentle gratiano , for that same scrubbed boy , the doctor clerk , in lieu of this last night did lie with me .
why , this is like the mending of highways in summer , where the ways are fair enough what , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?
speak not so grossly .
you are all amazed here is a letter , read it at your leisure , it comes from padua , from bellario there you shall find that portia was the doctor , nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now return , i have not yet enter my house .
antonio , you are welcome , and i have better news in store for you than you expect unseal this letter soon , there you shall find three of your argosies are richly come to harbour suddenly you shall not know by what strange accident i chanced on this letter .
i am dumb .
were you the doctor and i knew you not ?
were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold ?
ay , but the clerk that never means to do it , unless he live until he be a man .
sweet doctor , you shall be my when i am absent , then lie with my wife .
sweet lady , you have given me life and living , for here i read for certain that my ships are safely come to road .
how now , lorenzo !
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you .
ay , and i give them him without a fee .
there do i give to you and jessica , from the rich jew , a special deed of gift , after his death , of all he dies possess of .
fair ladies , you drop manna in the way of starved people .
it is almost morning , and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full .
let us go in , and charge us there upon , and we will answer all things faithfully .
let it be so the first that my nerissa shall be sworn on is , whether till the next night she had rather stay , or go to bed now , being two hours to day but were the day come , i should wish it dark , that i were couching with the doctor clerk .
well , while i live i fear no other thing so sore as keeping safe nerissa ring .

thou liest !
sir alice ford !
these knights will hack , and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry .
we burn daylight here , read , read , perceive how i might be knighted .
i shall think the worse of fat men , as long as i have an eye to make difference of men liking and yet he would not swear , praised women modesty , and gave such orderly and reproof to all uncomeliness , that i would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words , but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the hundredth psalm to the tune of sleeves . '
what tempest , i trow , threw this whale , with so many tuns of oil in his belly , ashore at windsor ?
how shall i be revenged on him ?
i think the best way were to entertain him with hope , till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease .
did you ever hear the like ?
letter for letter , but that the name of page and ford differs !
to thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions , here the of thy letter but let thine inherit first , for , i protest , mine never shall .
i warrant he hath a thousand of these letters , writ with blank space for different names sure , more , and these are of the second edition he will print them , out of doubt , for he cares not what he puts into the press , when he would put us two .
i had rather be a giantess , and lie under mount pelion .
well , i will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man .
why , this is the very same , the very hand , the very words .
what doth he think of us ?
nay , i know not it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty .
i entertain myself like one that i am not acquainted withal , for , sure , unless he know some strain in me , that i know not myself , he would never have boarded me in this fury .
, ' call you it ?
i be sure to keep him above deck .
so will i if he come under my hatches , i never to sea again .
let be revenged on him let appoint him a meeting , give him a show of comfort in his suit and lead him on with a delay , till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the garter .
nay , i will consent to act any villany against him , that may not sully the chariness of our honesty .
o , that my husband saw this letter !
it would give eternal food to his jealousy .
why , look where he comes , and my good man too he as far from jealousy as i am from giving him cause , and that i hope is an unmeasurable distance .
you are the happier woman .

yes and you heard what the other told me ?

i do not think the knight would offer it but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men , very rogues , now they be out of service .
were they his men ?
marry , were they .
i like it never the better for that .
does he lie at the garter ?
ay , marry , does he .
if he should intend this voyage towards my wife , i would turn her loose to him , and what he gets more of her than sharp words , let it lie on my head .
i do not misdoubt my wife , but i would be loath to turn them together .
a man may be too confident i would have nothing lie on my head i can not be thus satisfied .
look where my ranting host of the garter comes there is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily .

ah , ha !
mistress ford and mistress page have i encompassed you ?
go to , via !
bardolph , with ford disguised bless you , sir !
and you , sir !
would you speak with me ?
i make bold to press with so little preparation upon you .
you welcome .
what your will ?
give us leave , drawer .
exit bardolph sir , i am a gentleman that have spent much , my name is brook .
good master brook , i desire more acquaintance of you .
good sir john , i sue for yours not to charge you , for i must let you understand i think myself in better plight for a lender than you are the which hath something embolden me to this unseasoned intrusion , for they say , if money go before , all ways do lie open .
money is a good soldier , sir , and will on .
troth , and i have a bag of money here troubles me if you will help to bear it , sir john , take all , or half , for easing me of the carriage .
sir , i know not how i may deserve to be your porter .
i will tell you , sir , if you will give me the hearing .
speak , good master brook i shall be glad to be your servant .
sir , i hear you are a scholar , i will be brief with you , and you have been a man long known to me , though i had never so good means , as desire , to make myself acquainted with you .
i shall discover a thing to you , wherein i must very much lay open mine own imperfection but , good sir john , as you have one eye upon my follies , as you hear them unfolded , turn another into the register of your own , that i may pass with a reproof the easier , sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender .
very well , sir , proceed .
there is a gentlewoman in this town , her husband name is ford .
well , sir .
i have long loved her , and , i protest to you , bestowed much on her , followed her with a doting observance , engrossed opportunities to meet her , fee every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her , not only bought many presents to give her , but have given largely to many to know what she would have given , briefly , i have pursued her as love hath pursued me , which hath been on the wing of all occasions .
but whatsoever i have merited , either in my mind or , in my means , meed , i am sure , i have received none , unless experience be a jewel that i have purchased at an infinite rate , and that hath taught me to say this like a shadow flies when substance love pursues , pursuing that that flies , and flying what pursues . '
have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands ?
never .
have you importuned her to such a purpose ?
never .
of what quality was your love , then ?
like a fair house built on another man ground , so that i have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where i erected it .
to what purpose have you unfolded this to me ?
when i have told you that , i have told you all .
some say , that though she appear honest to me , yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her .
now , sir john , here is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding , admirable discourse , of great admittance , authentic in your place and person , generally allowed for your many , , and learned preparations .
o , sir !
believe it , for you know it .
there is money , spend it , spend it , spend more , spend all i have , only give me so much of your time in exchange of it , as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this ford wife use your art of wooing , win her to consent to you if any man may , you may as soon as any .
would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection , that i should win what you would enjoy ?
methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously .
o , understand my drift .
she dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour , that the folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too bright to be looked against .
now , could i could come to her with any detection in my hand , my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves i could drive her then from the ward of her purity , her reputation , her , and a thousand other her defences , which now are too too strongly embattled against me .
what say you , sir john ?
master brook , i will first make bold with your money , next , give me your hand , and last , as i am a gentleman , you shall , if you will , enjoy ford wife .
o good sir !
i say you shall .
want no money , sir john , you shall want none .
want no mistress ford , master brook , you shall want none .
i shall be with her , i may tell you , by her own appointment , even as you came in to me , her assistant or parted from me i say i shall be with her between ten and eleven , for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth .
come you to me at night , you shall know how i speed .
i am blest in your acquaintance .
do you know ford , sir ?
hang him , poor cuckoldly knave !
i know him not yet i wrong him to call him poor , they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money , for the which his wife seems to me .
i will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue coffer , and there my .
i would you knew ford , sir , that you might avoid him if you saw him .
hang him , mechanical rogue !
i will stare him out of his wits , i will awe him with my cudgel it shall hang like a meteor the cuckold horns .
master brook , thou shalt know i will predominate over the peasant , and thou shalt lie with his wife .
come to me soon at night .
ford a knave , and i will aggravate his style , thou , master brook , shalt know him for knave and cuckold .
come to me soon at night .
exit what a damned epicurean rascal is this !
my heart is ready to crack with impatience .
who says this is improvident jealousy ?
my wife hath sent to him , the hour is fixed , the match is made .
would any man have thought this ?
see the hell of having a false woman !
my bed shall be abused , my coffers ransacked , my reputation gnawn at , and i shall not only receive this villanous wrong , but stand under the adoption of abominable terms , and by him that does me this wrong .
terms !
names !
amaimon sounds well , lucifer , well , barbason , well , yet they are devils ' additions , the names of fiends but cuckold !
wittol ! cuckold !
the devil himself hath not such a name .
page is an ass , a secure ass he will trust his wife , he will not be jealous .
i will rather trust a fleming with my butter , parson hugh the welshman with my cheese , an irishman with my bottle , or a thief to walk my ambling gelding , than my wife with herself , then she plots , then she ruminates , then she devises , and what they think in their hearts they may effect , they will break their hearts but they will effect .
god be praised for my jealousy !
eleven the hour .
i will prevent this , detect my wife , be revenged on falstaff , and laugh at page .
i will about it , better three hours too soon than a minute too late .
fie , fie , fie !
cuckold !
cuckold !

i think my husband hath some special suspicion of falstaff being here , for i never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now .
i will lay a plot to try that , and we will yet have more tricks with falstaff his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine .
shall we send that foolish carrion , mistress quickly , to him , and excuse his throwing into the water , and give him another hope , to betray him to another punishment ?

how so , sir ?
did she change her determination ?
no , master brook , but the peaking cornuto her husband , master brook , dwelling in a continual of jealousy , comes me in the instant of our encounter , after we had embraced , kissed , protested , and , as it were , spoke the prologue of our comedy , and at his heels a rabble of his companions , thither provoked and instigated by his distemper , and , forsooth , to search his house for his wife love .
what , while you were there ?
while i was there .
and did he search for you , and could not find you ?
you shall hear .
as good luck would have it , comes in one mistress page , gives intelligence of ford approach , and , in her invention and ford wife distraction , they conveyed me into a .

rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks , socks , foul stockings , greasy napkins , that , master brook , there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril .
and how long lay you there ?
nay , you shall hear , master brook , what i have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good .
being thus crammed in the basket , a couple of ford knaves , his hinds , were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to they took me on their shoulders , met the jealous knave their master in the door , who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket i quaked for fear , lest the lunatic knave would have searched it , but fate , ordaining he should be a cuckold , held his hand .
well on went he for a search , and away went i for foul clothes .
but mark the sequel , master brook i suffered the pangs of three several deaths , first , an intolerable fright , to be detected with a jealous rotten , next , to be compassed , like a good bilbo , in the circumference of a peck , hilt to point , heel to head , and then , to be stopped in , like a strong distillation , with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that , a man of my kidney , think of that , that am as subject to heat as butter , a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation .
and in the height of this bath , when i was more than half stewed in grease , like a dutch dish , to be thrown into the thames , and cooled , glowing hot , in that surge , like a , think of that , hissing hot , think of that , master brook .
in good sadness , i am sorry that for my sake you have sufferd all this .
my suit then is desperate , you undertake her no more ?
master brook , i will be thrown into etna , as i have been into thames , ere i will leave her thus .
her husband is this morning gone i have received from her another embassy of meeting , eight and nine is the hour , master brook .
is past eight already , sir .
is it ?
i will then address me to my appointment .
come to me at your convenient leisure , and you shall know how i speed , and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her .

what think you ?
may we , with the warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience , pursue him with any further revenge ?
the spirit of wantonness is , sure , scared out of him if the devil have him not in , with fine and recovery , he will never , i think , in the way of waste , attempt us again .
shall we tell our husbands how we have served him ?
yes , by all means , if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband brains .

henceforth do what thou wilt , i rather will suspect the sun with cold than thee with wantonness now doth thy honour stand in him that was of late an heretic , as firm as faith .
is well , is well , no more be not as extreme in submission as in offence .
but let our plot go forward let our wives yet once again , to make us public sport , appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow , where we may take him and disgrace him for it .
there is no better way than that they spoke of .
how ?
to send him word they meet him in the park at midnight ?
fie , fie !
he never come .
you say he has been thrown in the rivers and has been grievously peaten as an old methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come , methinks his flesh is punished , he shall have no desires .
so think i too .
devise but how you use him when he comes , and let us two devise to bring him thither .
there is an old tale goes that herne the hunter , sometime a keeper here in windsor forest , doth all the , at still midnight , walk round about an oak , with great ragg horns , and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle and makes yield blood and shakes a chain in a most hideous and dreadful manner you have heard of such a spirit , and well you know the superstitious eld received and did deliver to our age this tale of herne the hunter for a truth .
why , yet there want not many that do fear in deep of night to walk by this herne oak but what of this ?
marry , this is our device , that falstaff at that oak shall meet with us .
well , let it not be doubted but he come and in this shape when you have brought him thither , what shall be done with him ?
what is your plot ?
that likewise have we thought upon , and thus nan page my daughter and my little son and three or four more of their growth we dress like urchins , ouphes and fairies , green and white , with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads , and rattles in their hands upon a sudden , as falstaff , she and i , are newly met , let them from forth a sawpit rush at once with some diffused song upon their sight , we two in great amazedness will fly then let them all encircle him about and , , the unclean knight , and ask him why , that hour of fairy revel , in their so sacred paths he dares to tread in shape profane .
and till he tell the truth , let the supposed fairies pinch him sound and burn him with their tapers .
the truth being known , we all present ourselves , the spirit , and mock him home to windsor .
the children must be practised well to this , or they .
i will teach the children their behaviors , and i will be like a also , to burn the knight with my taber .
that will be excellent .
i go and buy them vizards .
my nan shall be the queen of all the fairies , finely attired in a robe of white .
that silk will i go buy .
aside and in that time shall master slender steal my nan away and marry her at eton .

and have not they suffered ?
yes , i warrant , speciously one of them , mistress ford , good heart , is beaten black and blue , that you can not see a white spot about her .
what tellest thou me of black and blue ?
i was beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow , and i was like to be apprehended for the witch of brentford but that my admirable dexterity of wit , my counterfeiting the action of an old woman , delivered me , the knave constable had set me i ' the stocks , i ' the common stocks , for a witch .

now , thus it rests her father means she shall be all in white , and in that habit , when slender sees his time to take her by the hand and bid her go , she shall go with him her mother hath intended , the better to denote her to the doctor , for they must all be mask and vizarded , that quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed , with ribands pendent , flaring her head , and when the doctor spies his vantage ripe , to pinch her by the hand , and , on that token , the maid hath given consent to go with him .
which means she to deceive , father or mother ?

fie on lust and luxury !
lust is but a bloody fire , kindled with unchaste desire , fed in heart , whose flames aspire as thoughts do blow them , higher and higher .
pinch him , fairies , mutually , pinch him for his villany , pinch him , and burn him , and turn him about , till candles and starlight and moonshine be out .
during this song they pinch falstaff .
doctor caius comes one way , and steals away a boy in green , slender another way , and takes off a boy in white , and fenton comes and steals away ann page .
a noise of hunting is heard within .
all the fairies run away .
falstaff pulls off his buck head , and rises enter page , ford , mistress page , and mistress ford nay , do not fly , i think we have watch you now will none but herne the hunter serve your turn ?
i pray you , come , hold up the jest no higher now , good sir john , how like you windsor wives ?

do not these fair yokes become the forest better than the town ?
now , sir , who a cuckold now ?
master brook , falstaff a knave , a cuckoldly knave , here are his horns , master brook and , master brook , he hath enjoyed nothing of ford but his , his cudgel , and twenty pounds of money , which must be paid to master brook , his horses are arrested for it , master brook .
sir john , we have had ill luck , we could never meet .
i will never take you for my love again , but i will always count you my deer .
i do begin to perceive that i am made an ass .
ay , and an ox too both the proofs are extant .
and these are not fairies ?
i was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the guiltiness of my mind , the sudden surprise of my powers , drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief , in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason , that they were fairies .
see now how wit may be made a , when is upon ill employment !
sir john falstaff , serve got , and leave your desires , and fairies will not pinse you .
well said , fairy hugh .
and leave your jealousies too , i pray you .
i will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good english .
have i laid my brain in the sun and dried it , that it wants matter to prevent so gross as this ?
am i ridden with a welsh goat too ?
shall i have a coxcomb of frize ?
is time i were choked with a piece of toasted cheese .
seese is not good to give putter , your belly is all putter .
' and ' !
have i lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of english ?
this is enough to be the decay of lust and through the realm .
why sir john , do you think , though we would have the virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell , that ever the devil could have made you our delight ?
what , a ?
a bag of flax ?
a puffed man ?
old , cold , withered and of intolerable entrails ?
and one that is as slanderous as satan ?
and as poor as job ?
and as wicked as his wife ?
and given to fornications , and to taverns and sack and wine and metheglins , and to drinkings and swearings and starings , pribbles and prabbles ?
well , i am your theme you have the start of me , i am dejected , i am not able to answer the welsh flannel , ignorance itself is a plummet me use me as you will .
marry , sir , we bring you to windsor , to one master brook , that you have cozened of money , to whom you should have been a pander over and above that you have suffered , i think to repay that money will be a biting affliction .
yet be cheerful , knight thou shalt eat a posset at my house , where i will desire thee to laugh at my wife , that now laughs at thee tell her master slender hath married her daughter .
aside doctors doubt that if anne page be my daughter , she is , by this , doctor caius ' wife .
enter slender whoa ho !
ho , father page !

how now , son !
have you dispatched ?
dispatched !
i make the best in gloucestershire know o , would i were hanged , la , else .
of what , son ?
i came yonder at eton to marry mistress anne page , and she a great lubberly boy .
if it had not been i ' the church , i would have swinged him , or he should have swinged me .
if i did not think it had been anne page , would i might never stir ! and is a postmaster boy .
upon my life , then , you took the wrong .
what need you tell me that ?
i think so , when i took a boy for a girl .
if i had been married to him , for all he was in woman apparel , i would not have had him .
why , this is your own folly .
did not i tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments ?
i went to her in white , and cried , ' and she cried , ' as anne and i had appointed , and yet it was not anne , but a postmaster boy .
good george , be not angry i knew of your purpose , turned my daughter into green , and , indeed , she is now with the doctor at the deanery , and there married .
enter doctor caius vere is mistress page ?
by gar , i am cozened i ha ' married un garcon , a boy , un paysan , by gar , a boy , it is not anne page by gar , i am cozened .
why , did you take her in green ?
ay , by gar , and is a boy by gar , i raise all windsor .
exit this is strange .
who hath got the right anne ?
my heart misgives me here comes master fenton .
enter fenton and anne page how now , master fenton !
pardon , good father !
good my mother , pardon !
now , mistress , how chance you went not with master slender ?
why went you not with master doctor , maid ?
you do amaze her hear the truth of it .
you would have married her most shamefully , where there was no proportion held in love .
the truth is , she and i , long since contracted , are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us .
the offence is holy that she hath committed , and this deceit loses the name of craft , of disobedience , or unduteous title , since therein she doth evitate and shun a thousand irreligious cursed hours , which forced marriage would have brought upon her .
stand not amazed , here is no remedy in love the heavens themselves do guide the state , money buys lands , and wives are sold by fate .
i am glad , though you have a special stand to strike at me , that your arrow hath glanced .
well , what remedy ?
fenton , heaven give thee joy !
what can not be eschew must be embraced .
when run , all sorts of deer are chased .
well , i will muse no further .
master fenton , heaven give you many , many merry days !
good husband , let us every one go home , and laugh this sport by a country fire , sir john and all .
let it be so .
sir john , to master brook you yet shall hold your word for he tonight shall lie with mistress ford .

the palace of theseus .
enter theseus , hippolyta , philostrate , and attendants now , fair hippolyta , our nuptial hour draws on apace , four happy days bring in another moon but , o , methinks , how slow this old moon wanes !
she lingers my desires , like to a or a dowager long withering out a young man revenue .
four days will quickly steep themselves in night , four nights will quickly dream away the time , and then the moon , like to a silver bow in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities .
go , philostrate , stir up the athenian youth to merriments , awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth , turn melancholy forth to funerals , the pale companion is not for our pomp .
exit philostrate hippolyta , i woo thee with my sword , and won thy love , doing thee injuries , but i will wed thee in another key , with pomp , with triumph and with revelling .
enter egeus , hermia , lysander , and demetrius happy be theseus , our renowned duke !
thanks , good egeus what the news with thee ?
full of vexation come i , with complaint against my child , my daughter hermia .
stand forth , demetrius .
my noble lord , this man hath my consent to marry her .
stand forth , lysander and my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch the bosom of my child , thou , thou , lysander , thou hast given her rhymes , and interchanged with my child thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice verses of feigning love , and stolen the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair , rings , gawds , conceits , knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , messengers of strong prevailment in unharden youth with cunning hast thou filch my daughter heart , turn her obedience , which is due to me , to stubborn harshness and , my gracious duke , be it so she , will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , as she is mine , i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death , according to our law immediately provided in that case .
what say you , hermia ?
be advised fair maid to you your father should be as a god , one that composed your beauties , yea , and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it .
demetrius is a worthy gentleman .
so is lysander .
in himself he is , but in this kind , wanting your father voice , the other must be held the worthier .
i would my father look but with my eyes .
rather your eyes must with his judgment look .
i do entreat your grace to pardon me .
i know not by what power i am made bold , nor how it may concern my modesty , in such a presence here to plead my thoughts , but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case , if i refuse to wed demetrius .
either to die the death or to abjure for ever the society of men .
therefore , fair hermia , question your desires , know of your youth , examine well your blood , whether , if you yield not to your father choice , you can endure the livery of a nun , for aye to be in shady cloister mew , to live a barren sister all your life , chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon .
they that master so their blood , to undergo such maiden pilgrimage , but earthlier happy is the rose distill , than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows , lives and dies in single blessedness .
so will i grow , so live , so die , my lord , ere i will my virgin patent up unto his lordship , whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty .
take time to pause , and , by the nest new moon the betwixt my love and me , for everlasting bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father will , or else to wed demetrius , as he would , or on diana altar to protest for aye austerity and single life .
relent , sweet hermia and , lysander , yield thy crazed title to my certain right .
you have her father love , demetrius , let me have hermia do you marry him .
scornful lysander !
true , he hath my love , and what is mine my love shall render him .
and she is mine , and all my right of her i do estate unto demetrius .
i am , my lord , as well derived as he , as well possess , my love is more than his , my fortunes every way as fairly rank , if not with vantage , as demetrius ' , and , which is more than all these boasts can be , i am beloved of beauteous hermia why should not i then prosecute my right ?
demetrius , i avouch it to his head , made love to nedar daughter , helena , and won her soul , and she , sweet lady , dotes , devoutly dotes , dotes in idolatry , upon this spotted and inconstant man .
i must confess that i have heard so much , and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof , but , being of , my mind did lose it .
but , demetrius , come , and come , egeus , you shall go with me , i have some private schooling for you both .
for you , fair hermia , look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father will , or else the law of athens yields you up which by no means we may extenuate to death , or to a vow of single life .
come , my hippolyta what cheer , my love ?
demetrius and egeus , go along i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
with duty and desire we follow you .
exeunt all but lysander and hermia how now , my love !
why is your cheek so pale ?
how chance the roses there do fade so fast ?
belike for want of rain , which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
ay me !
for aught that i could ever read , could ever hear by tale or history , the course of true love never did run smooth , but , either it was different in blood , o cross !
too high to be enthrall to low .
or else misgraffed in respect of years , o spite !
too old to be engaged to young .
or else it stood upon the choice of friends , o hell !
to choose love by another eyes .
or , if there were a sympathy in choice , war , death , or sickness did lay siege to it , making it momentany as a sound , swift as a shadow , short as any dream , brief as the lightning in the collied night , that , in a spleen , unfolds both heaven and earth , and ere a man hath power to say ! '
the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion .
if then true lovers have been ever cross , it stands as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience , because it is a customary cross , as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs , wishes and tears , poor fancy followers .
a good persuasion therefore , hear me , hermia .
i have a widow aunt , a dowager of great revenue , and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven leagues , and she respects me as her only son .
there , gentle hermia , may i marry thee , and to that place the sharp athenian law can not pursue us .
if thou lovest me then , steal forth thy father house night , and in the wood , a league without the town , where i did meet thee once with helena , to do observance to a morn of may , there will i stay for thee .
my good lysander !
i swear to thee , by cupid strongest bow , by his best arrow with the golden head , by the simplicity of venus ' doves , by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves , and by that fire which burn the carthage queen , when the false troyan under sail was seen , by all the vows that ever men have broke , in number more than ever women spoke , in that same place thou hast appointed me , truly will i meet with thee .
keep promise , love .
look , here comes helena .
enter helena god speed fair helena !
whither away ?
call you me fair ?
that fair again unsay .
demetrius loves your fair o happy fair !
your eyes are , and your tongue sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherd ear , when wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear .
sickness is catching o , were favour so , yours would i catch , fair hermia , ere i go , my ear should catch your voice , my eye your eye , my tongue should catch your tongue sweet melody .
were the world mine , demetrius being bated , the rest i give to be to you translated .
o , teach me how you look , and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius ' heart .
i frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !
i give him curses , yet he gives me love .
o that my prayers could such affection move !
the more i hate , the more he follows me .
the more i love , the more he hateth me .
his folly , helena , is no fault of mine .
none , but your beauty would that fault were mine !
take comfort he no more shall see my face , lysander and myself will fly this place .
before the time i did lysander see , seem athens as a paradise to me o , then , what graces in my love do dwell , that he hath turn a heaven unto a hell !
helen , to you our minds we will unfold night , when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass , decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass , a time that lovers ' flights doth still conceal , through athens ' gates have we devised to steal .
and in the wood , where often you and i upon faint were wont to lie , emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet , there my lysander and myself shall meet , and thence from athens turn away our eyes , to seek new friends and stranger companies .
farewell , sweet playfellow pray thou for us , and good luck grant thee thy demetrius !
keep word , lysander we must starve our sight from lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight .
i will , my hermia .
exit hermia helena , adieu as you on him , demetrius dote on you !
exit how happy some other some can be !
through athens i am thought as fair as she .
but what of that ?
demetrius thinks not so , he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs , doting on hermia eyes , so i , admiring of his qualities things base and vile , folding no quantity , love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes , but with the mind , and therefore is wing cupid painted blind nor hath love mind of any judgement taste , wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child , because in choice he is so oft beguiled .
as waggish boys in game themselves forswear , so the boy love is perjured every where for ere demetrius look on hermia eyne , he hail down oaths that he was only mine , and when this hail some heat from hermia felt , so he dissolved , and showers of oaths did melt .
i will go tell him of fair hermia flight then to the wood will he night pursue her , and for this intelligence if i have thanks , it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my pain , to have his sight thither and back again .
exit scene ii .
athens .
quince house .
enter quince , snug , bottom , flute , snout , and starveling is all our company here ?
you were best to call them generally , man by man , according to the scrip .
here is the scroll of every man name , which is thought fit , through all athens , to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess , on his at night .
first , good peter quince , say what the play treats on , then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point .
marry , our play is , the most lamentable comedy , and most cruel death of pyramus and thisby .
a very good piece of work , i assure you , and a merry .
now , good peter quince , call forth your actors by the scroll .
masters , spread yourselves .
answer as i call you .
nick bottom , the weaver .
ready .
name what part i am for , and proceed .
you , nick bottom , are set down for pyramus .
what is pyramus ?
a lover , or a tyrant ?
a lover , that kills himself most gallant for love .
that will ask some tears in the true performing of it if i do it , let the audience look to their eyes , i will move storms , i will condole in some measure .
to the rest yet my chief humour is for a tyrant i could play ercles rarely , or a part to tear a cat in , to make all split .
the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates , and phibbus ' car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish fates .
this was lofty !
now name the rest of the players .
this is ercles ' vein , a tyrant vein , a lover is more condoling .
francis flute , the .
here , peter quince .
flute , you must take thisby on you .
what is thisby ?
a wandering knight ?
it is the lady that pyramus must love .
nay , faith , let me not play a woman , i have a beard coming .
that all one you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
an i may hide my face , let me play thisby too , i speak in a monstrous little voice .
, thisne , ' , pyramus , lover dear !
thy thisby dear , and lady dear ! '
no , no , you must play pyramus and , flute , you thisby .
well , proceed .
robin starveling , the tailor .
here , peter quince .
robin starveling , you must play thisby mother .
tom snout , the tinker .
here , peter quince .
you , pyramus ' father myself , thisby father snug , the joiner , you , the lion part and , i hope , here is a play fitted .
have you the lion part written ?
pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study .
you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring .
let me play the lion too i will roar , that i will do any man heart good to hear me , i will roar , that i will make the duke say him roar again , let him roar again . '
an you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek , and that were enough to hang us all .
that would hang us , every mother son .
i grant you , friends , if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits , they would have no more discretion but to hang us but i will aggravate my voice so that i will roar you as gently as any sucking dove , i will roar you an any nightingale .
you can play no part but pyramus , for pyramus is a man , a proper man , as one shall see in a summer day , a most lovely man therefore you must needs play pyramus .
well , i will undertake it .
what beard were i best to play it in ?
why , what you will .
i will discharge it in either your beard , your beard , your beard , or your beard , your perfect yellow .
some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play .
but , masters , here are your parts and i am to entreat you , request you and desire you , to con them by night , and meet me in the palace wood , a mile without the town , by moonlight , there will we rehearse , for if we meet in the city , we shall be dogged with company , and our devices known .
in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties , such as our play wants .
i pray you , fail me not .
we will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .
take pains , be perfect adieu .
at the duke oak we meet .
enough , hold or cut .
exeunt act ii scene i .
a wood near athens .
enter , from opposite sides , a fairy , and puck how now , spirit !
whither wander you ?
over hill , over dale , thorough bush , thorough brier , over park , over pale , thorough flood , thorough fire , i do wander everywhere , swifter than the moon sphere , and i serve the fairy queen , to dew her orbs upon the green .
the cowslips tall her pensioners be in their gold coats spots you see , those be rubies , fairy favours , in those freckles live their savours i must go seek some dewdrops here and hang a pearl in every cowslip ear .
farewell , thou lob of spirits , i be gone our queen and all our elves come here anon .
the king doth keep his revels here take heed the queen come not within his sight , for oberon is passing fell and wrath , because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy , stolen from an indian king , she never had so sweet a changeling , and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild , but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , but , they do square , that all their elves for fear creep into and hide them there .
either i mistake your shape and making quite , or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite call robin goodfellow are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery , skim milk , and sometimes labour in the quern and bootless make the breathless housewife churn , and sometime make the drink to bear no barm , mislead , laughing at their harm ?
those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck , you do their work , and they shall have good luck are not you he ?
thou aright , i am that merry wanderer of the night .
i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossip bowl , in very likeness of a roasted crab , and when she drinks , against her lips i bob and on her wither dewlap pour the ale .
the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , sometime for stool mistaketh me , then slip i from her bum , down topples she , and ' cries , and falls into a cough , and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh , and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there .
but , room , fairy !
here comes oberon .
and here my mistress .
would that he were gone !
enter , from one side , oberon , with his train , from the other , titania , with hers ill met by moonlight , proud titania .
what , jealous oberon !
fairies , skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company .
tarry , rash wanton am not i thy lord ?
then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairy land , and in the shape of corin sat all day , playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida .
why art thou here , come from the farthest steppe of india ?
but that , forsooth , the bouncing amazon , your buskin mistress and your warrior love , to theseus must be wedded , and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity .
how canst thou thus for shame , titania , glance at my credit with hippolyta , knowing i know thy love to theseus ?
didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia , whom he ravished ?
and make him with fair aegle break his faith , with ariadne and antiopa ?
these are the forgeries of jealousy and never , since the middle summer spring , met we on hill , in dale , forest or mead , by paved fountain or by rushy brook , or in the beached margent of the sea , to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , but with thy brawls thou hast disturb our sport .
therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck up from the sea contagious fogs , which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents the ox hath therefore stretch his yoke in vain , the ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain a beard , the fold stands empty in the drowned field , and crows are fatted with the murrion flock , the nine men morris is fill up with mud , and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable the human mortals want their winter here , no night is now with hymn or carol blest therefore the moon , the governess of floods , pale in her anger , washes all the air , that rheumatic diseases do abound and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter frosts far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose , and on old hiems ' thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is , as in mockery , set the spring , the summer , the childing autumn , angry winter , change their wonted liveries , and the mazed world , by their increase , now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate , from our dissension , we are their parents and original .
do you amend it then , it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon ?
i do but beg a little changeling boy , to be my henchman .
set your heart at rest the fairy land buys not the child of me .
his mother was a votaress of my order and , in the spiced indian air , by night , full often hath she gossip by my side , and sat with me on neptune yellow sands , marking the embarked traders on the flood , when we have laugh to see the sails conceive and grow with the wanton wind , which she , with pretty and with swimming gait following , her womb then rich with my young squire , would imitate , and sail upon the land , to fetch me trifles , and return again , as from a voyage , rich with merchandise .
but she , being mortal , of that boy did die , and for her sake do i rear up her boy , and for her sake i will not part with him .
how long within this wood intend you stay ?
perchance till after theseus ' .
if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels , go with us , if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts .
give me that boy , and i will go with thee .
not for thy fairy kingdom .
fairies , away !
we shall chide downright , if i longer stay .
exit titania with her train well , go thy way thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury .
my gentle puck , come hither .
thou rememberest since once i sat upon a promontory , and heard a mermaid on a dolphin back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres , to hear the music .
i remember .
that very time i saw , but thou couldst not , flying between the cold moon and the earth , cupid all arm a certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west , and loosed his smartly from his bow , as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts , but i might see young cupid fiery shaft quench in the chaste beams of the watery moon , and the imperial votaress passed on , in maiden meditation , .
yet mark i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower , before , now purple with love wound , and maidens call it .
fetch me that flower , the herb i shew thee once the juice of it on sleeping laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees .
fetch me this herb , and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league .
i put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes .
exit having once this juice , i watch titania when she is asleep , and drop the liquor of it in her eyes .
the next thing then she waking looks upon , be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , on meddling monkey , or on busy ape , she shall pursue it with the soul of love and ere i take this charm from off her sight , as i can take it with another herb , i make her render up her page to me .
but who comes here ?
i am invisible , and i will overhear their conference .
enter demetrius , helena , following him i love thee not , therefore pursue me not .
where is lysander and fair hermia ?
the one i slay , the other slayeth me .
thou me they were stolen unto this wood , and here am i , and wode within this wood , because i can not meet my hermia .
hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
you draw me , you adamant , but yet you draw not iron , for my heart is true as steel leave you your power to draw , and i shall have no power to follow you .
do i entice you ?
do i speak you fair ?
or , rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you , i do not , nor i can not love you ?
and even for that do i love you the more .
i am your spaniel , and , demetrius , the more you beat me , i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , neglect me , lose me , only give me leave , unworthy as i am , to follow you .
what worser place can i beg in your love , and yet a place of high respect with me , than to be used as you use your dog ?
tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit , for i am sick when i do look on thee .
and i am sick when i look not on you .
you do impeach your modesty too much , to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not , to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity .
your virtue is my privilege for that it is not night when i do see your face , therefore i think i am not in the night , nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , for you in my respect are all the world then how can it be said i am alone , when all the world is here to look on me ?
i run from thee and hide me in the brakes , and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
the wildest hath not such a heart as you .
run when you will , the story shall be changed apollo flies , and daphne holds the chase , the dove pursues the griffin , the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger , bootless speed , when cowardice pursues and valour flies .
i will not stay thy questions , let me go or , if thou follow me , do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood .
ay , in the temple , in the town , the field , you do me mischief .
fie , demetrius !
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex we can not fight for love , as men may do , we should be wood and were not made to woo .
exit demetrius i follow thee and make a heaven of hell , to die upon the hand i love so well .
exit fare thee well , nymph ere he do leave this grove , thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love .
puck hast thou the flower there ?
welcome , wanderer .
ay , there it is .
i pray thee , give it me .
i know a bank where the wild thyme blows , where oxlips and the nodding violet grows , quite with luscious woodbine , with sweet and with eglantine there sleeps titania sometime of the night , lull in these flowers with dances and delight , and there the snake throws her enamell skin , weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in and with the juice of this i streak her eyes , and make her full of hateful fantasies .
take thou some of it , and seek through this grove a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes , but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on .
effect it with some care , that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow .
fear not , my lord , your servant shall do so .
exeunt scene ii .
another part of the wood .
enter titania , with her train come , now a roundel and a fairy song , then , for the third part of a minute , hence , some to kill cankers in the buds , some war with for their leathern wings , to make my small elves coats , and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits .
sing me now asleep , then to your offices and let me rest .
the fairies sing you spotted snakes with double tongue , thorny hedgehogs , be not seen , newts and , do no wrong , come not near our fairy queen .
philomel , with melody sing in our sweet lullaby , lulla , lulla , lullaby , lulla , lulla , lullaby never harm , nor spell nor charm , come our lovely lady nigh , so , good night , with lullaby .
weaving spiders , come not here , hence , you spinners , hence !
beetles black , approach not near , worm nor snail , do no offence .
philomel , with melody , and hence , away !
now all is well one aloof stand sentinel .
exeunt fairies .
titania sleeps enter oberon and squeezes the flower on titania eyelids what thou seest when thou dost wake , do it for thy take , love and languish for his sake be it ounce , or cat , or bear , pard , or boar with bristled hair , in thy eye that shall appear when thou wakest , it is thy dear wake when some vile thing is near .
exit enter lysander and hermia fair love , you faint with wandering in the wood , and to speak troth , i have forgot our way we rest us , hermia , if you think it good , and tarry for the comfort of the day .
be it so , lysander find you out a bed , for i upon this bank will rest my head .
one turf shall serve as pillow for us both , one heart , one bed , two bosoms and one troth .
nay , good lysander , for my sake , my dear , lie further off yet , do not lie so near .
o , take the sense , sweet , of my innocence !
love takes the meaning in love conference .
i mean , that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it , two bosoms interchained with an oath , so then two bosoms and a single troth .
then by your side no me deny , for lying so , hermia , i do not lie .
lysander riddles very prettily now much beshrew my manners and my pride , if hermia meant to say lysander lied .
but , gentle friend , for love and courtesy lie further off , in human modesty , such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid , so far be distant , and , good night , sweet friend thy love alter till thy sweet life end !
amen , amen , to that fair prayer , say i , and then end life when i end loyalty !
here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest !
with half that wish the wisher eyes be press !
they sleep enter puck through the forest have i gone .
but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve this flower force in stirring love .
night and who is here ?
weeds of athens he doth wear this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid , and here the maiden , sleeping sound , on the dank and dirty ground .
pretty soul !
she durst not lie near this , this .
churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe .
when thou wakest , let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid so awake when i am gone , for i must now to oberon .
exit enter demetrius and helena , running stay , though thou kill me , sweet demetrius .
i charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
o , wilt thou darkling leave me ?
do not so .
stay , on thy peril i alone will go .
exit o , i am out of breath in this fond chase !
the more my prayer , the lesser is my grace .
happy is hermia , she lies , for she hath blessed and attractive eyes .
how came her eyes so bright ?
not with salt tears if so , my eyes are oftener wash than hers .
no , no , i am as ugly as a bear , for beasts that meet me run away for fear therefore no marvel though demetrius do , as a monster fly my presence thus .
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia sphery eyne ?
but who is here ?
lysander !
on the ground !
dead ?
or asleep ?
i see no blood , no wound .
lysander if you live , good sir , awake .
awaking and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake .
transparent helena !
nature shows art , that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart .
where is demetrius ?
o , how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword !
do not say so , lysander , say not so what though he love your hermia ?
lord , what though ?
yet hermia still loves you then be content .
content with hermia !
no , i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent .
not hermia but helena i love who will not change a raven for a dove ?
the will of man is by his reason sway , and reason says you are the worthier maid .
things growing are not ripe until their season so i , being young , till now ripe not to reason , and touching now the point of human skill , reason becomes the marshal to my will and leads me to your eyes , where i love stories written in love richest book .
wherefore was i to this keen mockery born ?
when at your hands did i deserve this scorn ?
not enough , not enough , young man , that i did never , no , nor never can , deserve a sweet look from demetrius ' eye , but you must flout my insufficiency ?
good troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , in such disdainful manner me to woo .
but fare you well perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness .
o , that a lady , of one man refused .
should of another therefore be abused !
exit she sees not hermia .
hermia , sleep thou there and never mayst thou come lysander near !
for as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings , or as tie heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive , so thou , my surfeit and my heresy , of all be hated , but the most of me !
and , all my powers , address your love and might to honour helen and to be her knight !
exit awaking help me , lysander , help me !
do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast !
ay me , for pity !
what a dream was here !
lysander , look how i do quake with fear methought a serpent eat my heart away , and you sat smiling at his cruel pray .
lysander !
what , removed ?
lysander !
lord !
what , out of hearing ?
gone ?
no sound , no word ?
alack , where are you speak , an if you hear , speak , of all loves !
i swoon almost with fear .
no ?
then i well perceive you all not nigh either death or you i find immediately .
exit act iii scene i .
the wood .
titania lying asleep .
enter quince , snug , bottom , flute , snout , and starveling are we all met ?
pat , pat , and here a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal .
this green plot shall be our stage , this our , and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .
peter quince , what sayest thou , bully bottom ?
there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisby that will never please .
first , pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself , which the ladies can not abide .
how answer you that ?
by ' r lakin , a parlous fear .
i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .
not a whit i have a device to make all well .
write me a prologue , and let the prologue seem to say , we will do no harm with our swords , and that pyramus is not killed indeed , and , for the more better assurance , tell them that i , pyramus , am not pyramus , but bottom the weaver this will put them out of fear .
well , we will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .
no , make it two more , let it be written in eight and eight .
will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?
i fear it , i promise you .
masters , you ought to consider with yourselves to bring in god shield us ! a lion among ladies , is a most dreadful thing , for there is not a more fearful than your lion living , and we ought to look to .
therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .
nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion neck and he himself must speak through , saying thus , or to the same defect , , ' or i would wish you , ' or ' i would request you , ' or ' i would entreat you , not to fear , not to tremble my life for yours .
if you think i come hither as a lion , it were pity of my life no i am no such thing , i am a man as other men are , ' and there indeed let him name his name , and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner .
well it shall be so .
but there is two hard things , that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber , for , you know , pyramus and thisby meet by moonlight .
doth the moon shine that night we play our play ?
a calendar , a calendar !
look in the almanac , find out moonshine , find out moonshine .
yes , it doth shine that night .
why , then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window , where we play , open , and the moon may shine in at the casement .
ay , or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn , and say he comes to disfigure , or to present , the person of moonshine .
then , there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber , for pyramus and thisby says the story , did talk through the chink of a wall .
you can never bring in a wall .
what say you , bottom ?
some man or other must present wall and let him have some plaster , or some loam , or some about him , to signify wall , and let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisby whisper .
if that may be , then all is well .
come , sit down , every mother son , and rehearse your parts .
pyramus , you begin when you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake and so every one according to his cue .
enter puck behind what hempen have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ?
what , a play toward !
i be an auditor , an actor too , perhaps , if i see cause .
speak , pyramus .
thisby , stand forth .
thisby , the flowers of odious savours sweet , odours , odours .
odours savours sweet so hath thy breath , my dearest thisby dear .
but hark , a voice !
stay thou but here awhile , and by and by i will to thee appear .
exit a stranger pyramus than played here .
exit must i speak now ?
ay , marry , must you , for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again .
most radiant pyramus , most of hue , of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier , most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely jew , as true as truest horse that yet would never tire , i meet thee , pyramus , at ninny tomb .
' tomb , ' man why , you must not speak that yet , that you answer to pyramus you speak all your part at once , cues and all pyramus enter your cue is past , it is , tire . '
o , as true as truest horse , that yet would never tire .
puck , and bottom with an ass head if i were fair , thisby , i were only thine .
o monstrous !
o strange !
we are haunted .
pray , masters !
fly , masters !
help !
exeunt quince , snug , flute , snout , and starveling i follow you , i lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier sometime a horse i be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire , and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn .
exit why do they run away ?
this is a knavery of them to make me afeard .
snout o bottom , thou art changed !
what do i see on thee ?
what do you see ?
you see an asshead of your own , do you ?
exit snout quince bless thee , bottom !
bless thee !
thou art translated .
exit i see their knavery this is to make an ass of me , to fright me , if they could .
but i will not stir from this place , do what they can i will walk up and down here , and i will sing , that they shall hear i am not afraid .
sings the ousel cock so black of hue , with bill , the throstle with his note so true , the wren with little quill , awaking what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ?
sings the finch , the sparrow and the lark , the cuckoo gray , whose note full many a man doth mark , and dares not answer nay , for , indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ?
who would give a bird the lie , though he cry ' never so ?
i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again mine ear is much enamour of thy note , so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape , and thy fair virtue force perforce doth move me on the first view to say , to swear , i love thee .
methinks , mistress , you should have little reason for that and yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together , the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends .
nay , i can gleek upon occasion .
thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
not so , neither but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood , i have enough to serve mine own turn .
out of this wood do not desire to go thou shalt remain here , whether thou wilt or no .
i am a spirit of no common rate , the summer still doth tend upon my state , and i do love thee therefore , go with me , i give thee fairies to attend on thee , and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep , and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep , and i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go .
peaseblossom !

and mustardseed !
enter peaseblossom , cobweb , moth , and mustardseed ready .
and i .
and i .
and i .
where shall we go ?
be kind and courteous to this gentleman , hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes , feed him with apricocks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries , the steal from the , and for crop their waxen thighs and light them at the fiery eyes , to have my love to bed and to arise , and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
hail , mortal !
hail !

i cry your worship mercy , heartily i beseech your worship name .

i shall desire you of more acquaintance , good master cobweb if i cut my finger , i shall make bold with you .
your name , honest gentleman ?
peaseblossom .
i pray you , commend me to mistress squash , your mother , and to master peascod , your father .
good master peaseblossom , i shall desire you of more acquaintance too .
your name , i beseech you , sir ?
mustardseed .
good master mustardseed , i know your patience well that same cowardly , hath devoured many a gentleman of your house i promise you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now .
i desire your more acquaintance , good master mustardseed .
come , wait upon him , lead him to my bower .
the moon methinks looks with a watery eye , and when she weeps , weeps every little flower , lamenting some enforced chastity .
tie up my love tongue bring him silently .
exeunt scene ii .
another part of the wood .
enter oberon i wonder if titania be awaked , then , what it was that next came in her eye , which she must dote on in extremity .
enter puck here comes my messenger .
how now , mad spirit !
what now about this haunted grove ?
my mistress with a monster is in love .
near to her close and consecrated bower , while she was in her dull and sleeping hour , a crew of patches , rude mechanicals , that work for bread upon athenian stalls , were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus ' .
the shallowest of that barren sort , who pyramus presented , in their sport forsook his scene and enter in a brake when i did him at this advantage take , an ass nole i fixed on his head anon his thisbe must be answered , and forth my mimic comes .
when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , or choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , so , at his sight , away his fellows fly , and , at our stamp , here and one falls , he murder cries and help from athens calls .
their sense thus weak , lost with their fears thus strong , made senseless things begin to do them wrong , for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch , some sleeves , some hats , from yielders all things catch .
i led them on in this distracted fear , and left sweet pyramus translated there when in that moment , so it came to pass , titania waked and straightway loved an ass .
this falls out better than i could devise .
but hast thou yet latch the athenian eyes with the , as i did bid thee do ?
i took him sleeping , that is finish too , and the athenian woman by his side that , when he waked , of force she must be eyed .
enter hermia and demetrius stand close this is the same athenian .
this is the woman , but not this the man .
o , why rebuke you him that loves you so ?
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
now i but chide , but i should use thee worse , for thou , i fear , hast given me cause to curse , if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep , being shoes in blood , plunge in the deep , and kill me too .
the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me would he have stolen away from sleeping hermia ?
i believe as soon this whole earth may be bored and that the moon may through the centre creep and so displease her brother noontide with antipodes .
it can not be but thou hast murder him , so should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
so should the murder look , and so should i , pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere .
what this to my lysander ?
where is he ?
ah , good demetrius , wilt thou give him me ?
i had rather give his carcass to my hounds .
out , dog !
out , cur !
thou drivest me past the bounds of maiden patience .
hast thou slain him , then ?
henceforth be never number among men !
o , once tell true , tell true , even for my sake !
durst thou have look upon him being awake , and hast thou kill him sleeping ?
o brave touch !
could not a worm , an adder , do so much ?
an adder did it , for with doubler tongue than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .
you spend your passion on a misprised mood i am not guilty of lysander blood , nor is he dead , for aught that i can tell .
i pray thee , tell me then that he is well .
an if i could , what should i get therefore ?
a privilege never to see me more .
and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more , whether he be dead or no .
exit there is no following her in this fierce vein here therefore for a while i will remain .
so sorrow heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe which now in some slight measure it will pay , if for his tender here i make some stay .
lies down and sleeps what hast thou done ?
thou hast mistaken quite and laid the on some sight of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turn and not a false turn true .
then fate , that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath .
about the wood go swifter than the wind , and helena of athens look thou find all she is and pale of cheer , with sighs of love , that costs the fresh blood dear by some illusion see thou bring her here i charm his eyes against she do appear .
i go , i go , look how i go , swifter than arrow from the tartar bow .
exit flower of this purple dye , hit with cupid archery , sink in apple of his eye .
when his love he doth espy , let her shine as gloriously as the venus of the sky .
when thou wakest , if she be by , beg of her for remedy .
puck captain of our fairy band , helena is here at hand , and the youth , mistook by me , pleading for a lover fee .
shall we their fond pageant see ?
lord , what fools these mortals be !
stand aside the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake .
then will two at once woo one , that must needs be sport alone , and those things do best please me that befal preposterously .
enter lysander and helena why should you think that i should woo in scorn ?
scorn and derision never come in tears look , when i vow , i weep , and vows so born , in their nativity all truth appears .
how can these things in me seem scorn to you , bearing the badge of faith , to prove them true ?
you do advance your cunning more and more .
when truth kills truth , o fray !
these vows are hermia will you give her ?
weigh oath with oath , and you will nothing weigh your vows to her and me , put in two scales , will even weigh , and both as light as tales .
i had no judgment when to her i swore .
nor none , in my mind , now you give her .
demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .
awaking o helena , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine !
to what , my love , shall i compare thine eyne ?
crystal is muddy .
o , how ripe in show thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow !
that pure congealed white , high taurus snow , fann with the eastern wind , turns to a crow when thou up thy hand o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss !
o spite !
o hell !
i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment if you we re civil and knew courtesy , you would not do me thus much injury .
can you not hate me , as i know you do , but you must join in souls to mock me too ?
if you were men , as men you are in show , you would not use a gentle lady so , to vow , and swear , and superpraise my parts , when i am sure you hate me with your hearts .
you both are rivals , and love hermia , and now both rivals , to mock helena a trim exploit , a manly enterprise , to conjure tears up in a poor maid eyes with your derision !
none of noble sort would so offend a virgin , and extort a poor soul patience , all to make you sport .
you are unkind , demetrius , be not so , for you love hermia , this you know i know and here , with all good will , with all my heart , in hermia love i yield you up my part , and yours of helena to me bequeath , whom i do love and will do till my death .
never did mockers waste more idle breath .
lysander , keep thy hermia , i will none if i loved her , all that love is gone .
my heart to her but as sojourn , and now to helen is it home return , there to remain .
helen , it is not so .
disparage not the faith thou dost not know , lest , to thy peril , thou aby it dear .
look , where thy love comes , yonder is thy dear .
hermia dark night , that from the eye his function takes , the ear more quick of apprehension makes , wherein it doth impair the seeing sense , it pays the hearing double recompense .
thou art not by mine eye , lysander , found , mine ear , i thank it , brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
why should he stay , whom love doth press to go ?
what love could press lysander from my side ?
lysander love , that would not let him bide , fair helena , who more engilds the night than all you fiery oes and eyes of light .
why thou me ?
could not this make thee know , the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so ?
you speak not as you think it can not be .
lo , she is one of this confederacy !
now i perceive they have conjoin all three to fashion this false sport , in spite of me .
injurious hermia !
most ungrateful maid !
have you conspired , have you with these contrived to bait me with this foul derision ?
is all the counsel that we two have shared , the sisters ' vows , the hours that we have spent , when we have chid the time for parting us , o , is it all forgot ?
all ' friendship , childhood innocence ?
we , hermia , like two artificial gods , have with our needles created both one flower , both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , both warbling of one song , both in one key , as if our hands , our sides , voices and minds , had been incorporate .
so we grow together , like to a double cherry , seeming parted , but yet an union in partition , two lovely berries moulded on one stem , so , with two seeming bodies , but one heart , two of the first , like coats in heraldry , due but to one and crowned with one crest .
and will you rent our ancient love asunder , to join with men in scorning your poor friend ?
it is not friendly , is not maidenly our sex , as well as i , may chide you for it , though i alone do feel the injury .
i am amazed at your passionate words .
i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me .
have you not set lysander , as in scorn , to follow me and praise my eyes and face ?
and made your other love , demetrius , who even but now did spurn me with his foot , to call me goddess , nymph , divine and rare , precious , celestial ?
wherefore speaks he this to her he hates ?
and wherefore doth lysander deny your love , so rich within his soul , and tender me , forsooth , affection , but by your setting on , by your consent ?
what thought i be not so in grace as you , so hung upon with love , so fortunate , but miserable most , to love unloved ?
this you should pity rather than despise .
i understand not what you mean by this .
ay , do , persever , counterfeit sad looks , make mouths upon me when i turn my back , wink each at other , hold the sweet jest up this sport , well carried , shall be chronicled .
if you have any pity , grace , or manners , you would not make me such an argument .
but fare ye well is partly my own fault , which death or absence soon shall remedy .
stay , gentle helena , hear my excuse my love , my life my soul , fair helena !
o excellent !
sweet , do not scorn her so .
if she can not entreat , i can compel .
thou canst compel no more than she entreat thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers .
helen , i love thee , by my life , i do i swear by that which i will lose for thee , to prove him false that says i love thee not .
i say i love thee more than he can do .
if thou say so , withdraw , and prove it too .
quick , come !
lysander , whereto tends all this ?
away , you ethiope !
no , no , he seem to break loose , take on as you would follow , but yet come not you are a tame man , go !
hang off , thou cat , thou burr !
vile thing , let loose , or i will shake thee from me like a serpent !
why are you grown so rude ?
what change is this ?
sweet love , thy love !
out , tawny tartar , out !
out , loathed medicine !
hated potion , hence !
do you not jest ?
yes , sooth , and so do you .
demetrius , i will keep my word with thee .
i would i had your bond , for i perceive a weak bond holds you i not trust your word .
what , should i hurt her , strike her , kill her dead ?
although i hate her , i not harm her so .
what , can you do me greater harm than hate ?
hate me !
wherefore ?
o me !
what news , my love !
am not i hermia ?
are not you lysander ?
i am as fair now as i was erewhile .
since night you loved me , yet since night you left me why , then you left me o , the gods forbid ! in earnest , shall i say ?
ay , by my life , and never did desire to see thee more .
therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt , be certain , nothing truer , is no jest that i do hate thee and love helena .
o me !
you juggler !
you !
you thief of love !
what , have you come by night and stolen my love heart from him ?
fine , !
have you no modesty , no maiden shame , no touch of bashfulness ?
what , will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue ?
fie , fie !
you counterfeit , you puppet , you !
puppet ?
why so ?
ay , that way goes the game .
now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures , she hath urged her height , and with her personage , her tall personage , her height , forsooth , she hath prevail with him .
and are you grown so high in his esteem , because i am so dwarfish and so low ?
how low am i , thou painted maypole ?
speak , how low am i ?
i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes .
i pray you , though you mock me , gentlemen , let her not hurt me i was never curst , i have no gift at all in shrewishness , i am a right maid for my cowardice let her not strike me .
you perhaps may think , because she is something lower than myself , that i can match her .
lower !
hark , again .
good hermia , do not be so bitter with me .
i evermore did love you , hermia , did ever keep your counsels , never wrong you , save that , in love unto demetrius , i told him of your stealth unto this wood .
he follow you , for love i follow him , but he hath chid me hence and threaten me to strike me , spurn me , nay , to kill me too and now , so you will let me quiet go , to athens will i bear my folly back and follow you no further let me go you see how simple and how fond i am .
why , get you gone who that hinders you ?
a foolish heart , that i leave here behind .
what , with lysander ?
with demetrius .
be not afraid , she shall not harm thee , helena .
no , sir , she shall not , though you take her part .
o , when she angry , she is keen and shrewd !
she was a vixen when she went to school , and though she be but little , she is fierce .
' again !
nothing but ' and ' !
why will you suffer her to flout me thus ?
let me come to her .
get you gone , you dwarf , you minimus , of hindering made , you bead , you acorn .
you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services .
let her alone speak not of helena , take not her part , for , if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her , thou shalt aby it .
now she holds me not , now follow , if thou darest , to try whose right , of thine or mine , is most in helena .
follow !
nay , i go with thee , cheek by jole .
exeunt lysander and demetrius you , mistress , all this coil is of you nay , go not back .
i will not trust you , i , nor longer stay in your curst company .
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray , my legs are longer though , to run away .
exit i am amazed , and know not what to say .
exit this is thy negligence still thou mistakest , or else thy knaveries wilfully .
believe me , king of shadows , i mistook .
did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garment be had on ?
and so far blameless proves my enterprise , that i have an athenian eyes , and so far am i glad it so did sort as this their jangling i esteem a sport .
thou these lovers seek a place to fight hie therefore , robin , overcast the night , the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as acheron , and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within another way .
like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue , then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong , and sometime rail thou like demetrius , and from each other look thou lead them thus , till their brows sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep then crush this herb into lysander eye , whose liquor hath this virtuous property , to take from thence all error with his might , and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight .
when they next wake , all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision , and back to athens shall the lovers wend , with league whose date till death shall never end .
whiles i in this affair do thee employ , i to my queen and beg her indian boy , and then i will her charmed eye release from monster view , and all things shall be peace .
my fairy lord , this must be done with haste , for night swift dragons cut the clouds full fast , and yonder shines aurora harbinger , at whose approach , ghosts , wandering here and there , troop home to churchyards damned spirits all , that in crossways and floods have burial , already to their wormy beds are gone , for fear lest day should look their shames upon , they willfully themselves exile from light and must for aye consort with night .
but we are spirits of another sort i with the morning love have oft made sport , and , like a forester , the groves may tread , even till the eastern gate , all , opening on neptune with fair blessed beams , turns into yellow gold his salt green streams .
but , notwithstanding , haste , make no delay we may effect this business yet ere day .
exit up and down , up and down , i will lead them up and down i am fear in field and town goblin , lead them up and down .
here comes one .
lysander where art thou , proud demetrius ?
speak thou now .
here , villain , drawn and ready .
where art thou ?
i will be with thee straight .
follow me , then , to plainer ground .
exit lysander , as following the voice demetrius lysander !
speak again thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ?
speak !
in some bush ?
where dost thou hide thy head ?
thou coward , art thou bragging to the stars , telling the bushes that thou for wars , and wilt not come ?
come , recreant , come , thou child , i whip thee with a rod he is defiled that draws a sword on thee .
yea , art thou there ?
follow my voice we try no manhood here .
exeunt lysander he goes before me and still dares me on when i come where he calls , then he is gone .
the villain is much than i i follow fast , but faster he did fly , that fallen am i in dark uneven way , and here will rest me .
lies down come , thou gentle day !
for if but once thou show me thy grey light , i find demetrius and revenge this spite .
sleeps puck and demetrius ho , ho , ho !
coward , why comest thou not ?
abide me , if thou darest , for well i wot thou before me , shifting every place , and darest not stand , nor look me in the face .
where art thou now ?
come hither i am here .
nay , then , thou me .
thou shalt buy this dear , if ever i thy face by daylight see now , go thy way .
faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed .
by day approach look to be visited .
lies down and sleeps helena o weary night , o long and tedious night , abate thy hour !
shine comforts from the east , that i may back to athens by daylight , from these that my poor company detest and sleep , that sometimes shuts up sorrow eye , steal me awhile from mine own company .
lies down and sleeps yet but three ?
come one more , two of both kinds make up four .
here she comes , curst and sad cupid is a knavish lad , thus to make poor females mad .
hermia never so weary , never so in woe , bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers , i can no further crawl , no further go , my legs can keep no pace with my desires .
here will i rest me till the break of day .
heavens shield lysander , if they mean a fray !
lies down and sleeps on the ground sleep sound i apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy .
squeezing the juice on lysander eyes when thou wakest , thou takest true delight in the sight of thy former lady eye and the country proverb known , that every man should take his own , in your waking shall be shown jack shall have jill , nought shall go ill , the man shall have his mare again , and all shall be well .

mounsieur cobweb , good mounsieur , get you your weapons in your hand , and kill me a on the top of a thistle , and , good mounsieur , bring me the .

pray you , leave your courtesy , good mounsieur .
what your will ?
nothing , good mounsieur , but to help cavalery cobweb to scratch .
i must to the barber , monsieur , for methinks i am marvellous hairy about the face , and i am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , i must scratch .
what , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ?
i have a reasonable good ear in music .
let have the tongs and the bones .
or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
truly , a peck of provender i could munch your good dry oats .
methinks i have a great desire to a bottle of hay good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel hoard , and fetch thee new nuts .
i had rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
but , i pray you , let none of your people stir me i have an exposition of sleep come upon me .
sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms .
fairies , begone , and be all ways away .
exeunt fairies so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist , the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm .
o , how i love thee !
how i dote on thee !
they sleep enter puck advancing welcome , good robin .
thou this sweet sight ?
her dotage now i do begin to pity for , meeting her of late behind the wood , seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool , i did upbraid her and fall out with her , for she his hairy temples then had rounded with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers , and that same dew , which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls , stood now within the pretty flowerets ' eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail .
when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms begg my patience , i then did ask of her her changeling child , which straight she gave me , and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land .
and now i have the boy , i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes and , gentle puck , take this transformed scalp from off the head of this athenian swain , that , he awaking when the other do , may all to athens back again repair and think no more of this night accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream .
but first i will release the fairy queen .
be as thou wast wont to be , see as thou wast wont to see dian bud cupid flower hath such force and blessed power .
now , my titania , wake you , my sweet queen .
my oberon !
what visions have i seen !
methought i was enamour of an ass .
there lies your love .
how came these things to pass ?
o , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now !
silence awhile .
robin , take off this head .
titania , music call , and strike more dead than common sleep of all these five the sense .
music , ho !
music , such as charmeth sleep !
music , still now , when thou wakest , with thine own fool eyes peep .
sound , music !
come , my queen , take hands with me , and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be .
now thou and i are new in amity , and will midnight solemnly dance in duke theseus ' house triumphantly , and bless it to all fair prosperity there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded , with theseus , all in jollity .
fairy king , attend , and mark i do hear the morning lark .
then , my queen , in silence sad , trip we after the night shade we the globe can compass soon , swifter than the wandering moon .
come , my lord , and in our flight tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground .
exeunt horns winded within enter theseus , hippolyta , egeus , and train go , one of you , find out the forester , for now our observation is perform , and since we have the vaward of the day , my love shall hear the music of my hounds .
uncouple in the western valley , let them go dispatch , i say , and find the forester .
exit an attendant we will , fair queen , up to the mountain top , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction .
i was with hercules and cadmus once , when in a wood of crete they bay the bear with hounds of sparta never did i hear such gallant chiding for , besides the groves , the skies , the fountains , every region near seem all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew , so sanded , and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew , , and like thessalian bulls , slow in pursuit , but match in mouth like bells , each under each .
a cry more tuneable was never holla to , nor cheer with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly judge when you hear .
but , soft !
what nymphs are these ?
my lord , this is my daughter here asleep , and this , lysander , this demetrius is , this helena , old nedar helena i wonder of their being here together .
no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may , and hearing our intent , came here in grace our solemnity .
but speak , egeus , is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice ?
it is , my lord .
go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns .
horns and shout within .
lysander , demetrius , helena , and hermia wake and start up good morrow , friends .
saint valentine is past begin these but to couple now ?
pardon , my lord .
i pray you all , stand up .
i know you two are rival enemies how comes this gentle concord in the world , that hatred is so far from jealousy , to sleep by hate , and fear no enmity ?
my lord , i shall reply amazedly , half sleep , half waking but as yet , i swear , i can not truly say how i came here , but , as i think , for truly would i speak , and now do i bethink me , so it is , i came with hermia hither our intent was to be gone from athens , where we might , without the peril of the athenian law .
enough , enough , my lord , you have enough i beg the law , the law , upon his head .
they would have stolen away , they would , demetrius , thereby to have defeated you and me , you of your wife and me of my consent , of my consent that she should be your wife .
my lord , fair helen told me of their stealth , of this their purpose hither to this wood , and i in fury hither follow them , fair helena in fancy following me .
but , my good lord , i wot not by what power , but by some power it is , my love to hermia , melted as the snow , seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon , and all the faith , the virtue of my heart , the object and the pleasure of mine eye , is only helena .
to her , my lord , was i betroth ere i saw hermia but , like in sickness , did i loathe this food , but , as in health , come to my natural taste , now i do wish it , love it , long for it , and will for evermore be true to it .
fair lovers , you are fortunately met of this discourse we more will hear anon .
egeus , i will overbear your will , for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit and , for the morning now is something worn , our purposed hunting shall be set aside .
away with us to athens , three and three , we hold a feast in great solemnity .
come , hippolyta .
exeunt theseus , hippolyta , egeus , and train these things seem small and undistinguishable , methinks i see these things with parted eye , when every thing seems double .
so methinks and i have found demetrius like a jewel , mine own , and not mine own .
are you sure that we are awake ?
it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream .
do not you think the duke was here , and bid us follow him ?
yea , and my father .
and hippolyta .
and he did bid us follow to the temple .
why , then , we are awake let follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams .
exeunt awaking when my cue comes , call me , and i will answer my next is , fair pyramus . '
!
peter quince !
flute , the !
snout , the tinker !
starveling !
god my life , stolen hence , and left me asleep !
i have had a most rare vision .
i have had a dream , past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass , if he go about to expound this dream .
methought i was there is no man can tell what .
methought i was , and methought i had , but man is but a patched fool , if he will offer to say what methought i had .
the eye of man hath not heard , the ear of man hath not seen , man hand is not able to taste , his tongue to conceive , nor his heart to report , what my dream was .
i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called bottom dream , because it hath no bottom , and i will sing it in the latter end of a play , before the duke peradventure , to make it the more gracious , i shall sing it at her death .
exit scene ii .
athens .
quince house .
enter quince , flute , snout , and starveling have you sent to bottom house ?
is he come home yet ?
he can not be heard of .
out of doubt he is transported .
if he come not , then the play is marred it goes not forward , doth it ?
it is not possible you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he .
no , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens .
yea and the best person too , and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice .
you must say ' a paramour is , god bless us , a thing of naught .
enter snug masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
o sweet bully bottom !
thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life , he could not have sixpence a day an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus , i be hanged , he would have deserved it sixpence a day in pyramus , or nothing .
enter bottom where are these lads ?
where are these hearts ?
bottom !
o most courageous day !
o most happy hour !
masters , i am to discourse wonders but ask me not what , for if i tell you , i am no true athenian .
i will tell you every thing , right as it fell out .
let us hear , sweet bottom .
not a word of me .
all that i will tell you is , that the duke hath dined .
get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps , meet presently at the palace , every man look his part , for the short and the long is , our play is preferred .
in any case , let thisby have clean linen , and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails , for they shall hang out for the lion claws .
and , most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlic , for we are to utter sweet breath , and i do not doubt but to hear them say , it is a sweet comedy .
no more words away !
go , away !
exeunt act v scene athens .
the palace of theseus .
enter theseus , hippolyta , philostrate , lords and attendants is strange my theseus , that these lovers speak of .
more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys .
lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends .
the lunatic , the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold , that is , the madman the lover , all as frantic , sees helen beauty in a brow of egypt the poet eye , in fine frenzy rolling , doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven , and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown , the poet pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name .
such tricks hath strong imagination , that if it would but apprehend some joy , it comprehends some bringer of that joy , or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear !
but all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigured so together , more witnesseth than fancy images and grows to something of great constancy , but , howsoever , strange and admirable .
here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth .
enter lysander , demetrius , hermia , and helena joy , gentle friends !
joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts !
more than to us wait in your royal walks , your board , your bed !
come now , what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours between our and ?
where is our usual manager of mirth ?
what revels are in hand ?
is there no play , to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ?
call philostrate .
here , mighty theseus .
say , what abridgement have you for this evening ?
what masque ?
what music ?
how shall we beguile the lazy time , if not with some delight ?
there is a brief how many sports are ripe make choice of which your highness will see first .
giving a paper reads battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . '
we none of that that have i told my love , in glory of my kinsman hercules .
reads riot of the tipsy bacchanals , tearing the thracian singer in their rage . '
that is an old device , and it was play when i from thebes came last a conqueror .
reads thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning , late deceased in beggary . '
that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony .
reads ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe , very tragical mirth . '
merry and tragical !
tedious and brief !
that is , hot ice and wondrous strange snow .
how shall we find the concord of this discord ?
a play there is , my lord , some ten words long , which is as brief as i have known a play , but by ten words , my lord , it is too long , which makes it tedious , for in all the play there is not one word apt , one player fitted and tragical , my noble lord , it is , for pyramus therein doth kill himself .
which , when i saw rehearsed , i must confess , made mine eyes water , but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed .
what are they that do play it ?
men that work in athens here , which never labour in their minds till now , and now have toil their unbreathed memories with this same play , against your nuptial .
and we will hear it .
no , my noble lord , it is not for you i have heard it over , and it is nothing , nothing in the world , unless you can find sport in their intents , extremely stretch and conn with cruel pain , to do you service .
i will hear that play , for never anything can be amiss , when simpleness and duty tender it .
go , bring them in and take your places , ladies .
exit philostrate i love not to see wretchedness charged and duty in his service perishing .
why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
he says they can do nothing in this kind .
the kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing .
our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty can not do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit .
where i have come , great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes , where i have seen them shiver and look pale , make periods in the midst of sentences , throttle their practised accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome .
trust me , sweet , out of this silence yet i pick a welcome , and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence .
love , therefore , and simplicity in least speak most , to my capacity .
philostrate so please your grace , the prologue is address .
let him approach .
flourish of trumpets enter quince for the prologue if we offend , it is with our good will .
that you should think , we come not to offend , but with good will .
to show our simple skill , that is the true beginning of our end .
consider then we come but in despite .
we do not come as minding to contest you , our true intent is .
all for your delight we are not here .
that you should here repent you , the actors are at hand and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know .
this fellow doth not stand upon points .
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt , he knows not the stop .
a good moral , my lord it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .
indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder , a sound , but not in government .
his speech , was like a tangled chain , nothing impaired , but all disordered .
who is next ?
enter pyramus and thisbe , wall , moonshine , and lion gentles , perchance you wonder at this show , but wonder on , till truth make all things plain .
this man is pyramus , if you would know , this beauteous lady thisby is certain .
this man , with lime and , doth present wall , that vile wall which did these lovers sunder , and through wall chink , poor souls , they are content to whisper .
at the which let no man wonder .
this man , with lanthorn , dog , and bush of thorn , presenteth moonshine , for , if you will know , by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus ' tomb , there , there to woo .
this grisly beast , which lion hight by name , the trusty thisby , coming first by night , did scare away , or rather did affright , and , as she fled , her mantle she did fall , which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain .
anon comes pyramus , sweet youth and tall , and finds his trusty thisby mantle slain whereat , with blade , with bloody blameful blade , he bravely broach is boiling bloody breast , and thisby , tarrying in mulberry shade , his dagger drew , and died .
for all the rest , let lion , moonshine , wall , and lovers twain at large discourse , while here they do remain .
exeunt prologue , thisbe , lion , and moonshine i wonder if the lion be to speak .
no wonder , my lord one lion may , when many asses do .
in this same interlude it doth befall that i , one snout by name , present a wall , and such a wall , as i would have you think , that had in it a crannied hole or chink , through which the lovers , pyramus and thisby , did whisper often very secretly .
this loam , this and this stone doth show that i am that same wall , the truth is so and this the cranny is , right and sinister , through which the fearful lovers are to whisper .
would you desire lime and hair to speak better ?
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse , my lord .
enter pyramus pyramus draws near the wall silence !
o night !
o night with hue so black !
o night , which ever art when day is not !
o night , o night !
alack , alack , alack , i fear my thisby promise is forgot !
and thou , o wall , o sweet , o lovely wall , that between her father ground and mine !
thou wall , o wall , o sweet and lovely wall , show me thy chink , to blink through with mine eyne !
wall holds up his fingers thanks , courteous wall jove shield thee well for this !
but what see i ?
no thisby do i see .
o wicked wall , through whom i see no bliss !
cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
no , in truth , sir , he should not .
me ' is thisby cue she is to enter now , and i am to spy her through the wall .
you shall see , it will fall pat as i told you .
yonder she comes .
enter thisbe o wall , full often hast thou heard my moans , for parting my fair pyramus and me !
my cherry lips have often kiss thy stones , thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee .
i see a voice now will i to the chink , to spy an i can hear my thisby face .
thisby !
my love thou art , my love i think .
think what thou wilt , i am thy lover grace , and , like limander , am i trusty still .
and i like helen , till the fates me kill .
not shafalus to procrus was so true .
as shafalus to procrus , i to you .
o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall !
i kiss the wall hole , not your lips at all .
wilt thou at ninny tomb meet me straightway ?
life , death , i come without delay .
exeunt pyramus and thisbe thus have i , wall , my part discharged so , and , being done , thus wall away doth go .
exit now is the mural down between the two neighbours .
no remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning .
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard .
the best in this kind are but shadows , and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them .
it must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men .
here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .
enter lion and moonshine you , ladies , you , whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor , may now perchance both quake and tremble here , when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar .
then know that i , one snug the joiner , am a , nor else no lion dam , for , if i should as lion come in strife into this place , pity on my life .
a very gentle beast , of a good conscience .
the very best at a beast , my lord , that i saw .
this lion is a very fox for his valour .
true , and a goose for his discretion .
not so , my lord , for his valour can not carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .
his discretion , i am sure , can not carry his valour , for the goose carries not the fox .
it is well leave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .
this lanthorn doth the horned moon present , he should have worn the horns on his head .
he is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference .
this lanthorn doth the horned moon present , myself the man i ' the moon do seem to be .
this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn .
how is it else the man i ' the moon ?
he dares not come there for the candle , for , you see , it is already in snuff .
i am aweary of this moon would he would change !
it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane , but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must stay the time .
proceed , moon .
all that i have to say , is , to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon , i , the man in the moon , this , my , and this dog , my dog .
why , all these should be in the lanthorn , for all these are in the moon .
but , silence !
here comes thisbe .
enter thisbe this is old ninny tomb .
where is my love ?
roaring oh thisbe runs off well roared , lion .
well run , thisbe .
well shone , moon .
truly , the moon shines with a good grace .
the lion shakes thisbe mantle , and exit well moused , lion .
and so the lion vanished .
and then came pyramus .
enter pyramus sweet moon , i thank thee for thy sunny beams , i thank thee , moon , for shining now so bright , for , by thy gracious , golden , glittering gleams , i trust to take of truest thisby sight .
but stay , o spite !
but mark , poor knight , what dreadful dole is here !
eyes , do you see ?
how can it be ?
o dainty duck !
o dear !
thy mantle good , what , stain with blood !
approach , ye furies fell !
o fates , come , come , cut thread and thrum , quail , crush , conclude , and quell !
this passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad .
beshrew my heart , but i pity the man .
o wherefore , nature , didst thou lions frame ?
since lion vile hath here deflower my dear which is no , no which was the fairest dame that lived , that loved , that liked , that look with cheer .
come , tears , confound , out , sword , and wound the pap of pyramus , ay , that left pap , where heart doth hop stabs himself thus die i , thus , thus , thus .
now am i dead , now am i fled , my soul is in the sky tongue , lose thy light , moon take thy flight exit moonshine now die , die , die , die , die .
dies no die , but an ace , for him , for he is but one .
less than an ace , man , for he is dead , he is nothing .
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover , and prove an ass .
how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ?
she will find him by starlight .
here she comes , and her passion ends the play .
thisbe methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be brief .
a mote will turn the balance , which pyramus , which thisbe , is the better , he for a man , god warrant us , she for a woman , god bless us .
she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
and thus she means , videlicet asleep , my love ?
what , dead , my dove ?
o pyramus , arise !
speak , speak .
quite dumb ?
dead , dead ?
a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes .
these my lips , this cherry nose , these yellow cowslip cheeks , are gone , are gone lovers , make moan his eyes were green as leeks .
o sisters three , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk , lay them in gore , since you have shore with shears his thread of silk .
tongue , not a word come , trusty sword , come , blade , my breast imbrue stabs herself and , farewell , friends , thus thisby ends adieu , adieu , adieu .
dies moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead .
ay , and wall too .
starting up no assure you , the wall is down that parted their fathers .
will it please you to see the epilogue , or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company ?
no epilogue , i pray you , for your play needs no excuse .
never excuse , for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed .
marry , if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbe garter , it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is , truly , and very notably discharged .
but come , your bergomask let your epilogue alone .
a dance the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers , to bed , is almost fairy time .
i fear we shall the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatch .
this play hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night .
sweet friends , to bed .
a fortnight hold we this solemnity , in nightly revels and new jollity .
exeunt enter puck now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon , whilst the heavy ploughman snores , all with weary task fordone .
now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the , screeching loud , puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud .
now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide , every one lets forth his sprite , in the paths to glide and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate team , from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , now are frolic not a mouse shall disturb this hallow house i am sent with broom before , to sweep the dust behind the door .
enter oberon and titania with their train through the house give gathering light , by the dead and drowsy fire every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier , and this ditty , after me , sing , and dance it trippingly .
first , rehearse your song by rote to each word a warbling note hand in hand , with fairy grace , will we sing , and bless this place .
song and dance now , until the break of day , through this house each fairy stray .
to the best will we , which by us shall blessed be , and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate .
so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be , and the blots of nature hand shall not in their issue stand , never mole , hare lip , nor scar , nor mark prodigious , such as are despised in nativity , shall upon their children be .
with this consecrate , every fairy take his gait , and each several chamber bless , through this palace , with sweet peace , and the owner of it blest ever shall in safety rest .
trip away , make no stay , meet me all by break of day .
exeunt oberon , titania , and train if we shadows have offended , think but this , and all is mended , that you have but slumber here while these visions did appear .
and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend if you pardon , we will mend and , as i am an honest puck , if we have unearned luck now to the serpent tongue , we will make amends ere long , else the puck a liar call , so , good night unto you all .
give me your hands , if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends .
act i scene i .
before leonato house .
enter leonato , hero , and beatrice , with a messenger i learn in this letter that don peter of arragon comes this night to messina .
he is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him .
how many gentlemen have you lost in this action ?
but few of any sort , and none of name .
a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers .
i find here that don peter hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio .
much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age , doing , in the figure of a lamb , the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how .
he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it .
i have already delivered him letters , and there appears much joy in him , even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness .
did he break out into tears ?
in great measure .
a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed .
how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping !
i pray you , is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no ?
i know none of that name , lady there was none such in the army of any sort .
what is he that you ask for , niece ?
my cousin means signior benedick of padua .
o , he returned , and as pleasant as ever he was .
he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight , and my uncle fool , reading the challenge , subscribed for cupid , and challenged him at the .
i pray you , how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars ?
but how many hath he killed ?
for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing .
faith , niece , you tax signior benedick too much , but he be meet with you , i doubt it not .
he hath done good service , lady , in these wars .
you had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman , he hath an excellent stomach .
and a good soldier too , lady .
and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord ?
a lord to a lord , a man to a man , stuffed with all honourable virtues .
it is so , indeed , he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing , well , we are all mortal .
you must not , sir , mistake my niece .
there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there a skirmish of wit between them .
alas !
he gets nothing by that .
in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off , and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm , let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse , for it is all the wealth that he hath left , to be known a reasonable creature .
who is his companion now ?
he hath every month a new sworn brother .
possible ?
very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat , it ever changes with the next block .
i see , lady , the gentleman is not in your books .
no , an he were , i would burn my study .
but , i pray you , who is his companion ?
is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil ?
he is most in the company of the right noble claudio .
o lord , he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence , and the taker runs presently mad .
god help the noble claudio !
if he have caught the benedick , it will cost him a thousand pound ere a ' be cured .
i will hold friends with you , lady .
do , good friend .
you will never run mad , niece .
no , not till a hot january .
don pedro is approached .
enter don pedro , don john , claudio , benedick , and balthasar good signior leonato , you are come to meet your trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid cost , and you encounter it .
never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone , comfort should remain , but when you depart from me , sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave .
you embrace your charge too willingly .
i think this is your daughter .
her mother hath many times told me so .
were you in doubt , sir , that you asked her ?
signior benedick , no , for then were you a child .
you have it full , benedick we may guess by this what you are , being a man .
truly , the lady fathers herself .
be happy , lady , for you are like an honourable father .
if signior leonato be her father , she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina , as like him as she is .
i wonder that you will still be talking , signior benedick nobody marks you .
what , my dear lady disdain !
are you yet living ?
is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick ?
courtesy itself must convert to disdain , if you come in her presence .
then is courtesy a turncoat .
but it is certain i am loved of all ladies , only you excepted and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart , for , truly , i love none .
a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor .
i thank god and my cold blood , i am of your humour for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me .
god keep your ladyship still in that mind !
so some gentleman or other shall a predestinate scratched face .
scratching could not make it worse , an such a face as yours were .
well , you are a rare .
a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours .
i would my horse had the speed of your tongue , and so good a continuer .
but keep your way , i ' god name , i have done .
you always end with a jade trick i know you of old .
that is the sum of all , leonato .
signior claudio and signior benedick , my dear friend leonato hath invited you all .
i tell him we shall stay here at the least a month , and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer .
i dare swear he is no hypocrite , but prays from his heart .
if you swear , my lord , you shall not be forsworn .
to don john let me bid you welcome , my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother , i owe you all duty .
i thank you i am not of many words , but i thank you .
please it your grace lead on ?
your hand , leonato , we will go together .
exeunt all except benedick and claudio benedick , didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato ?
i noted her not , but i looked on her .
is she not a modest young lady ?
do you question me , as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment , or would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex ?
no , i pray thee speak in sober judgment .
why , i ' faith , methinks she too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation i can afford her , that were she other than she is , she were unhandsome , and being no other but as she is , i do not like her .
thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her .
would you buy her , that you inquire after her ?
can the world buy such a jewel ?
yea , and a case to put it into .
but speak you this with a sad brow ?
or do you play the flouting jack , to tell us cupid is a good and vulcan a rare carpenter ?
come , in what key shall a man take you , to go in the song ?
in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on .
i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such matter there her cousin , an she were not possessed with a fury , exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december .
but i hope you have no intent to turn husband , have you ?
i would scarce trust myself , though i had sworn the contrary , if hero would be my wife .
come to this ?
in faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion ?
shall i never see a bachelor of again ?
go to , i ' faith , an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke , wear the print of it and sigh away sundays .
look don pedro is returned to seek you .
don pedro what secret hath held you here , that you followed not to leonato ?
i would your grace would constrain me to tell .
i charge thee on thy allegiance .
you hear , count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man , i would have you think so , but , on my allegiance , mark you this , on my allegiance .
he is in love .
with who ?
now that is your grace part .
mark how short his answer is , with hero , leonato short daughter .
if this were so , so were it uttered .
like the old tale , my lord is not so , nor was not so , but , indeed , god forbid it should be so . '
if my passion change not shortly , god forbid it should be otherwise .
amen , if you love her , for the lady is very well worthy .
you speak this to fetch me in , my lord .
by my troth , i speak my thought .
and , in faith , my lord , i spoke mine .
and , by my two faiths and troths , my lord , i spoke mine .
that i love her , i feel .
that she is worthy , i know .
that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy , is the opinion that fire can not melt out of me i will die in it at the stake .
thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty .
and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will .
that a woman conceived me , i thank her , that she brought me up , i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead , or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick , all women shall pardon me .
because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any , i will do myself the right to trust none , and the fine is , for the which i may go the finer , i will live a bachelor .
i shall see thee , ere i die , look pale with love .
with anger , with sickness , or with hunger , my lord , not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking , pick out mine eyes with a pen and hang me up at the door of a for the sign of blind cupid .
well , if ever thou dost fall from this faith , thou wilt prove a notable argument .
if i do , hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me , and he that hits me , let him be clapped on the shoulder , and called adam .
well , as time shall try time the savage bull doth bear the yoke . '
the savage bull may , but if ever the sensible benedick bear it , pluck off the bull horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted , and in such great letters as they write is good horse to hire , ' let them signify under my sign you may see benedick the married man . '
if this should ever happen , thou wouldst be .
nay , if cupid have not spent all his quiver in venice , thou wilt quake for this shortly .
i look for an earthquake too , then .
well , you temporize with the hours .
in the meantime , good signior benedick , repair to leonato commend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper , for indeed he hath made great preparation .
i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage , and so i commit you to the tuition of god from my house , if i had it , the sixth of july your loving friend , benedick .
nay , mock not , mock not .
the body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments , and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further , examine your conscience and so i leave you .
exit my liege , your highness now may do me good .
my love is thine to teach teach it but how , and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good .
hath leonato any son , my lord ?
no child but hero , she his only heir .
dost thou affect her , claudio ?
o , my lord , when you went onward on this ended action , i look upon her with a soldier eye , that liked , but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love but now i am return and that have left their places vacant , in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires , all prompting me how fair young hero is , saying , i liked her ere i went to wars .
thou wilt be like a lover presently and tire the hearer with a book of words .
if thou dost love fair hero , cherish it , and i will break with her and with her father , and thou shalt have her .
not to this end that thou to twist so fine a story ?
how sweetly you do minister to love , that know love grief by his complexion !
but lest my liking might too sudden seem , i would have salved it with a longer treatise .
what need the bridge much broader than the flood ?
the fairest grant is the necessity .
look , what will serve is fit is once , thou lovest , and i will fit thee with the remedy .
i know we shall have revelling i will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair hero i am claudio , and in her bosom i unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale then after to her father will i break , and the conclusion is , she shall be thine .
in practise let us put it presently .
exeunt scene ii .
a room in leonato house .
enter leonato and antonio , meeting how now , brother !
where is my cousin , your son ?
hath he provided this music ?
he is very busy about it .
but , brother , i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .
are they good ?
as the event stamps them but they have a good cover , they show well outward .
the prince and count claudio , walking in a alley in mine orchard , were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant , he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it .
hath the fellow any wit that told you this ?
a good sharp fellow i will send for him , and question him yourself .
no , no , we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal , that she may be the better prepared for an answer , if peradventure this be true .
go you and tell her of it .
enter attendants cousins , you know what you have to do .
o , i cry you mercy , friend , go you with me , and i will use your skill .
good cousin , have a care this busy time .
exeunt scene iii .
the same .
enter don john and conrade what the , my lord !
why are you thus out of measure sad ?
there is no measure in the occasion that breeds , therefore the sadness is without limit .
you should hear reason .
and when i have heard it , what blessing brings it ?
if not a present remedy , at least a patient sufferance .
i wonder that thou , being , as thou sayest thou art , born under saturn , goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief .
i can not hide what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile at no man jests , eat when i have stomach and wait for no man leisure , sleep when i am drowsy and tend on no man business , laugh when i am merry and claw no man in his humour .
yea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment .
you have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest .
i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace , and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this , though i can not be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but i am a villain .
i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog , therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage .
if i had my mouth , i would bite , if i had my liberty , i would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek not to alter me .
can you make no use of your discontent ?
i make all use of it , for i use it only .
who comes here ?
enter borachio what news , borachio ?
i came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by leonato and i can give you intelligence of an intended marriage .
will it serve for any model to build mischief on ?
what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness ?
marry , it is your brother right hand .
who ?
the most exquisite claudio ?
even he .
a proper squire !
and who , and who ?
which way looks he ?
marry , on hero , the daughter and heir of leonato .
a very forward !
how came you to this ?
being entertained for a perfumer , as i was smoking a musty room , comes me the prince and claudio , hand in hand in sad conference i whipt me behind the arras , and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo hero for himself , and having obtained her , give her to count claudio .
come , come , let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure .
that young hath all the glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way , i bless myself every way .
you are both sure , and will assist me ?
to the death , my lord .
let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that i am subdued .
would the cook were of my mind !
shall we go prove what to be done ?
we wait upon your lordship .
exeunt act ii scene i .
a hall in leonato house .
enter leonato , antonio , hero , beatrice , and others was not count john here at supper ?
i saw him not .
how tartly that gentleman looks !
i never can see him but i am an hour after .
he is of a very melancholy disposition .
he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing , and the other too like my lady eldest son , evermore tattling .
then half signior benedick tongue in count john mouth , and half count john melancholy in signior benedick face , with a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if a ' could get her .
by my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband , if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue .
in faith , she too curst .
too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god sending that way , for it is said , sends a curst cow short horns , ' but to a cow too curst he sends none .
so , by being too curst , god will send you no horns .
just , if he send me no husband , for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening .
lord , i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen .
you may light on a husband that hath no beard .
what should i do with him ?
dress him in my apparel and make him my ?
he that hath a beard is more than a youth , and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me , and he that is less than a man , i am not for him therefore , i will even take sixpence in earnest of the , and lead his apes into hell .
well , then , go you into hell ?
no , but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me , like an old cuckold , with horns on his head , and say you to heaven , beatrice , get you to heaven , here no place for you maids ' so deliver i up my apes , and away to saint peter for the heavens , he shows me where the bachelors sit , and there live we as merry as the day is long .
to hero well , niece , i trust you will be ruled by your father .
yes , faith , it is my cousin duty to make curtsy and say , as it please you . '
but yet for all that , cousin , let him be a handsome fellow , or else make another curtsy and say , as it please me . '
well , niece , i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband .
not till god make men of some other metal than earth .
would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust ?
to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ?
no , uncle , i none adam sons are my brethren , and , truly , i hold it a sin to match in my kindred .
daughter , remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind , you know your answer .
the fault will be in the music , cousin , if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important , tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer .
for , hear me , hero wooing , wedding , and repenting , is as a scotch jig , a measure , and a cinque pace the first suit is hot and hasty , like a scotch jig , and full as fantastical , the wedding , , as a measure , full of state and ancientry , and then comes repentance and , with his bad legs , falls into the cinque pace faster and faster , till he sink into his grave .
cousin , you apprehend passing shrewdly .
i have a good eye , uncle , i can see a church by daylight .
the revellers are entering , brother make good room .
all put on their masks enter don pedro , claudio , benedick , balthasar , don john , borachio , margaret , ursula and others , masked lady , will you walk about with your friend ?
so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing , i am yours for the walk , and especially when i walk away .
with me in your company ?
i may say so , when i please .
and when please you to say so ?
when i like your favour , for god defend the lute should be like the case !
my visor is philemon roof , within the house is jove .
why , then , your visor should be thatched .
speak low , if you speak love .
drawing her aside well , i would you did like me .
so would not i , for your own sake , for i have many .
which is one ?
i say my prayers aloud .
i love you the better the hearers may cry , amen .
god match me with a good dancer !
amen .
and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is done !
answer , clerk .
no more words the clerk is answered .
i know you well enough , you are signior antonio .
at a word , i am not .
i know you by the waggling of your head .
to tell you true , i counterfeit him .
you could never do him so , unless you were the very man .
here his dry hand up and down you are he , you are he .
at a word , i am not .
come , come , do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit ?
can virtue hide itself ?
go to , mum , you are he graces will appear , and there an end .
will you not tell me who told you so ?
no , you shall pardon me .
nor will you not tell me who you are ?
not now .
that i was disdainful , and that i had my good wit out of the merry tales ' well this was signior benedick that said so .
what he ?
i am sure you know him well enough .
not i , believe me .
did he never make you laugh ?
i pray you , what is he ?
why , he is the prince jester a very dull fool , only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him , and the commendation is not in his wit , but in his villany , for he both pleases men and angers them , and then they laugh at him and beat him .
i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me .
when i know the gentleman , i tell him what you say .
do , do he but break a comparison or two on me , which , peradventure not marked or not laughed at , strikes him into melancholy , and then there a partridge wing saved , for the fool will eat no supper that night .
music we must follow the leaders .
in every good thing .
nay , if they lead to any ill , i will leave them at the next turning .
dance .
then exeunt all except don john , borachio , and claudio sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it .
the ladies follow her and but one visor remains .
and that is claudio i know him by his bearing .
are not you signior benedick ?
you know me well , i am he .
signior , you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on hero , i pray you , dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it .
how know you he loves her ?
i heard him swear his affection .
so did i too , and he swore he would marry her .
come , let us to the banquet .
exeunt don john and borachio thus answer i in the name of benedick , but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio .
is certain so , the prince wooes for himself .
friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore , all hearts in love use their own tongues , let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent , for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood .
this is an accident of hourly proof , which i mistrusted not .
farewell , therefore , hero !
benedick count claudio ?
yea , the same .
come , will you go with me ?
whither ?
even to the next willow , about your own business , county .
what fashion will you wear the garland of ?
about your neck , like an usurer chain ?
or under your arm , like a lieutenant scarf ?
you must wear it one way , for the prince hath got your hero .
i wish him joy of her .
why , that spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks .
but did you think the prince would have served you thus ?
i pray you , leave me .
ho !
now you strike like the blind man was the boy that stole your meat , and you beat the post .
if it will not be , i leave you .
exit alas , poor hurt fowl !
now will he creep into sedges .
but that my lady beatrice should know me , and not know me !
the prince fool !
ha ?
it may be i go under that title because i am merry .
yea , but so i am apt to do myself wrong , i am not so reputed it is the base , though bitter , disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out .
well , i be revenged as i may .
don pedro now , signior , where the count ?
did you see him ?
troth , my lord , i have played the part of lady fame .
i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him , and i think i told him true , that your grace had got the good will of this young lady , and i offered him my company to a , either to make him a garland , as being forsaken , or to bind him up a rod , as being worthy to be whipped .
to be whipped !
what his fault ?
the flat transgression of a schoolboy , who , being overjoyed with finding a birds ' nest , shows it his companion , and he steals it .
wilt thou make a trust a transgression ?
the transgression is in the stealer .
yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made , and the garland too , for the garland he might have worn himself , and the rod he might have bestowed on you , who , as i take it , have stolen his birds ' nest .
i will but teach them to sing , and restore them to the owner .
if their singing answer your saying , by my faith , you say honestly .
the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you .
o , she misused me past the endurance of a block !
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her , my very visor began to assume life and scold with her .
she told me , not thinking i had been myself , that i was the prince jester , that i was duller than a great thaw , huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark , with a whole army shooting at me .
she speaks poniards , and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations , there were no living near her , she would infect to the north star .
i would not marry her , though she were endowed with all that adam bad left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit , yea , and have cleft his club to make the fire too .
come , talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel .
i would to god some scholar would conjure her , for certainly , while she is here , a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary , and people sin upon purpose , because they would go thither , so , indeed , all disquiet , horror and perturbation follows her .
look , here she comes .
enter claudio , beatrice , hero , and leonato will your grace command me any service to the world end ?
i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on , i will fetch you a now from the furthest inch of asia , bring you the length of prester john foot , fetch you a hair off the great cham beard , do you any embassage to the pigmies , rather than hold three words ' conference with this harpy .
you have no employment for me ?
none , but to desire your good company .
o god , sir , here a dish i love not i can not endure my lady tongue .
exit come , lady , come , you have lost the heart of signior benedick .
indeed , my lord , he lent it me awhile , and i gave him use for it , a double heart for his single one marry , once before he won it of me with false dice , therefore your grace may well say i have lost it .
you have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
so i would not he should do me , my lord , lest i should prove the mother of fools .
i have brought count claudio , whom you sent me to seek .
why , how now , count !
wherefore are you sad ?
not sad , my lord .
how then ?
sick ?
neither , my lord .
the count is neither sad , nor sick , nor merry , nor well , but civil count , civil as an orange , and something of that jealous complexion .
i ' faith , lady , i think your blazon to be true , though , i be sworn , if he be so , his conceit is false .
here , claudio , i have wooed in thy name , and fair hero is won i have broke with her father , and his good will obtained name the day of marriage , and god give thee joy !
count , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match , and an grace say amen to it .
speak , count , is your cue .
silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little happy , if i could say how much .
lady , as you are mine , i am yours i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .
speak , cousin , or , if you can not , stop his mouth with a kiss , and let not him speak neither .
in faith , lady , you have a merry heart .
yea , my lord , i thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care .
my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .
and so she doth , cousin .
good lord , for alliance !
thus goes every one to the world but i , and i am sunburnt , i may sit in a corner and cry for a husband !
lady beatrice , i will get you one .
i would rather have one of your father getting .
hath your grace a brother like you ?
your father got excellent husbands , if a maid could come by them .
will you have me , lady ?
no , my lord , unless i might have another for your grace is too costly to wear every day .
but , i beseech your grace , pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter .
your silence most offends me , and to be merry best becomes you , for , out of question , you were born in a merry hour .
no , sure , my lord , my mother cried , but then there was a star danced , and under that was i born .
cousins , god give you joy !
niece , will you look to those things i told you of ?
i cry you mercy , uncle .
by your grace pardon .
exit by my troth , a lady .
there little of the melancholy element in her , my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps , and not ever sad then , for i have heard my daughter say , she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing .
she can not endure to hear tell of a husband .
o , by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit .
she were an excellent wife for benedict .
o lord , my lord , if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad .
county claudio , when mean you to go to church ?
, my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites .
not till monday , my dear son , which is hence a just , and a time too brief , too , to have all things answer my mind .
come , you shake the head at so long a breathing but , i warrant thee , claudio , the time shall not go dully by us .
i will in the interim undertake one of hercules ' labours , which is , to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other .
i would fain have it a match , and i doubt not but to fashion it , if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction .
my lord , i am for you , though it cost me ten nights ' watchings .
and i , my lord .
and you too , gentle hero ?
i will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband .
and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know .
thus far can i praise him , he is of a noble strain , of approved valour and confirmed honesty .
i will teach you how to humour your cousin , that she shall fall in love with benedick , and i , with your two helps , will so practise on benedick that , in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach , he shall fall in love with beatrice .
if we can do this , cupid is no longer an archer hi s glory shall be ours , for we are the only .
go in with me , and i will tell you my drift .
exeunt scene ii .
the same .
enter don john and borachio it is so , the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato .
yea , my lord , but i can cross it .
any bar , any cross , any impediment will be medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him , and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine .
how canst thou cross this marriage ?
not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .
show me briefly how .
i think i told your lordship a year since , how much i am in the favour of margaret , the waiting gentlewoman to hero .
i remember .
i can , at any unseasonable instant of the night , appoint her to look out at her lady chamber window .
what life is in that , to be the death of this marriage ?
the poison of that lies in you to temper .
go you to the prince your brother , spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale , such a one as hero .
what proof shall i make of that ?
proof enough to misuse the prince , to vex claudio , to undo hero and kill leonato .
look you for any other issue ?
only to despite them , i will endeavour any thing .
go , then , find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me , intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio , as , in love of your brother honour , who hath made this match , and his friend reputation , who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid , that you have discovered thus .
they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances , which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her , hear me call margaret hero , hear margaret term me claudio , and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding , for in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent , and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown .
grow this to what adverse issue it can , i will put it in practise .
be cunning in the working this , and thy fee is a thousand ducats .
be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .
i will presently go learn their day of marriage .
exeunt scene iii .
leonato orchard .
enter benedick boy !
enter boy signior ?
in my lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard .
i am here already , sir .
i know that , but i would have thee hence , and here again .
exit boy i do much wonder that one man , seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love , will , after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others , become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man is claudio .
i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile to see a good armour , and now will he lie ten nights awake , carving the fashion of a new doublet .
he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose , like an honest man and a soldier , and now is he turned orthography , his words are a very fantastical banquet , just so many strange dishes .
may i be so converted and see with these eyes ?
i can not tell , i think not i will not be sworn , but love may transform me to an oyster , but i take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me , he shall never make me such a fool .
one woman is fair , yet i am well , another is wise , yet i am well , another virtuous , yet i am well , but till all graces be in one woman , one woman shall not come in my grace .
rich she shall be , that certain , wise , or i none , virtuous , or i never cheapen her , fair , or i never look on her , mild , or come not near me , noble , or not i for an angel , of good discourse , an excellent musician , and her hair shall be of what colour it please god .
ha !
the prince and monsieur love !
i will hide me in the arbour .
withdraws enter don pedro , claudio , and leonato come , shall we hear this music ?
yea , my good lord .
how still the evening is , as hush on purpose to grace harmony !
see you where benedick hath hid himself ?
o , very well , my lord the music ended , we fit the with a pennyworth .
enter balthasar with music come , balthasar , we hear that song again .
o , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once .
it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection .
i pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more .
because you talk of wooing , i will sing , since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinks not worthy , yet he wooes , yet will he swear he loves .
now , pray thee , come , or , if thou wilt hold longer argument , do it in notes .
note this before my notes , there not a note of mine that worth the noting .
why , these are very crotchets that he speaks , note , notes , forsooth , and nothing .
air now , divine air !
now is his soul ravished !
is it not strange that sheeps ' guts should hale souls out of men bodies ?
well , a horn for my money , when all done .
the song sigh no more , ladies , sigh no more , men were deceivers ever , one foot in sea and one on shore , to one thing constant never then sigh not so , but let them go , and be you blithe and bonny , converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny , nonny .
sing no more ditties , sing no moe , of dumps so dull and heavy , the fraud of men was ever so , since summer first was leafy then sigh not so , and by my troth , a good song .
and an ill singer , my lord .
ha , no , no , faith , thou singest well enough for a shift .
an he had been a dog that should have howled thus , they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief .
i had as lief have heard the , come what plague could have come after it .
yea , marry , dost thou hear , balthasar ?
i pray thee , get us some excellent music , for night we would have it at the lady hero .
the best i can , my lord .
do so farewell .
exit balthasar come hither , leonato .
what was it you told me of , that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick ?
o , ay stalk on .
stalk on , the fowl sits .
i did never think that lady would have loved any man .
no , nor i neither , but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick , whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor .
possible ?
sits the wind in that corner ?
by my troth , my lord , i can not tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought .
may be she doth but counterfeit .
faith , like enough .
o god , counterfeit !
there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it .
why , what effects of passion shows she ?
bait the hook well , this fish will bite .
what effects , my lord ?
she will sit you , you heard my daughter tell you how .
she did , indeed .
how , how , pray you ?
you amaze me i would have i thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection .
i would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against benedick .
i should think this a gull , but that the fellow speaks it knavery can not , sure , hide himself in such reverence .
he hath the infection hold it up .
hath she made her affection known to benedick ?
no , and swears she never will that her torment .
is true , indeed , so your daughter says i , ' says she , have so oft encountered him with scorn , write to him that i love him ? '
this says she now when she is beginning to write to him , for she be up twenty times a night , and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all .
now you talk of a sheet of paper , i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of .
o , when she had writ it and was reading it over , she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet ?
that .
o , she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence , railed at herself , that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her , ' i measure him , ' says she , my own spirit , for i should flout him , if he writ to me , yea , though i love him , i should . '
then down upon her knees she falls , weeps , sobs , beats her heart , tears her hair , prays , curses , ' o sweet benedick !
god give me patience ! '
she doth indeed , my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true .
it were good that benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
to what end ?
he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .
an he should , it were an alms to hang him .
she an excellent sweet lady , and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous .
and she is exceeding wise .
in every thing but in loving benedick .
o , my lord , wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body , we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory .
i am sorry for her , as i have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .
i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself .
i pray you , tell benedick of it , and hear what a ' will say .
were it good , think you ?
hero thinks surely she will die , for she says she will die , if he love her not , and she will die , ere she make her love known , and she will die , if he woo her , rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness .
she doth well if she should make tender of her love , is very possible he scorn it , for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit .
he is a very proper man .
he hath indeed a good outward happiness .
before god !
and , in my mind , very wise .
he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
and i take him to be valiant .
as hector , i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise , for either he avoids them with great discretion , or undertakes them with a most fear .
if he do fear god , a ' must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
and so will he do , for the man doth fear god , howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make .
well i am sorry for your niece .
shall we go seek benedick , and tell him of her love ?
never tell him , my lord let her wear it out with good counsel .
nay , that impossible she may wear her heart out first .
well , we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while .
i love benedick well , and i could wish he would modestly examine himself , to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady .
my lord , will you walk ?
dinner is ready .
if he do not dote on her upon this , i will never trust my expectation .
let there be the same net spread for her , and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry .
the sport will be , when they hold one an opinion of another dotage , and no such matter that the scene that i would see , which will be merely a .
let us send her to call him in to dinner .
exeunt don pedro , claudio , and leonato coming forward this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne .
they have the truth of this from hero .
they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent .
love me !
why , it must be requited .
i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly , if i perceive the love come from her , they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection .
i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending .
they say the lady is fair , is a truth , i can bear them witness , and virtuous , is so , i can not reprove it , and wise , but for loving me , by my troth , it is no addition to her wit , nor no great argument of her folly , for i will be horribly in love with her .
i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me , because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter ?
a man loves the meat in his youth that he can not endure in his age .
shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour ?
no , the world must be peopled .
when i said i would die a bachelor , i did not think i should live till i were married .
here comes beatrice .
by this day !
she a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her .
enter beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
fair beatrice , i thank you for your pains .
i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful , i would not have come .
you take pleasure then in the message ?
yea , just so much as you may take upon a knife point and choke a daw withal .
you have no stomach , signior fare you well .
exit ha !
my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner , ' there a double meaning in that ' i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me . '
that as much as to say , any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks .
if i do not take pity of her , i am a villain , if i do not love her , i am a jew .
i will go get her picture .
exit act iii scene leonato garden .
enter hero , margaret , and ursula good margaret , run thee to the parlor , there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her , i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her , say that thou us , and bid her steal into the pleached bower , where honeysuckles , ripen by the sun , forbid the sun to enter , like favourites , made proud by princes , that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her , to listen our purpose .
this is thy office , bear thee well in it and leave us alone .
i make her come , i warrant you , presently .
exit now , ursula , when beatrice doth come , as we do trace this alley up and down , our talk must only be of benedick .
when i do name him , let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice .
of this matter is little cupid crafty arrow made , that only wounds by hearsay .
enter beatrice , behind now begin , for look where beatrice , like a lapwing , runs close by the ground , to hear our conference .
the angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream , and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice , who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture .
fear you not my part of the dialogue .
then go we near her , that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it .
approaching the bower no , truly , ursula , she is too disdainful , i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggerds of the rock .
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely ?
so says the prince and my lord .
and did they bid you tell her of it , madam ?
they did entreat me to acquaint her of it , but i persuaded them , if they loved benedick , to wish him wrestle with affection , and never to let beatrice know of it .
why did you so ?
doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon ?
o god of love !
i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framed a woman heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice , disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes , misprising what they look on , and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she can not love , nor take no shape nor project of affection , she is so .
sure , i think so , and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love , lest she make sport at it .
why , you speak truth .
i never yet saw man , how wise , how noble , young , how rarely featured , but she would spell him backward if , she would swear the gentleman should be her sister , if black , why , nature , drawing of an antique , made a foul blot , if tall , a lance , if low , an agate very vilely cut , if speaking , why , a vane blown with all winds , if silent , why , a block moved with none .
so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth .
sure , sure , such carping is not commendable .
no , not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is , can not be commendable but who dare tell her so ?
if i should speak , she would mock me into air , o , she would laugh me out of myself , press me to death with wit .
therefore let benedick , like cover fire , consume away in sighs , waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks , which is as bad as die with tickling .
yet tell her of it hear what she will say .
no , rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion .
and , truly , i devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking .
o , do not do your cousin such a wrong .
she can not be so much without true judgment having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to have as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick .
he is the only man of italy .
always excepted my dear claudio .
i pray you , be not angry with me , madam , speaking my fancy signior benedick , for shape , for bearing , argument and valour , goes foremost in report through italy .
indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
his excellence did earn it , ere he had it .
when are you married , madam ?
why , every day , .
come , go in i show thee some attires , and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me .
she limed , i warrant you we have caught her , madam .
if it proves so , then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows , some with traps .
exeunt hero and ursula coming forward what fire is in mine ears ?
can this be true ?
stand i condemn for pride and scorn so much ?
contempt , farewell !
and maiden pride , adieu !
no glory lives behind the back of such .
and , benedick , love on , i will requite thee , taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love , my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band , for others say thou dost deserve , and i believe it better than reportingly .

a room in leonato house enter don pedro , claudio , benedick , and leonato i do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go i toward arragon .
i bring you thither , my lord , if you vouchsafe me .
nay , that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it .
i will only be bold with benedick for his company , for , from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot , he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid and the little hangman dare not shoot at him , he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks .
gallants , i am not as i have been .
so say i methinks you are sadder .
i hope he be in love .
hang him , truant !
there no true drop of blood in him , to be truly touched with love if he be sad , he wants money .
i have the toothache .
draw it .
hang it !
you must hang it first , and draw it afterwards .
what !
sigh for the toothache ?
where is but a humour or a worm .
well , every one can master a grief but he that has it .
yet say i , he is in love .
there is no appearance of fancy in him , unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises , as , to be a dutchman today , a frenchman , or in the shape of two countries at once , as , a german from the waist downward , all slops , and a spaniard from the hip upward , no doublet .
unless he have a fancy to this foolery , as it appears he hath , he is no fool for fancy , as you would have it appear he is .
if he be not in love with some woman , there is no believing old signs a ' brushes his hat o ' mornings , what should that bode ?
hath any man seen him at the barber ?
no , but the barber man hath been seen with him , and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed .
indeed , he looks younger than he did , by the loss of a beard .
nay , a ' rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that ?
that as much as to say , the sweet youth in love .
the greatest note of it is his melancholy .
and when was he wont to wash his face ?
yea , or to paint himself ?
for the which , i hear what they say of him .
nay , but his jesting spirit , which is now crept into a and now governed by stops .
indeed , that tells a heavy tale for him conclude , conclude he is in love .
nay , but i know who loves him .
that would i know too i warrant , one that knows him not .
yes , and his ill conditions , and , in despite of all , dies for him .
she shall be buried with her face upwards .
yet is this no charm for the toothache .
old signior , walk aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you , which these must not hear .
exeunt benedick and leonato for my life , to break with him about beatrice .
is even so .
hero and margaret have by this played their parts with beatrice , and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet .
enter don john my lord and brother , god save you !
good den , brother .
if your leisure served , i would speak with you .
in private ?
if it please you yet count claudio may hear , for what i would speak of concerns him .
what the matter ?
to claudio means your lordship to be married ?
you know he does .
i know not that , when he knows what i know .
if there be any impediment , i pray you discover it .
you may think i love you not let that appear hereafter , and aim better at me by that i now will manifest .
for my brother , i think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage , surely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed .
why , what the matter ?
i came hither to tell you , and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a talking of , the lady is disloyal .
who , hero ?
even she , leonato hero , your hero , every man hero disloyal ?
the word is too good to paint out her wickedness , i could say she were worse think you of a worse title , and i will fit her to it .
wonder not till further warrant go but with me , you shall see her entered , even the night before her if you love her then , wed her , but it would better fit your honour to change your mind .
may this be so ?
i will not think it .
if you dare not trust that you see , confess not that you know if you will follow me , i will show you enough , and when you have seen more and heard more , proceed accordingly .
if i see any thing why i should not marry her in the congregation , where i should wed , there will i shame her .
and , as i wooed for thee to obtain her , i will join with thee to disgrace her .
i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight , and let the issue show itself .
o day untowardly turned !
o mischief strangely thwarting !
o plague right well prevented !
so will you say when you have seen the sequel .
exeunt scene iii .
a street .
enter dogberry and verges with the watch are you good men and true ?
yea , or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation , body and soul .
nay , that were a punishment too good for them , if they should have any allegiance in them , being chosen for the prince watch .
well , give them their charge , neighbour dogberry .
first , who think you the most desertless man to be constable ?
hugh otecake , sir , or george seacole , for they can write and read .
come hither , neighbour seacole .
god hath blessed you with a good name to be a man is the gift of fortune , but to write and read comes by nature .
both which , master constable , you have i knew it would be your answer .
well , for your favour , sir , why , give god thanks , and make no boast of it , and for your writing and reading , let that appear when there is no need of such vanity .
you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch , therefore bear you the lantern .
this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men , you are to bid any man stand , in the prince name .
how if a ' will not stand ?
why , then , take no note of him , but let him go , and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave .
if he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the prince subjects .
true , and they are to meddle with none but the prince subjects .
you shall also make no noise in the streets , for , for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured .
we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch .
why , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman , for i can not see how sleeping should offend only , have a care that your bills be not stolen .
well , you are to call at all the , and bid those that are drunk get them to bed .
how if they will not ?
why , then , let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer , you may say they are not the men you took them for .
well , sir .
if you meet a thief , you may suspect him , by virtue of your office , to be no true man , and , for such kind of men , the less you meddle or make with them , why the more is for your honesty .
if we know him to be a thief , shall we not lay hands on him ?
truly , by your office , you may , but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you , if you do take a thief , is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company .
you have been always called a merciful man , partner .
truly , i would not hang a dog by my will , much more a man who hath any honesty in him .
if you hear a child cry in the night , you must call to the nurse and bid her still it .
how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us ?
why , then , depart in peace , and let the child wake her with crying , for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats .
is very true .
this is the end of the charge you , constable , are to present the prince own person if you meet the prince in the night , you may stay him .
nay , by ' r our lady , that i think a ' can not .
five shillings to one o , with any man that knows the statutes , he may stay him marry , not without the prince be willing , for , indeed , the watch ought to offend no man , and it is an offence to stay a man against his will .
by ' r lady , i think it be so .
ha , ha , ha !
well , masters , good night an there be any matter of weight chances , call up me keep your fellows ' counsels and your own , and good night .
come , neighbour .
well , masters , we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the till two , and then all to bed .
one word more , honest neighbours .
i pray you watch about signior leonato door , for the wedding being there , there is a great coil .
adieu be vigitant , i beseech you .
exeunt dogberry and verges enter borachio and conrade what conrade !
aside peace !
stir not .
conrade , i say !
here , man , i am at thy elbow .
mass , and my elbow itched , i thought there would a scab follow .
i will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy tale .
stand thee close , then , under this , for it drizzles rain , and i will , like a true drunkard , utter all to thee .
aside some treason , masters yet stand close .
therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats .
is it possible that any villany should be so dear ?
thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich , for when rich villains have need of poor ones , poor ones may make what price they will .
i wonder at it .
that shows thou art unconfirmed .
thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet , or a hat , or a cloak , is nothing to a man .
yes , it is apparel .
i mean , the fashion .
yes , the fashion is the fashion .
tush !
i may as well say the fool the fool .
but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is ?
aside i know that deformed , a ' has been a vile thief this seven year , a ' goes up and down like a gentleman i remember his name .
didst thou not hear somebody ?
no , was the vane on the house .
seest thou not , i say , what a deformed thief this fashion is ?
how giddily a ' turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and ?
sometimes fashioning them like pharaoh soldiers in the reeky painting , sometime like god bel priests in the old , sometime like the shaven hercules in the smirched tapestry , where his codpiece seems as massy as his club ?
all this i see , and i see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man .
but art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too , that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion ?
not so , neither but know that i have wooed margaret , the lady hero gentlewoman , by the name of hero she leans me out at her mistress ' , bids me a thousand times good night , i tell this tale vilely i should first tell thee how the prince , claudio and my master , planted and placed and possessed by my master don john , saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter .
and thought they margaret was hero ?
two of them did , the prince and claudio , but the devil my master knew she was margaret , and partly by his oaths , which first possessed them , partly by the dark night , which did deceive them , but chiefly by my villany , which did confirm any slander that don john had made , away went claudio enraged , swore he would meet her , as he was appointed , next morning at the temple , and there , before the whole congregation , shame her with what he saw night and send her home again without a husband .
we charge you , in the prince name , stand !
call up the right master constable .
we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth .
and one deformed is one of them i know him , a ' wears a lock .
masters , masters , you be made bring deformed forth , i warrant you .
masters , never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us .
we are like to prove a goodly commodity , being taken up of these men bills .
a commodity in question , i warrant you .
come , we obey you .
exeunt scene iv .
hero apartment .
enter hero , margaret , and ursula good ursula , wake my cousin beatrice , and desire her to rise .
i will , lady .
and bid her come hither .
well .
exit troth , i think your other rabato were better .
no , pray thee , good meg , i wear this .
by my troth , not so good , and i warrant your cousin will say so .
my cousin a fool , and thou art another i wear none but this .
i like the new tire within excellently , if the hair were a thought browner , and your gown a most rare fashion , i ' faith .
i saw the duchess of milan gown that they praise so .
o , that exceeds , they say .
by my troth , but a in respect of yours cloth o ' gold , and cuts , and laced with silver , set with pearls , down sleeves , side sleeves , and skirts , round underborne with a bluish tinsel but for a fine , quaint , graceful and excellent fashion , yours is worth ten on .
god give me joy to wear it !
for my heart is exceeding heavy .
be heavier soon by the weight of a man .
fie upon thee !
art not ashamed ?
of what , lady ?
of speaking honourably ?
is not marriage honourable in a beggar ?
is not your lord honourable without marriage ?
i think you would have me say , your reverence , a husband ' and bad thinking do not wrest true speaking , i offend nobody is there any harm in heavier for a husband ' ?
none , i think , and it be the right husband and the right wife , otherwise is light , and not heavy ask my lady beatrice else , here she comes .
enter beatrice good morrow , coz .
good morrow , sweet hero .
why how now ?
do you speak in the sick tune ?
i am out of all other tune , methinks .
clap into o ' love , ' that goes without a burden do you sing it , and i dance it .
ye light o ' love , with your heels !
then , if your husband have stables enough , you see he shall lack no barns .
o illegitimate construction !
i scorn that with my heels .
is almost five , cousin , tis time you were ready .
by my troth , i am exceeding ill !
for a hawk , a horse , or a husband ?
for the letter that begins them all , well , and you be not turned turk , there no more sailing by the star .
what means the fool , trow ?
nothing i , but god send every one their heart desire !
these gloves the count sent me , they are an excellent perfume .
i am stuffed , cousin , i can not smell .
a maid , and stuffed !
there goodly catching of cold .
o , god help me !
god help me !
how long have you professed apprehension ?
even since you left it .
doth not my wit become me rarely ?
it is not seen enough , you should wear it in your cap .
by my troth , i am sick .
get you some of this distilled carduus benedictus , and lay it to your heart it is the only thing for a qualm .
there thou prickest her with a thistle .
benedictus !
why benedictus ?
you have some moral in this benedictus .
moral !
no , by my troth , i have no moral meaning , i meant , plain .
you may think perchance that i think you are in love nay , by ' r lady , i am not such a fool to think what i list , nor i list not to think what i can , nor indeed i can not think , if i would think my heart out of thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love .
yet benedick was such another , and now is he become a man he swore he would never marry , and yet now , in despite of his heart , he eats his meat without grudging and how you may be converted i know not , but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do .
what pace is this that thy tongue keeps ?
not a false gallop .
ursula madam , withdraw the prince , the count , signior benedick , don john , and all the gallants of the town , are come to fetch you to church .
help to dress me , good coz , good meg , good ursula .
exeunt scene another room in leonato house .
enter leonato , with dogberry and verges what would you with me , honest neighbour ?
marry , sir , i would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly .
brief , i pray you , for you see it is a busy time with me .
marry , this it is , sir .
yes , in truth it is , sir .
what is it , my good friends ?
goodman verges , sir , speaks a little off the matter an old man , sir , and his wits are not so blunt as , god help , i would desire they were , but , in faith , honest as the skin between his brows .
yes , i thank god i am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than i .
comparisons are odorous palabras , neighbour verges .
neighbours , you are tedious .
it pleases your worship to say so , but we are the poor duke officers , but truly , for mine own part , if i were as tedious as a king , i could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship .
all thy tediousness on me , ah ?
yea , an a thousand pound more than is , for i hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city , and though i be but a poor man , i am glad to hear it .
and so am i .
i would fain know what you have to say .
marry , sir , our watch , excepting your worship presence , ha ' a couple of as arrant knaves as any in messina .
a good old man , sir , he will be talking as they say , when the age is in , the wit is out god help us !
it is a world to see .
well said , i ' faith , neighbour verges well , god a good man , an two men ride of a horse , one must ride behind .
an honest soul , i ' faith , sir , by my troth he is , as ever broke bread , but god is to be worshipped , all men are not alike , alas , good neighbour !
indeed , neighbour , he comes too short of you .
gifts that god gives .
i must leave you .
one word , sir our watch , sir , have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons , and we would have them this morning examined before your worship .
take their examination yourself and bring it me i am now in great haste , as it may appear unto you .
it shall be suffigance .
drink some wine ere you go fare you well .
enter a messenger my lord , they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband .
i wait upon them i am ready .
exeunt leonato and messenger go , good partner , go , get you to francis seacole , bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol we are now to examination these men .
and we must do it wisely .
we will spare for no wit , i warrant you , here that shall drive some of them to a only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication and meet me at the gaol .
exeunt act iv scene i .
a church .
enter don pedro , don john , leonato , friar francis , claudio , benedick , hero , beatrice , and attendants come , friar francis , be brief , only to the plain form of marriage , and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards .
you come hither , my lord , to marry this lady .
no .
to be married to her friar , you come to marry her .
lady , you come hither to be married to this count .
i do .
if either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined , charge you , on your souls , to utter it .
know you any , hero ?
none , my lord .
know you any , count ?
i dare make his answer , none .
o , what men dare do !
what men may do !
what men daily do , not knowing what they do !
how now !
interjections ?
why , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he !
stand thee by , friar .
father , by your leave will you with free and unconstrained soul give me this maid , your daughter ?
as freely , son , as god did give her me .
and what have i to give you back , whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift ?
nothing , unless you render her again .
sweet prince , you learn me noble thankfulness .
there , leonato , take her back again give not this rotten orange to your friend , she but the sign and semblance of her honour .
behold how like a maid she blushes here !
o , what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal !
comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue ?
would you not swear , all you that see her , that she were a maid , by these exterior shows ?
but she is none she knows the heat of a luxurious bed , her blush is guiltiness , not modesty .
what do you mean , my lord ?
not to be married , not to knit my soul to an approved wanton .
dear my lord , if you , in your own proof , have vanquish the resistance of her youth , and made defeat of her virginity , i know what you would say if i have known her , you will say she did embrace me as a husband , and so extenuate the sin no , leonato , i never tempted her with word too large , but , as a brother to his sister , show bashful sincerity and comely love .
and seem i ever otherwise to you ?
out on thee !
seeming !
i will write against it you seem to me as dian in her orb , as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown , but you are more intemperate in your blood than venus , or those pamper animals that rage in savage sensuality .
is my lord well , that he doth speak so wide ?
sweet prince , why speak not you ?
what should i speak ?
i stand dishonour , that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale .
are these things spoken , or do i but dream ?
sir , they are spoken , and these things are true .
this looks not like a nuptial .
true !
o god !
leonato , stand i here ?
is this the prince ?
is this the prince brother ?
is this face hero ?
are our eyes our own ?
all this is so but what of this , my lord ?
let me but move one question to your daughter , and , by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her , bid her answer truly .
i charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
o , god defend me !
how am i beset !
what kind of catechising call you this ?
to make you answer truly to your name .
is it not hero ?
who can blot that name with any just reproach ?
marry , that can hero , hero itself can blot out hero virtue .
what man was he talk with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one ?
now , if you are a maid , answer to this .
i talk with no man at that hour , my lord .
why , then are you no maiden .
leonato , i am sorry you must hear upon mine honour , myself , my brother and this grieved count did see her , hear her , at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her who hath indeed , most like a liberal villain , confess the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret .
fie , fie !
they are not to be named , my lord , not to be spoke of , there is not chastity enough in language without offence to utter them .
thus , pretty lady , i am sorry for thy much misgovernment .
o hero , what a hero hadst thou been , if half thy outward graces had been placed about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart !
but fare thee well , most foul , most fair !
farewell , thou pure impiety and impious purity !
for thee i lock up all the gates of love , and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang , to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm , and never shall it more be gracious .
hath no man dagger here a point for me ?
hero swoons why , how now , cousin !
wherefore sink you down ?
come , let us go .
these things , come thus to light , smother her spirits up .
exeunt don pedro , don john , and claudio how doth the lady ?
dead , i think .
help , uncle !
hero !
why , hero !
uncle !
signior benedick !
friar !
o fate !
take not away thy heavy hand .
death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wish for .
how now , cousin hero !
have comfort , lady .
dost thou look up ?
yea , wherefore should she not ?
wherefore !
why , doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her ?
could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood ?
do not live , hero , do not ope thine eyes for , did i think thou wouldst not quickly die , thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames , myself would , on the rearward of reproaches , strike at thy life .
grieved i , i had but one ?
chid i for that at frugal nature frame ?
o , one too much by thee !
why had i one ?
why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?
why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar issue at my gates , who smirch thus and mired with infamy , i might have said part of it is mine , this shame derives itself from unknown loins ' ?
but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on , mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine , valuing of her , why , she , o , she is fallen into a pit of ink , that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her flesh !
sir , sir , be patient .
for my part , i am so attired in wonder , i know not what to say .
o , on my soul , my cousin is belied !
lady , were you her bedfellow last night ?
no , truly not , although , until last night , i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .
confirm , confirm !
o , that is stronger made which was before barr up with ribs of iron !
would the two princes lie , and claudio lie , who loved her so , that , speaking of her foulness , wash it with tears ?
hence from her !
let her die .
hear me a little , for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune .
by noting of the lady i have mark a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face , a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes , and in her eye there hath appear a fire , to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth .
call me a fool , trust not my reading nor my observations , which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenor of my book , trust not my age , my reverence , calling , nor divinity , if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error .
friar , it can not be .
thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury , she not denies it why thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness ?
lady , what man is he you are accused of ?
they know that do accuse me , i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant , let all my sins lack mercy !
o my father , prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet , or that i yesternight maintain the change of words with any creature , refuse me , hate me , torture me to death !
there is some strange misprision in the princes .
two of them have the very bent of honour , and if their wisdoms be misled in this , the practise of it lives in john the bastard , whose spirits toil in frame of villanies .
i know not .
if they speak but truth of her , these hands shall tear her , if they wrong her honour , the proudest of them shall well hear of it .
time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine , nor age so eat up my invention , nor fortune made such havoc of my means , nor my bad life reft me so much of friends , but they shall find , awaked in such a kind , both strength of limb and policy of mind , ability in means and choice of friends , to quit me of them throughly .
pause awhile , and let my counsel sway you in this case .
your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in , and publish it that she is dead indeed , maintain a mourning ostentation and on your family old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial .
what shall become of this ?
what will this do ?
marry , this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse , that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course , but on this travail look for greater birth .
she dying , as it must so be maintain , upon the instant that she was accused , shall be lamented , pitied and excused of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it , but being lack and lost , why , then we rack the value , then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours .
so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words , the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination , and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparell in more precious habit , more and full of life , into the eye and prospect of his soul , than when she lived indeed , then shall he mourn , if ever love had interest in his liver , and wish he had not so accused her , no , though he thought his accusation true .
let this be so , and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood .
but if all aim but this be levell false , the supposition of the lady death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well , you may conceal her , as best befits her wounded reputation , in some reclusive and religious life , out of all eyes , tongues , minds and injuries .
signior leonato , let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio , yet , by mine honour , i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body .
being that i flow in grief , the smallest twine may lead me .
is well consented presently away , for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure .
come , lady , die to live this perhaps is but prolong have patience and endure .
exeunt all but benedick and beatrice lady beatrice , have you wept all this while ?
yea , and i will weep a while longer .
i will not desire that .
you have no reason , i do it freely .
surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
is there any way to show such friendship ?
a very even way , but no such friend .
may a man do it ?
it is a man office , but not yours .
i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange ?
as strange as the thing i know not .
it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not , and yet i lie not , i confess nothing , nor i deny nothing .
i am sorry for my cousin .
by my sword , beatrice , thou lovest me .
do not swear , and eat it .
i will swear by it that you love me , and i will make him eat it that says i love not you .
will you not eat your word ?
with no sauce that can be devised to it .
i protest i love thee .
why , then , god forgive me !
what offence , sweet beatrice ?
you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you .
and do it with all thy heart .
i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
come , bid me do any thing for thee .
kill claudio .
ha !
not for the wide world .
you kill me to deny it .
farewell .
tarry , sweet beatrice .
i am gone , though i am here there is no love in you nay , i pray you , let me go .
beatrice , in faith , i will go .
we be friends first .
you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .
is claudio thine enemy ?
is he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonoured my kinswoman ?
o that i were a man !
what , bear her in hand until they come to take hands , and then , with public accusation , uncovered slander , unmitigated rancour , o god , that i were a man !
i would eat his heart in the .
hear me , beatrice , talk with a man out at a window !
a proper saying !
nay , but , beatrice , sweet hero !
she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
beat princes and counties !
surely , a princely testimony , a goodly count , count comfect , a sweet gallant , surely !
o that i were a man for his sake !
or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake !
but manhood is melted into courtesies , valour into compliment , and men are only turned into tongue , and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it .
i can not be a man with wishing , therefore i will die a woman with grieving .
tarry , good beatrice .
by this hand , i love thee .
use it for my love some other way than swearing by it .
think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero ?
yea , as sure as i have a thought or a soul .
enough , i am engaged , i will challenge him .
i will kiss your hand , and so i leave you .
by this hand , claudio shall render me a dear account .

flat burglary as ever was committed .
yea , by mass , that it is .

and not marry her .

master constable , let these men be bound , and brought to leonato i will go before and show him their examination .
exit come , let them be opinioned .

o that he were here to write me down an ass !
but , masters , remember that i am an ass , though it be not written down , yet forget not that i am an ass .
no , thou villain , thou art full of piety , as shall be proved upon thee by good witness .
i am a wise fellow , and , which is more , an officer , and , which is more , a householder , and , which is more , as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in messina , and one that knows the law , go to , and a rich fellow enough , go to , and a fellow that hath had losses , and one that hath two gowns and every thing handsome about him .
bring him away .
o that i had been writ down an ass !
exeunt act v scene i .
before leonato house .
enter leonato and antonio if you go on thus , you will kill yourself and is not wisdom thus to second grief against yourself .
i pray thee , cease thy counsel , which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel , nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine .
bring me a father that so loved his child , whose joy of her is overwhelm like mine , and bid him speak of patience , measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain , as thus for thus and such a grief for such , in every lineament , branch , shape , and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard , bid sorrow wag , cry ! '
when he should groan , patch grief with proverbs , make misfortune drunk with , bring him yet to me , and i of him will gather patience .
but there is no such man for , brother , men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel , but , tasting it , their counsel turns to passion , which before would give preceptial medicine to rage , fetter strong madness in a silken thread , charm ache with air and agony with words no , no , is all men office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow , but no man virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself .
therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement .
therein do men from children nothing differ .
i pray thee , peace .
i will be flesh and blood , for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently , however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance .
yet bend not all the harm upon yourself , make those that do offend you suffer too .
there thou reason nay , i will do so .
my soul doth tell me hero is belied , and that shall claudio know , so shall the prince and all of them that thus dishonour her .
here comes the prince and claudio hastily .
enter don pedro and claudio good den , good den .
good day to both of you .
hear you .
my lords , we have some haste , leonato .
some haste , my lord !
well , fare you well , my lord are you so hasty now ?
well , all is one .
nay , do not quarrel with us , good old man .
if he could right himself with quarreling , some of us would lie low .
who wrongs him ?
marry , thou dost wrong me , thou dissembler , thou nay , never lay thy hand upon thy sword , i fear thee not .
marry , beshrew my hand , if it should give your age such cause of fear in faith , my hand meant nothing to my sword .
tush , tush , man , never fleer and jest at me i speak not like a dotard nor a fool , as under privilege of age to brag what i have done being young , or what would do were i not old .
know , claudio , to thy head , thou hast so wrong mine innocent child and me that i am forced to lay my reverence by and , with grey hairs and bruise of many days , do challenge thee to trial of a man .
i say thou hast belied mine innocent child , thy slander hath gone through and through her heart , and she lies buried with her ancestors , o , in a tomb where never scandal slept , save this of hers , framed by thy villany !
my villany ?
thine , claudio , thine , i say .
you say not right , old man .
my lord , my lord , i prove it on his body , if he dare , despite his nice fence and his active practise , his may of youth and bloom of lustihood .
away !
i will not have to do with you .
canst thou so daff me ?
thou hast kill my child if thou me , boy , thou shalt kill a man .
he shall kill two of us , and men indeed but that no matter , let him kill one first , win me and wear me , let him answer me .
come , follow me , boy , come , sir boy , come , follow me sir boy , i whip you from your foining fence , nay , as i am a gentleman , i will .
brother , content yourself .
god knows i loved my niece , and she is dead , slander to death by villains , that dare as well answer a man indeed as i dare take a serpent by the tongue boys , apes , braggarts , jacks , milksops !
brother antony , hold you content .
what , man !
i know them , yea , and what they weigh , even to the utmost scruple , scrambling , , boys , that lie and cog and flout , deprave and slander , go anticly , show outward hideousness , and speak off half a dozen dangerous words , how they might hurt their enemies , if they durst , and this is all .
but , brother antony , come , is no matter do not you meddle , let me deal in this .
gentlemen both , we will not wake your patience .
my heart is sorry for your daughter death but , on my honour , she was charged with nothing but what was true and very full of proof .
my lord , my lord , i will not hear you .
no ?
come , brother , away !
i will be heard .
and shall , or some of us will smart for it .
exeunt leonato and antonio see , see , here comes the man we went to seek .
enter benedick now , signior , what news ?
good day , my lord .
welcome , signior you are almost come to part almost a fray .
we had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth .
leonato and his brother .
what thinkest thou ?
had we fought , i doubt we should have been too young for them .
in a false quarrel there is no true valour .
i came to seek you both .
we have been up and down to seek thee , for we are melancholy and would fain have it beaten away .
wilt thou use thy wit ?
it is in my scabbard shall i draw it ?
dost thou wear thy wit by thy side ?
never any did so , though very many have been beside their wit .
i will bid thee draw , as we do the minstrels , draw , to pleasure us .
as i am an honest man , he looks pale .
art thou sick , or angry ?
what , courage , man !
what though care killed a cat , thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care .
sir , i shall meet your wit in the career , and you charge it against me .
i pray you choose another subject .
nay , then , give him another staff this last was broke cross .
by this light , he changes more and more i think he be angry indeed .
if he be , he knows how to turn his girdle .
shall i speak a word in your ear ?
god bless me from a challenge !
aside to claudio you are a villain , i jest not i will make it good how you dare , with what you dare , and when you dare .
do me right , or i will protest your cowardice .
you have killed a sweet lady , and her death shall fall heavy on you .
let me hear from you .
well , i will meet you , so i may have good cheer .
what , a feast , a feast ?
i ' faith , i thank him , he hath bid me to a calf head and a capon , the which if i do not carve most curiously , say my knife naught .
shall i not find a woodcock too ?
sir , your wit ambles well , it goes easily .
i tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the other day .
i said , thou hadst a fine wit , ' said she , ' a fine little one . '
, ' said i , ' a great wit ' , ' says she , ' a great gross one . '
, ' said i , ' a good wit ' , ' said she , hurts nobody . '
, ' said i , gentleman is wise ' , ' said she , ' a wise gentleman . '
, ' said i , hath the tongues ' i believe , ' said she , he swore a thing to me on monday night , which he forswore on tuesday morning , there a double tongue , there two tongues . '
thus did she , an hour together , transshape thy particular virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh , thou wast the properest man in italy .
for the which she wept heartily and said she cared not .
yea , that she did but yet , for all that , an if she did not hate him deadly , she would love him dearly the old man daughter told us all .
all , all , and , moreover , god saw him when he was hid in the garden .
but when shall we set the savage bull horns on the sensible benedick head ?
yea , and text underneath , dwells benedick the married man ' ?
fare you well , boy you know my mind .
i will leave you now to your humour you break jests as braggarts do their blades , which god be thanked , hurt not .
my lord , for your many courtesies i thank you i must discontinue your company your brother the bastard is fled from messina you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady .
for my lord lackbeard there , he and i shall meet and , till then , peace be with him .
exit he is in earnest .
in most profound earnest , and , i warrant you , for the love of beatrice .
and hath challenged thee .
most sincerely .
what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit !
he is then a giant to an ape , but then is an ape a doctor to such a man .
but , soft you , let me be pluck up , my heart , and be sad .
did he not say , my brother was fled ?
enter dogberry , verges , and the watch , with conrade and borachio come you , sir if justice can not tame you , she shall weigh more reasons in her balance nay , an you be a cursing hypocrite once , you must be looked to .
how now ?
two of my brother men bound !
borachio one !
hearken after their offence , my lord .
officers , what offence have these men done ?
marry , sir , they have committed false report , moreover , they have spoken untruths , secondarily , they are slanders , sixth and lastly , they have belied a lady , thirdly , they have verified unjust things , and , to conclude , they are lying knaves .
first , i ask thee what they have done , thirdly , i ask thee what their offence , sixth and lastly , why they are committed , and , to conclude , what you lay to their charge .
rightly reasoned , and in his own division and , by my troth , there one meaning well suited .
who have you offended , masters , that you are thus bound to your answer ?
this learned constable is too cunning to be understood what your offence ?
sweet prince , let me go no farther to mine answer do you hear me , and let this count kill me .
i have deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover , these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how don john your brother incensed me to slander the lady hero , how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero garments , how you disgraced her , when you should marry her my villany they have upon record , which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame .
the lady is dead upon mine and my master false accusation , and , briefly , i desire nothing but the reward of a villain .
runs not this speech like iron through your blood ?
i have drunk poison whiles he utter it .
but did my brother set thee on to this ?
yea , and paid me richly for the practise of it .
he is composed and framed of treachery and fled he is upon this villany .
sweet hero !
now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that i loved it first .
come , bring away the plaintiffs by this time our sexton hath reformed signior leonato of the matter and , masters , do not forget to specify , when time and place shall serve , that i am an ass .
here , here comes master signior leonato , and the sexton too .
leonato and antonio , with the sexton which is the villain ?
let me see his eyes , that , when i note another man like him , i may avoid him which of these is he ?
if you would know your wronger , look on me .
art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill mine innocent child ?
yea , even i alone .
no , not so , villain , thou beliest thyself here stand a pair of honourable men , a third is fled , that had a hand in it .
i thank you , princes , for my daughter death record it with your high and worthy deeds was bravely done , if you bethink you of it .
i know not how to pray your patience , yet i must speak .
choose your revenge yourself , impose me to what penance your invention can lay upon my sin yet sinn i not but in mistaking .
by my soul , nor i and yet , to satisfy this good old man , i would bend under any heavy weight that he enjoin me to .
i can not bid you bid my daughter live , that were impossible but , i pray you both , possess the people in messina here how innocent she died , and if your love can labour ought in sad invention , hang her an epitaph upon her tomb and sing it to her bones , sing it morning come you to my house , and since you could not be my , be yet my nephew my brother hath a daughter , almost the copy of my child that dead , and she alone is heir to both of us give her the right you should have given her cousin , and so dies my revenge .
o noble sir , your doth wring tears from me !
i do embrace your offer , and dispose for henceforth of poor claudio .
then i will expect your coming , i take my leave .
this naughty man shall face to face be brought to margaret , who i believe was pack in all this wrong , hired to it by your brother .
no , by my soul , she was not , nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me , but always hath been just and virtuous in any thing that i do know by her .
moreover , sir , which indeed is not under white and black , this plaintiff here , the offender , did call me ass i beseech you , let it be remembered in his punishment .
and also , the watch heard them talk of one deformed they say be wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it , and borrows money in god name , the which he hath used so long and never paid that now men grow and will lend nothing for god sake pray you , examine him upon that point .
i thank thee for thy care and honest pains .
your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth , and i praise god for you .
there for thy pains .
god save the foundation !
go , i discharge thee of thy prisoner , and i thank thee .
i leave an arrant knave with your worship , which i beseech your worship to correct yourself , for the example of others .
god keep your worship !
i wish your worship well , god restore you to health !
i humbly give you leave to depart , and if a merry meeting may be wished , god prohibit it !
come , neighbour .
exeunt dogberry and verges until morning , lords , farewell .
farewell , my lords we look for you .
we will not fail .
i mourn with hero .
to the watch bring you these fellows on .
we talk with margaret , how her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow .
exeunt , severally scene ii .
leonato garden .
enter benedick and margaret , meeting pray thee , sweet mistress margaret , deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice .
will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty ?
in so high a style , margaret , that no man living shall come over it , for , in most comely truth , thou deservest it .
to have no man come over me !
why , shall i always keep below stairs ?
thy wit is as quick as the greyhound mouth , it catches .
and yours as blunt as the fencer foils , which hit , but hurt not .
a most manly wit , margaret , it will not hurt a woman and so , i pray thee , call beatrice i give thee the bucklers .
give us the swords , we have bucklers of our own .
if you use them , margaret , you must put in the pikes with a vice , and they are dangerous weapons for maids .
well , i will call beatrice to you , who i think hath legs .
and therefore will come .
exit margaret sings the god of love , that sits above , and knows me , and knows me , how pitiful i deserve , i mean in singing , but in loving , leander the good swimmer , troilus the first employer of panders , and a whole bookful of these quondam , whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse , why , they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love .
marry , i can not show it in rhyme , i have tried i can find out no rhyme to ' but , ' an innocent rhyme , for , ' , ' a hard rhyme , for , , ' , ' a babbling rhyme , very ominous endings no , i was not born under a rhyming planet , nor i can not woo in festival terms .
enter beatrice sweet beatrice , wouldst thou come when i called thee ?
yea , signior , and depart when you bid me .
o , stay but till then !
' is spoken , fare you well now and yet , ere i go , let me go with that i came , which is , with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio .
only foul words , and thereupon i will kiss thee .
foul words is but foul wind , and foul wind is but foul breath , and foul breath is noisome , therefore i will depart unkissed .
thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense , so forcible is thy wit .
but i must tell thee plainly , claudio undergoes my challenge , and either i must shortly hear from him , or i will subscribe him a coward .
and , i pray thee now , tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me ?
for them all together , which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them .
but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me ?
suffer love !
a good epithet !
i do suffer love indeed , for i love thee against my will .
in spite of your heart , i think , alas , poor heart !
if you spite it for my sake , i will spite it for yours , for i will never love that which my friend hates .
thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably .
it appears not in this confession there not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself .
an old , an old instance , beatrice , that lived in the lime of good neighbours .
if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies , he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps .
and how long is that , think you ?
question why , an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore is it most expedient for the wise , if don worm , his conscience , find no impediment to the contrary , to be the trumpet of his own virtues , as i am to myself .
so much for praising myself , who , i myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy and now tell me , how doth your cousin ?
very and how do you ?
very ill too .
serve god , love me and mend .
there will i leave you too , for here comes one in haste .
enter ursula madam , you must come to your uncle .
yonder old coil at home it is proved my lady hero hath been falsely accused , the prince and claudio mightily abused , and don john is the author of all , who is fed and gone .
will you come presently ?
will you go hear this news , signior ?
i will live in thy heart , die in thy lap , and be buried in thy eyes , and moreover i will go with thee to thy uncle .
exeunt scene iii .
a church .
enter don pedro , claudio , and three or four with tapers is this the monument of leonato ?
it is , my lord .
reading out of a scroll done to death by slanderous tongues was the hero that here lies death , in guerdon of her wrongs , gives her fame which never dies .
so the life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame .
hang thou there upon the tomb , praising her when i am dumb .
now , music , sound , and sing your solemn hymn .
song .
pardon , goddess of the night , those that slew thy virgin knight , for the which , with songs of woe , round about her tomb they go .
midnight , assist our moan , help us to sigh and groan , heavily , heavily graves , yawn and yield your dead , till death be uttered , heavily , heavily .
now , unto thy bones good night !
yearly will i do this rite .
good morrow , masters , put your torches out the wolves have prey , and look , the gentle day , before the wheels of phoebus , round about dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey .
thanks to you all , and leave us fare you well .
good morrow , masters each his several way .
come , let us hence , and put on other weeds , and then to leonato we will go .
and hymen now with luckier issue speed than this for whom we render up this woe .
exeunt scene iv .
a room in leonato house .
enter leonato , antonio , benedick , beatrice , margaret , ursula , friar francis , and hero did i not tell you she was innocent ?
so are the prince and claudio , who accused her upon the error that you heard debated but margaret was in some fault for this , although against her will , as it appears in the true course of all the question .
well , i am glad that all things sort so well .
and so am i , being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it .
well , daughter , and you all , withdraw into a chamber by yourselves , and when i send for you , come hither mask .
exeunt ladies the prince and claudio promised by this hour to visit me .
you know your office , brother you must be father to your brother daughter and give her to young claudio .
which i will do with confirm countenance .
friar , i must entreat your pains , i think .
to do what , signior ?
to bind me , or undo me , one of them .
signior leonato , truth it is , good signior , your niece regards me with an eye of favour .
that eye my daughter lent her is most true .
and i do with an eye of love requite her .
the sight whereof i think you had from me , from claudio and the prince but what your will ?
your answer , sir , is enigmatical but , for my will , my will is your good will may stand with ours , this day to be conjoin in the state of honourable marriage in which , good friar , i shall desire your help .
my heart is with your liking .
and my help .
here comes the prince and claudio .
enter don pedro and claudio , and two or three others good morrow to this fair assembly .
good morrow , prince , good morrow , claudio we here attend you .
are you yet determined to marry with my brother daughter ?
i hold my mind , were she an ethiope .
call her forth , brother , here the friar ready .
exit antonio good morrow , benedick .
why , what the matter , that you have such a february face , so full of frost , of storm and cloudiness ?
i think he thinks upon the savage bull .
tush , fear not , man , we tip thy horns with gold and all europa shall rejoice at thee , as once europa did at lusty jove , when he would play the noble beast in love .
bull jove , sir , had an amiable low , and some such strange bull leap your father cow , and got a calf in that same noble feat much like to you , for you have just his bleat .
for this i owe you here comes other reckonings .
antonio , with the ladies masked which is the lady i must seize upon ?
this same is she , and i do give you her .
why , then she mine .
sweet , let me see your face .
no , that you shall not , till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her .
give me your hand before this holy friar , i am your husband , if you like of me .
and when i lived , i was your other wife unmasking and when you loved , you were my other husband .
another hero !
nothing certainer one hero died defiled , but i do live , and surely as i live , i am a maid .
the former hero !
hero that is dead !
she died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .
all this amazement can i qualify when after that the holy rites are ended , i tell you largely of fair hero death meantime let wonder seem familiar , and to the chapel let us presently .
soft and fair , friar .
which is beatrice ?
unmasking i answer to that name .
what is your will ?
do not you love me ?
why , no , no more than reason .
why , then your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived , they swore you did .
do not you love me ?
troth , no , no more than reason .
why , then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived , for they did swear you did .
they swore that you were almost sick for me .
they swore that you were dead for me .
is no such matter .
then you do not love me ?
no , truly , but in friendly recompense .
come , cousin , i am sure you love the gentleman .
and i be sworn upo that he loves her , for here a paper written in his hand , a halting sonnet of his own pure brain , fashion to beatrice .
and here another writ in my cousin hand , stolen from her pocket , containing her affection unto benedick .
a miracle !
here our own hands against our hearts .
come , i will have thee , but , by this light , i take thee for pity .
i would not deny you , but , by this good day , i yield upon great persuasion , and partly to save your life , for i was told you were in a consumption .
peace !
i will stop your mouth .
kissing her how dost thou , benedick , the married man ?
i tell thee what , prince , a college of can not flout me out of my humour .
dost thou think i care for a satire or an epigram ?
no if a man will be beaten with brains , a ' shall wear nothing handsome about him .
in brief , since i do purpose to marry , i will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it , and therefore never flout at me for what i have said against it , for man is a giddy thing , and this is my conclusion .
for thy part , claudio , i did think to have beaten thee , but in that thou art like to be my kinsman , live unbruised and love my cousin .
i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice , that i might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life , to make thee a , which , out of question , thou wilt be , if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to thee .
come , come , we are friends let have a dance ere we are married , that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives ' heels .
we have dancing afterward .
first , of my word , therefore play , music .
prince , thou art sad , get thee a wife , get thee a wife there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn .
enter a messenger my lord , your brother john is in flight , and brought with armed men back to messina .
think not on him till i devise thee brave punishments for him .
strike up , pipers .

a street .
enter roderigo and iago tush !
never tell me , i take it much unkindly that thou , iago , who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine , shouldst know of this .
, but you will not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter , abhor me .
thou me thou didst hold him in thy hate .
despise me , if i do not .
three great ones of the city , in personal suit to make me his lieutenant , to him and , by the faith of man , i know my price , i am worth no worse a place but he , as loving his own pride and purposes , evades them , with a bombast circumstance horribly stuff with epithets of war , and , in conclusion , nonsuits my mediators , for , , ' says he , ' i have already chose my officer . '
and what was he ?
forsooth , a great arithmetician , one michael cassio , a florentine , a fellow almost damn in a fair wife , that never set a squadron in the field , nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster , unless the bookish theoric , wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle , without practise , is all his soldiership .
but he , sir , had the election and i , of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes , at cyprus and on other grounds christian and heathen , must be and calm by debitor and creditor this , he , in good time , must his lieutenant be , and i god bless the mark ! his moorship ancient .
by heaven , i rather would have been his hangman .
why , there no remedy , is the curse of service , preferment goes by letter and affection , and not by old gradation , where each second stood heir to the first .
now , sir , be judge yourself , whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor .
i would not follow him then .
o , sir , content you , i follow him to serve my turn upon him we can not all be masters , nor all masters can not be truly follow .
you shall mark many a duteous and knave , that , doting on his own obsequious bondage , wears out his time , much like his master ass , for nought but provender , and when he old , cashier whip me such honest knaves .
others there are who , trimm in forms and visages of duty , keep yet their hearts attending on themselves , and , throwing but shows of service on their lords , do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul , and such a one do i profess myself .
for , sir , it is as sure as you are roderigo , were i the moor , i would not be iago in following him , i follow but myself , heaven is my judge , not i for love and duty , but seeming so , for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in compliment extern , is not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am .
what a full fortune does the thicklips owe if he can thus !
call up her father , rouse him make after him , poison his delight , proclaim him in the streets , incense her kinsmen , and , though he in a fertile climate dwell , plague him with flies though that his joy be joy , yet throw such changes of vexation o , as it may lose some colour .
here is her father house , i call aloud .
do , with like timorous accent and dire yell as when , by night and negligence , the fire is spied in populous cities .
what , ho , brabantio !
signior brabantio , ho !
awake !
what , ho , brabantio !
thieves !
thieves !
thieves !
look to your house , your daughter and your bags !
thieves !
thieves !
brabantio appears above , at a window what is the reason of this terrible summons ?
what is the matter there ?
signior , is all your family within ?
are your doors lock ?
why , wherefore ask you this ?
, sir , you robb , for shame , put on your gown , your heart is burst , you have lost half your soul , even now , now , very now , an old black ram is topping your white ewe .
arise , arise , awake the snorting citizens with the bell , or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise , i say .
what , have you lost your wits ?
most reverend signior , do you know my voice ?
not i what are you ?
my name is roderigo .
the worser welcome i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee , and now , in madness , being full of supper and distempering draughts , upon malicious bravery , dost thou come to start my quiet .
sir , sir , sir , but thou must needs be sure my spirit and my place have in them power to make this bitter to thee .
patience , good sir .
what thou me of robbing ?
this is venice , my house is not a grange .
most grave brabantio , in simple and pure soul i come to you .
, sir , you are one of those that will not serve god , if the devil bid you .
because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you have your daughter covered with a barbary horse , you have your nephews neigh to you , you have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .
what profane wretch art thou ?
i am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs .
thou art a villain .
you are a senator .
this thou shalt answer , i know thee , roderigo .
sir , i will answer any thing .
but , i beseech you , be your pleasure and most wise consent , as partly i find it is , that your fair daughter , at this and dull watch o ' the night , transported , with no worse nor better guard but with a knave of common hire , a gondolier , to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor if this be known to you and your allowance , we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs , but if you know not this , my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke .
do not believe that , from the sense of all civility , i thus would play and trifle with your reverence your daughter , if you have not given her leave , i say again , hath made a gross revolt , tying her duty , beauty , wit and fortunes in an extravagant and wheeling stranger of here and every where .
straight satisfy yourself if she be in her chamber or your house , let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you .
strike on the tinder , ho !
give me a taper !
call up all my people !
this accident is not unlike my dream belief of it oppresses me already .
light , i say !
light !
exit above farewell , for i must leave you it seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , to be produced as , if i stay , i shall against the moor for , i do know , the state , however this may gall him with some cheque , can not with safety cast him , for he embark with such loud reason to the cyprus wars , which even now stand in act , that , for their souls , another of his fathom they have none , to lead their business in which regard , though i do hate him as i do .
yet , for necessity of present life , i must show out a flag and sign of love , which is indeed but sign .
that you shall surely find him , lead to the sagittary the raised search , and there will i be with him .
so , farewell .
exit enter , below , brabantio , and servants with torches it is too true an evil gone she is , and what to come of my despised time is nought but bitterness .
now , roderigo , where didst thou see her ?
o unhappy girl !
with the moor , thou ?
who would be a father !
how didst thou know was she ?
o she deceives me past thought !
what said she to you ?
get more tapers raise all my kindred .
are they married , think you ?
truly , i think they are .
o heaven !
how got she out ?
o treason of the blood !
fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds by what you see them act .
is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused ?
have you not read , roderigo , of some such thing ?
yes , sir , i have indeed .
call up my brother .
o , would you had had her !
some one way , some another .
do you know where we may apprehend her and the moor ?
i think i can discover him , if you please , to get good guard and go along with me .
pray you , lead on .
at every house i call , i may command at most .
get weapons , ho !
and raise some special officers of night .
on , good roderigo i deserve your pains .
exeunt scene ii .
another street .
enter othello , iago , and attendants with torches though in the trade of war i have slain men , yet do i hold it very stuff o ' the conscience to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought to have yerk him here under the ribs .
is better as it is .
nay , but he prated , and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honour that , with the little godliness i have , i did full hard forbear him .
but , i pray you , sir , are you fast married ?
be assured of this , that the magnifico is much beloved , and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the duke he will divorce you , or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law , with all his might to enforce it on , will give him cable .
let him do his spite my services which i have done the signiory shall his complaints .
is yet to know , which , when i know that boasting is an honour , i shall promulgate i fetch my life and being from men of royal siege , and my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this that i have reach for know , iago , but that i love the gentle desdemona , i would not my unhoused free condition put into circumscription and confine for the sea worth .
but , look !
what lights come yond ?
those are the raised father and his friends you were best go in .
not i i must be found my parts , my title and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly .
is it they ?
by janus , i think no .
enter cassio , and certain officers with torches the servants of the duke , and my lieutenant .
the goodness of the night upon you , friends !
what is the news ?
the duke does greet you , general , and he requires your appearance , even on the instant .
what is the matter , think you ?
something from cyprus as i may divine it is a business of some heat the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another heels , and many of the consuls , raised and met , are at the duke already you have been hotly call for , when , being not at your lodging to be found , the senate hath sent about three several guests to search you out .
is well i am found by you .
i will but spend a word here in the house , and go with you .
exit ancient , what makes he here ?
, he hath boarded a land carack if it prove lawful prize , he made for ever .
i do not understand .
he married .
to who ?
othello marry , to come , captain , will you go ?
have with you .
here comes another troop to seek for you .
it is brabantio .
general , be advised , he comes to bad intent .
enter brabantio , roderigo , and officers with torches and weapons holla !
stand there !
signior , it is the moor .
down with him , thief !
they draw on both sides you , roderigo !
come , sir , i am for you .
keep up your bright swords , for the dew will rust them .
good signior , you shall more command with years than with your weapons .
o thou foul thief , where hast thou stow my daughter ?
damn as thou art , thou hast enchanted her , for i refer me to all things of sense , if she in chains of magic were not bound , whether a maid so tender , fair and happy , so opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curled darlings of our nation , would ever have , to incur a general mock , run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou , to fear , not to delight .
judge me the world , if is not gross in sense that thou hast practised on her with foul charms , abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weaken motion i disputed on , is probable and palpable to thinking .
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world , a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant .
lay hold upon him if he do resist , subdue him at his peril .
hold your hands , both you of my inclining , and the rest were it my cue to fight , i should have known it without a prompter .
where will you that i go to answer this your charge ?
to prison , till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer .
what if i do obey ?
how may the duke be therewith satisfied , whose messengers are here about my side , upon some present business of the state to bring me to him ?
is true , most worthy signior , the duke in council and your noble self , i am sure , is sent for .
how !
the duke in council !
in this time of the night !
bring him away mine not an idle cause the duke himself , or any of my brothers of the state , can not but feel this wrong as their own , for if such actions may have passage free , and pagans shall our statesmen be .
exeunt scene iii .
a .
the duke and senators sitting at a table , officers attending there is no composition in these news that gives them credit .
indeed , they are disproportion , my letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
and mine , a hundred and forty .
and mine , two hundred but though they jump not on a just account , as in these cases , where the aim reports , is oft with difference yet do they all confirm a turkish fleet , and bearing up to cyprus .
nay , it is possible enough to judgment i do not so secure me in the error , but the main article i do approve in fearful sense .
within what , ho !
what , ho !
what , ho !
a messenger from the galleys .
enter a sailor now , what the business ?
the turkish preparation makes for rhodes , so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo .
how say you by this change ?
this can not be , by no assay of reason is a pageant , to keep us in false gaze .
when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk , and let ourselves again but understand , that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes , so may he with more facile question bear it , for that it stands not in such warlike brace , but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dress in if we make thought of this , we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first , neglecting an attempt of ease and gain , to wake and wage a danger profitless .
nay , in all confidence , he not for rhodes .
here is more news .
enter a messenger the ottomites , reverend and gracious , steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes , have there injointed them with an after fleet .
ay , so i thought .
how many , as you guess ?
of thirty sail and now they do restem their backward course , bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus .
signior montano , your trusty and most valiant servitor , with his free duty recommends you thus , and prays you to believe him .
is certain , then , for cyprus .
marcus luccicos , is not he in town ?
he now in florence .
write from us to him , dispatch .
here comes brabantio and the valiant moor .
enter brabantio , othello , iago , roderigo , and officers valiant othello , we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman .
to brabantio i did not see you , welcome , gentle signior , we lack your counsel and your help tonight .
so did i yours .
good your grace , pardon me , neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath raised me from my bed , nor doth the general care take hold on me , for my particular grief is of so and nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself .
why , what the matter ?
my daughter !
o , my daughter !
dead ?
ay , to me , she is abused , from me , and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks , for nature so preposterously to err , being not deficient , blind , or lame of sense , sans witchcraft could not .
he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her , the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense , yea , though our proper son stood in your action .
humbly i thank your grace .
here is the man , this moor , whom now , it seems , your special mandate for the hath hither brought .
we are very sorry .
to othello what , in your own part , can you say to this ?
nothing , but this is so .
most potent , grave , and reverend signiors , my very noble and approved good masters , that i have away this old man daughter , it is most true , true , i have married her the very head and front of my offending hath this extent , no more .
rude am i in my speech , and little bless with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years ' pith , till now some nine moons wasted , they have used their dearest action in the tented field , and little of this great world can i speak , more than pertains to feats of broil and battle , and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself .
yet , by your gracious patience , i will a round unvarnish tale deliver of my whole course of love , what drugs , what charms , what conjuration and what mighty magic , for such proceeding i am charged withal , i won his daughter .
a maiden never bold , of spirit so still and quiet , that her motion blush at herself , and she , in spite of nature , of years , of country , credit , every thing , to fall in love with what she fear to look on !
it is a judgment maim and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature , and must be driven to find out practises of cunning hell , why this should be .
i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful the blood , or with some dram conjured to this effect , he wrought upon her .
to vouch this , is no proof , without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him .
but , othello , speak did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid affections ?
or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth ?
i do beseech you , send for the lady to the sagittary , and let her speak of me before her father if you do find me foul in her report , the trust , the office i do hold of you , not only take away , but let your sentence even fall upon my life .
fetch desdemona hither .
ancient , conduct them you best know the place .
exeunt iago and attendants and , till she come , as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood , so justly to your grave ears i present how i did thrive in this fair lady love , and she in mine .
say it , othello .
her father loved me , oft invited me , still question me the story of my life , from year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , that i have passed .
i ran it through , even from my boyish days , to the very moment that he bade me tell it , wherein i spake of most disastrous chances , of moving accidents by flood and field of scapes i ' the imminent deadly breach , of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery , of my redemption thence and portance in my travels ' history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle , rough quarries , rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speak , such was the process , and of the cannibals that each other eat , the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders .
this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch , come again , and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing , took once a pliant hour , and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate , whereof by parcels she had something heard , but not intentively i did consent , and often did beguile her of her tears , when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer .
my story being done , she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore , in faith , twas strange , was passing strange , was pitiful , was wondrous pitiful she wish she had not heard it , yet she wish that heaven had made her such a man she thank me , and bade me , if i had a friend that loved her , i should but teach him how to tell my story .
and that would woo her .
upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had pass , and i loved her that she did pity them .
this only is the witchcraft i have used here comes the lady , let her witness it .
enter desdemona , iago , and attendants i think this tale would win my daughter too .
good brabantio , take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands .
i pray you , hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer , destruction on my head , if my bad blame light on the man !
come hither , gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience ?
my noble father , i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education , my life and education both do learn me how to respect you , you are the lord of duty , i am hitherto your daughter but here my husband , and so much duty as my mother show to you , preferring you before her father , so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord .
god be wi ' you !
i have done .
please it your grace , on to the i had rather to adopt a child than get it .
come hither , moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which , but thou hast already , with all my heart i would keep from thee .
for your sake , jewel , i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny , to hang clogs on them .
i have done , my lord .
let me speak like yourself , and lay a sentence , which , as a grise or step , may help these lovers into your favour .
when remedies are past , the griefs are ended by seeing the worst , which late on hopes depended .
to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on .
what can not be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes .
the robb that smiles steals something from the thief , he robs himself that spends a bootless grief .
so let the turk of cyprus us beguile , we lose it not , so long as we can smile .
he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears , but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that , to pay grief , must of poor patience borrow .
these sentences , to sugar , or to gall , being strong on both sides , are equivocal but words are words , i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear .
i humbly beseech you , proceed to the affairs of state .
the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus .
othello , the fortitude of the place is best known to you , and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency , yet opinion , a sovereign mistress of effects , throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition .
the tyrant custom , most grave senators , hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my bed of down i do agnise a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness , and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites .
most humbly therefore bending to your state , i crave fit disposition for my wife .
due reference of place and exhibition , with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding .
if you please , at her father .
i not have it so .
nor i .
nor i , i would not there reside , to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye .
most gracious duke , to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear , and let me find a charter in your voice , to assist my simpleness .
what would you , desdemona ?
that i did love the moor to live with him , my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othello visage in his mind , and to his honour and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate .
so that , dear lords , if i be left behind , a moth of peace , and he go to the war , the rites for which i love him are bereft me , and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence .
let me go with him .
let her have your voices .
vouch with me , heaven , i therefore beg it not , to please the palate of my appetite , nor to comply with heat the young affects in me defunct and proper satisfaction .
but to be free and bounteous to her mind and heaven defend your good souls , that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me no , when toys of feather cupid seal with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments , that my disports corrupt and taint my business , let housewives make a skillet of my helm , and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation !
be it as you shall privately determine , either for her stay or going the affair cries haste , and speed must answer it .
you must away .
with all my heart .
at nine i ' the morning here we meet again .
othello , leave some officer behind , and he shall our commission bring to you , with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you .
so please your grace , my ancient , a man he is of honest and trust to his conveyance i assign my wife , with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me .
let it be so .
good night to every one .
to brabantio and , noble signior , if virtue no delighted beauty lack , your is far more fair than black .
adieu , brave moor , use desdemona well .
look to her , moor , if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father , and may thee .
exeunt duke of venice , senators , officers , and c my life upon her faith !
honest iago , my desdemona must i leave to thee i prithee , let thy wife attend on her and bring them after in the best advantage .
come , desdemona i have but an hour of love , of worldly matters and direction , to spend with thee we must obey the time .
exeunt othello and desdemona iago , what thou , noble heart ?
what will i do , thinkest thou ?
why , go to bed , and sleep .
i will incontinently drown myself .
if thou dost , i shall never love thee after .
why , thou silly gentleman !
it is silliness to live when to live is torment , and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician .
o villainous !
i have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury , i never found man that knew how to love himself .
ere i would say , i would drown myself for the love of a , i would change my humanity with a baboon .
what should i do ?
i confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it .
virtue !
a fig !
is in ourselves that we are thus or thus .
our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles , or sow lettuce , set hyssop and weed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs , or distract it with many , either to have it sterile with idleness , or manured with industry , why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills .
if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts , whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion .
it can not be .
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
come , be a man .
drown thyself !
drown cats and blind puppies .
i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness , i could never better stead thee than now .
put money in thy purse , follow thou the wars , defeat thy favour with an usurped beard , i say , put money in thy purse .
it can not be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor , put money in thy purse , nor he his to her it was a violent commencement , and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse .
these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts , shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida .
she must change for youth when she is sated with his body , she will find the error of her choice she must have change , she must therefore put money in thy purse .
if thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her , therefore make money .
a pox of drowning thyself !
it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her .
wilt thou be fast to my hopes , if i depend on the issue ?
thou art sure of me go , make money i have told thee often , and i thee again and again , i hate the moor my cause is hearted , thine hath no less reason .
let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him , thou dost thyself a pleasure , me a sport .
there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered .
traverse !
go , provide thy money .
we will have more of this .
adieu .
where shall we meet i ' the morning ?
at my lodging .
i be with thee betimes .
go to , farewell .
do you hear , roderigo ?
what say you ?
no more of drowning , do you hear ?
i am changed i go sell all my land .
exit thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gain knowledge should profane , if i would time expend with such a snipe .
but for my sport and profit .
i hate the moor and it is thought abroad , that my sheets he has done my office i know not be true , but i , for mere suspicion in that kind , will do as if for surety .
he holds me well , the better shall my purpose work on him .
cassio a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how , how ?
let see after some time , to abuse othello ear that he is too familiar with his wife .
he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected , framed to make women false .
the moor is of a free and open nature , that thinks men honest that but seem to be so , and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are .
i .
it is engender .
hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world light .
exit act ii scene i .
a in cyprus .
an open place near the quay .
enter montano and two gentlemen what from the cape can you discern at sea ?
nothing at all it is a highwrought flood , i can not , the heaven and the main , descry a sail .
methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land , a fuller blast shook our battlements if it hath ruffian so upon the sea , what ribs of oak , when mountains melt on them , can hold the mortise ?
what shall we hear of this ?
a segregation of the turkish fleet for do but stand upon the foaming shore , the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , the surge , with high and monstrous mane , seems to cast water on the burning bear , and quench the guards of the pole i never did like molestation view on the enchafed flood .
if that the turkish fleet be not enshelter and embay , they are drown it is impossible they bear it out .
enter a third gentleman news , lads !
our wars are done .
the desperate tempest hath so bang the turks , that their designment halts a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet .
how !
is this true ?
the ship is here put in , a veronesa , michael cassio , lieutenant to the warlike moor othello , is come on shore the moor himself at sea , and is in full commission here for cyprus .
i am glad o , is a worthy governor .
but this same cassio , though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss , yet he looks sadly , and prays the moor be safe , for they were parted with foul and violent tempest .
pray heavens he be , for i have served him , and the man commands like a full soldier .
let to the seaside , ho !
as well to see the vessel that come in as to throw out our eyes for brave othello , even till we make the main and the aerial blue an indistinct regard .
come , let do so for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance .
enter cassio thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle , that so approve the moor !
o , let the heavens give him defence against the elements , for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea .
is he well shipp ?
his bark is stoutly timber , his pilot of very expert and approved allowance , therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , stand in bold cure .
a cry within ' a sail , a sail , a sail ! '
enter a fourth gentleman what noise ?
the town is empty , on the brow o ' the sea stand ranks of people , and they cry ' a sail ! '
my hopes do shape him for the governor .
guns heard they do discharge their shot of courtesy our friends at least .
i pray you , sir , go forth , and give us truth who is that is arrived .
i shall .
exit but , good lieutenant , is your general wived ?
most fortunately he hath achieved a maid that paragons description and wild fame , one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens , and in the essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener .
second gentleman how now !
who has put in ?
is one iago , ancient to the general .
has had most favourable and happy speed tempests themselves , high seas , and howling winds , the gutter rocks and congregated sands traitors ensteep to clog the guiltless keel , as having sense of beauty , do omit their mortal natures , letting go safely by the divine desdemona .
what is she ?
she that i spake of , our great captain captain , left in the conduct of the bold iago , whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a speed .
great jove , othello guard , and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath , that he may bless this bay with his tall ship , make love quick pants in desdemona arms , give renew fire to our extincted spirits and bring all cyprus comfort !
enter desdemona , emilia , iago , roderigo , and attendants o , behold , the riches of the ship is come on shore !
ye men of cyprus , let her have your knees .
hail to thee , lady !
and the grace of heaven , before , behind thee , and on every hand , enwheel thee round !
i thank you , valiant cassio .
what tidings can you tell me of my lord ?
he is not yet arrived nor know i aught but that he well and will be shortly here .
o , but i fear how lost you company ?
the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship but , hark !
a sail .
within ' a sail , a sail ! '
guns heard they give their greeting to the citadel , this likewise is a friend .
see for the news .
exit gentleman good ancient , you are welcome .
to emilia welcome , mistress .
let it not gall your patience , good iago , that i extend my manners , is my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy .
kissing her sir , would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me , you have enough .
alas , she has no speech .
in faith , too much , i find it still , when i have list to sleep marry , before your ladyship , i grant , she puts her tongue a little in her heart , and chides with thinking .
you have little cause to say so .
come on , come on , you are pictures out of doors , bells in your parlors , in your kitchens , saints m your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives ' in your beds .
o , fie upon thee , slanderer !
nay , it is true , or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work .
you shall not write my praise .
no , let me not .
what wouldst thou write of me , if thou shouldst praise me ?
o gentle lady , do not put me , for i am nothing , if not critical .
come on assay .
there one gone to the harbour ?
ay , madam .
i am not merry , but i do beguile the thing i am , by seeming otherwise .
come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
i am about it , but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize , it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours , and thus she is deliver .
if she be fair and wise , fairness and wit , the one for use , the other useth it .
well praised !
how if she be black and witty ?
if she be black , and thereto have a wit , she find a white that shall her blackness fit .
worse and worse .
how if fair and foolish ?
she never yet was foolish that was fair , for even her folly help her to an heir .
these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i ' the alehouse .
what miserable praise hast thou for her that foul and foolish ?
there none so foul and foolish thereunto , but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do .
o heavy ignorance !
thou praisest the worst best .
but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that , in the authority of her merit , did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?
she that was ever fair and never proud , had tongue at will and yet was never loud , never lack gold and yet went never gay , fled from her wish and yet said i may , ' she that being anger , her revenge being nigh , bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly , she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod head for the salmon tail , she that could think and disclose her mind , see suitors following and not look behind , she was a wight , if ever such wight were , to do what ?
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
o most lame and impotent conclusion !
do not learn of him , emilia , though he be thy husband .
how say you , cassio ?
is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor ?
he speaks home , madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
aside he takes her by the palm ay , well said , whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio .
ay , smile upon her , do , i will gyve thee in thine own courtship .
you say true , is so , indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry , it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft , which now again you are most apt to play the sir in .
very good , well kissed !
an excellent courtesy !
is so , indeed .
yet again your fingers to your lips ?
would they were for your sake !
trumpet within the moor !
i know his trumpet .
is truly so .
let meet him and receive him .
lo , where he comes !
enter othello and attendants o my fair warrior !
my dear othello !
it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me .
o my soul joy !
if after every tempest come such calms , may the winds blow till they have waken death !
and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas and duck again as low as hell from heaven !
if it were now to die , now to be most happy , for , i fear , my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate .
the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase , even as our days do grow !
amen to that , sweet powers !
i can not speak enough of this content , it stops me here , it is too much of joy and this , and this , the greatest discords be kissing her that our hearts shall make !
aside o , you are well tuned now !
but i set down the pegs that make this music , as honest as i am .
come , let us to the castle .
news , friends , our wars are done , the turks are drown .
how does my old acquaintance of this isle ?
honey , you shall be well desired in cyprus , i have found great love amongst them .
o my sweet , i prattle out of fashion , and i dote in mine own comforts .
i prithee , good iago , go to the bay and disembark my coffers bring thou the master to the citadel , he is a good one , and his worthiness does challenge much respect .
come , desdemona , once more , well met at cyprus .
exeunt othello , desdemona , and attendants do thou meet me presently at the harbour .
come hither .
if thou valiant , as , they say , base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me .
the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first , i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him .
with him !
why , is not possible .
lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed .
mark me with what violence she first loved the moor , but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating ?
let not thy discreet heart think it .
her eye must be fed , and what delight shall she have to look on the devil ?
when the blood is made dull with the act of sport , there should be , again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite , loveliness in favour , sympathy in years , manners and beauties , all which the moor is defective in now , for want of these required conveniences , her delicate tenderness will find itself abused , begin to heave the gorge , disrelish and abhor the moor , very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice .
now , sir , this granted , as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does ?
a knave very voluble , no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming , for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection ?
why , none , why , none a slipper and subtle knave , a finder of occasions , that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages , though true advantage never present itself , a devilish knave .
besides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave , and the woman hath found him already .
i can not believe that in her , she full of most blessed condition .
blessed !
the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed , she would never have loved the moor .
blessed pudding !
didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand ?
didst not mark that ?
yes , that i did , but that was but courtesy .
lechery , by this hand , an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts .
they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .
villanous thoughts , roderigo !
when these mutualities so marshal the way , hard at hand comes the master and main exercise , the incorporate conclusion , pish !
but , sir , be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice .
watch you , for the command , i upon you .
cassio knows you not .
i not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favourably minister .
well .
sir , he is rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you provoke him , that he may , for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio .
so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them , and the impediment most profitably removed , without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity .
i will do this , if i can bring it to any opportunity .
i warrant thee .
meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore .
farewell .
adieu .
exit that cassio loves her , i do well believe it , that she loves him , is apt and of great credit the moor , howbeit that i endure him not , is of a constant , loving , noble nature , and i dare think he prove to desdemona a most dear husband .
now , i do love her too , not out of absolute lust , though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin , but partly led to diet my revenge , for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leap into my seat , the thought whereof doth , like a poisonous mineral , gnaw my inwards , and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am even with him , wife for wife , or failing so , yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment can not cure .
which thing to do , if this poor trash of venice , whom i trash for his quick hunting , stand the putting on , i have our michael cassio on the hip , abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my too make the moor thank me , love me and reward me .
for making him egregiously an ass and practising upon his peace and quiet even to madness .
is here , but yet confused knavery plain face is never seen tin used .
exit scene ii .
a street .
enter a herald with a proclamation , people following it is othello pleasure , our noble and valiant general , that , upon certain tidings now arrived , importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet , every man put himself into triumph , some to dance , some to make bonfires , each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for , besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .
so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .
all offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven .
heaven bless the isle of cyprus and our noble general othello !
exeunt scene iii .
a hall in the castle .
enter othello , desdemona , cassio , and attendants good michael , look you to the guard let teach ourselves that honourable stop , not to outsport discretion .
iago hath direction what to do , but , notwithstanding , with my personal eye will i look .
iago is most honest .
michael , good night with your earliest let me have speech with you .
to desdemona come , my dear love , the purchase made , the fruits are to ensue , that profit yet to come me and you .
good night .
exeunt othello , desdemona , and attendants enter iago welcome , iago , we must to the watch .
not this hour , lieutenant , is not yet ten o ' the clock .
our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona , who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her , and she is sport for jove .
she a most exquisite lady .
and , i warrant her , fun of game .
indeed , she a most fresh and delicate creature .
what an eye she has !
methinks it sounds a parley of provocation .
an inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest .
and when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
she is indeed perfection .
well , happiness to their sheets !
come , lieutenant , i have a stoup of wine , and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello .
not , good iago i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .
o , they are our friends , but one cup i drink for you .
i have drunk but one cup , and that was craftily qualified too , and , behold , what innovation it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity , and dare not task my weakness with any more .
what , man !
is a night of revels the gallants desire it .
where are they ?
here at the door , i pray you , call them in .
i , but it dislikes me .
exit if i can fasten but one cup upon him , with that which he hath drunk already , he be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress ' dog .
now , my sick fool roderigo , whom love hath turn almost the wrong side out , to desdemona hath caroused potations , and he to watch three lads of cyprus , noble swelling spirits , that hold their honours in a wary distance , the very elements of this warlike isle , have i fluster with flowing cups , and they watch too .
now , this flock of drunkards , am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the but here they come if consequence do but approve my dream , my boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .
cassio , with him montano and gentlemen , servants following with wine god , they have given me a rouse already .
good faith , a little one , not past a pint , as i am a soldier .
some wine , ho !
sings and let me the canakin clink , clink , and let me the canakin clink a soldier a man , a life but a span , why , then , let a soldier drink .
some wine , boys !
god , an excellent song .
i learned it in england , where , indeed , they are most potent in potting your dane , your german , and your hollander drink , ho ! are nothing to your english .
is your englishman so expert in his drinking ?
why , he drinks you , with facility , your dane dead drunk , he sweats not to overthrow your almain , he gives your hollander a vomit , ere the next pottle can be filled .
to the health of our general !
i am for it , lieutenant , and i do you justice .
o sweet england !
king stephen was a worthy peer , his breeches cost him but a crown , he held them sixpence all too dear , with that he call the tailor lown .
he was a wight of high renown , and thou art but of low degree is pride that pulls the country down , then take thine auld cloak about thee .
some wine , ho !
why , this is a more exquisite song than the other .
will you again ?
no , for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things .
well , god above all , and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved .
it true , good lieutenant .
for mine own part , no offence to the general , nor any man of quality , i hope to be saved .
and so do i too , lieutenant .
ay , but , by your leave , not before me , the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient .
let have no more of this , let to our forgive us our sins ! gentlemen , let look to our business .
do not think , gentlemen .
i am drunk this is my ancient , this is my right hand , and this is my left i am not drunk now , i can stand well enough , and speak well enough .
excellent well .
why , very well then , you must not think then that i am drunk .
exit to the platform , masters , come , let set the watch .
you see this fellow that is gone before , he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice , is to his virtue a just equinox , the one as long as the other is pity of him .
i fear the trust othello puts him in .
on some odd time of his infirmity , will shake this island .
but is he often thus ?
is evermore the prologue to his sleep he watch the horologe a double set , if drink rock not his cradle .
it were well the general were put in mind of it .
perhaps he sees it not , or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio , and looks not on his evils is not this true ?
enter roderigo aside to him how now , roderigo !
i pray you , after the lieutenant , go .
exit roderigo and is great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor .
not i , for this fair island i do love cassio well , and would do much to cure him of this evil but , hark !
what noise ?
cry within !
help ! '
cassio , driving in roderigo you rogue !
you rascal !
what the matter , lieutenant ?
a knave teach me my duty !
i beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .
beat me !
dost thou prate , rogue ?
striking roderigo nay , good lieutenant , staying him i pray you , sir , hold your hand .
let me go , sir , or i knock you the mazzard .
come , come , you drunk .
drunk !
they fight aside to roderigo away , i say , go out , and cry a mutiny .
exit roderigo nay , good lieutenant , alas , gentlemen , help , ho ! lieutenant , sir , montano , sir , help , masters ! here a goodly watch indeed !
bell rings who that which rings the bell ? diablo , ho !
the town will rise god will , lieutenant , hold !
you will be shamed for ever .
othello and attendants what is the matter here ?
, i bleed still , i am hurt to the death .
faints hold , for your lives !
hold , ho !
lieutenant , sir montano , gentlemen , have you forgot all sense of place and duty ?
hold !
the general speaks to you , hold , hold , for shame !
why , how now , ho !
from whence ariseth this ?
are we turn turks , and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites ?
for christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light , he dies upon his motion .
silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety .
what is the matter , masters ?
honest iago , that dead with grieving , speak , who began this ?
on thy love , i charge thee .
i do not know friends all but now , even now , in quarter , and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed , and then , but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out , and tilting one at other breast , in opposition bloody .
i can not speak any beginning to this peevish odds , and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it !
how comes it , michael , you are thus forgot ?
i pray you , pardon me , i can not speak .
worthy montano , you were wont be civil , the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted , and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure what the matter , that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a ?
give me answer to it .
worthy othello , i am hurt to danger your officer , iago , can inform you , while i spare speech , which something now offends me , of all that i do know nor know i aught by me that said or done amiss this night , unless be sometimes a vice , and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us .
now , by heaven , my blood begins my safer guides to rule , and passion , having my best judgment collied , assays to lead the way if i once stir , or do but lift this arm , the best of you shall sink in my rebuke .
give me to know how this foul rout began , who set it on , and he that is approved in this offence , though he had twinn with me , both at a birth , shall lose me .
what !
in a town of war , yet wild , the people hearts brimful of fear , to manage private and domestic quarrel , in night , and on the court and guard of safety !
is monstrous .
iago , who bega ?
if partially affined , or leagued in office , thou dost deliver more or less than truth , thou art no soldier .
touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio , yet , i persuade myself , to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him .
thus it is , general .
montano and myself being in speech , there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword , to execute upon him .
sir , this gentleman steps in to cassio , and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue , lest by his clamour as it so fell out the town might fall in fright he , swift of foot , outran my purpose , and i return the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords , and cassio high in oath , which till i might say before .
when i came back for this was brief i found them close together , at blow and thrust , even as again they were when you yourself did part them .
more of this matter can not i report but men are men , the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him , as men in rage strike those that wish them best , yet surely cassio , i believe , received from him that fled some strange indignity , which patience could not pass .
i know , iago , thy honesty and love doth mince this matter , making it light to cassio .
cassio , i love thee but never more be officer of mine .
desdemona , attended look , if my gentle love be not raised up !
i make thee an example .
what the matter ?
all well now , sweeting , come away to bed .
sir , for your hurts , myself will be your surgeon lead him off .
to montano , who is led off iago , look with care about the town , and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted .
come , desdemona is the soldiers ' life to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife .
exeunt all but iago and cassio what , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
ay , past all surgery .
marry , heaven forbid !
reputation , reputation , reputation !
o , i have lost my reputation !
i have lost the immortal part of myself , and what remains is bestial .
my reputation , iago , my reputation !
as i am an honest man , i thought you had received some bodily wound , there is more sense in that than in reputation .
reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit , and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all , unless you repute yourself such a loser .
what , man !
there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood , a punishment more in policy than in malice , even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again , and he yours .
i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an officer .
drunk ?
and speak parrot ?
and squabble ?
swagger ?
swear ?
and discourse fustian with one own shadow ?
o thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !
what was he that you followed with your sword ?
what had he done to you ?
i know not .
possible ?
i remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly , a quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
o god , that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains !
that we should , with joy , pleasance revel and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
why , but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered ?
it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath , one unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself .
come , you are too severe a moraler as the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , i could heartily wish this had not befallen , but , since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
i will ask him for my place again , he shall tell me i am a drunkard !
had i as many mouths as hydra , such an answer would stop them all .
to be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !
o strange !
every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .
come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used exclaim no more against it .
and , good lieutenant , i think you think i love you .
i have well approved it , sir .
i drunk !
you or any man living may be drunk !
at a time , man .
i tell you what you shall do .
our general wife is now the general may say so in this respect , for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation , mark , and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her , importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
you advise me well .
i protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
i think it freely , and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here .
you are in the right .
good night , lieutenant , i must to the watch .
cassio good night , honest iago .
exit and what he then that says i play the villain ?
when this advice is free i give and honest , probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again ?
for is most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she framed as fruitful as the free elements .
and then for her to win the moor to renounce his baptism , all seals and symbols of redeemed sin , his soul is so enfetter to her love , that she may make , unmake , do what she list , even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function .
how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course , directly to his good ?
divinity of hell !
when devils will the blackest sins put on , they do suggest at first with heavenly shows , as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortunes and she for him pleads strongly to the moor , i pour this pestilence into his ear , that she repeals him for her body lust , and by how much she strives to do him good , she shall undo her credit with the moor .
so will i turn her virtue into pitch , and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all .
roderigo how now , roderigo !
i do follow here in the chase , not like a hound that hunts , but one that fills up the cry .
my money is almost spent , i have been exceedingly well cudgelled , and i think the issue will be , i shall have so much experience for my pains , and so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to venice .
how poor are they that have not patience !
what wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
thou we work by wit , and not by witchcraft , and wit depends on dilatory time .
not go well ?
cassio hath beaten thee .
and thou , by that small hurt , hast cashier cassio though other things grow fair against the sun , yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile .
by the mass , is morning , pleasure and action make the hours seem short .
retire thee , go where thou art billeted away , i say , thou shalt know more hereafter nay , get thee gone .
exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress , i set her on , myself the while to draw the moor apart , and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay , that the way dull not device by coldness and delay .
exit act iii scene i .
before the castle .
enter cassio and some musicians masters , play here , i will content your pains , something that brief , and bid morrow , general . '
music enter clown why masters , have your instruments been in naples , that they speak i ' the nose thus ?
how , sir , how !
are these , i pray you , ?
ay , marry , are they , sir .
o , thereby hangs a tail .
whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
marry .
sir , by many a that i know .
but , masters , here money for you and the general so likes your music , that he desires you , for love sake , to make no more noise with it .
well , sir , we will not .
if you have any music that may not be heard , again but , as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care .
we have none such , sir .
then put up your pipes in your bag , for i away go , vanish into air , away !
exeunt musicians dost thou hear , my honest friend ?
no , i hear not your honest friend , i hear you .
prithee , keep up thy quillets .
there a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the general wife be stirring , tell her there one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech wilt thou do this ?
she is stirring , sir if she will stir hither , i shall seem to notify unto her .
do , good my friend .
exit clown enter iago in happy time , iago .
you have not been , then ?
why , no , the day had broke before we parted .
i have made bold , iago , to send in to your wife my suit to her is , that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access .
i send her to you presently , and i devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way , that your converse and business may be more free .
i humbly thank you .
exit iago i never knew a florentine more kind and honest .
enter emilia good morrow , good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasure , but all will sure be well .
the general and his wife are talking of it , and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies , that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus , and great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you , but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again .
yet , i beseech you , if you think fit , or that it may be done , give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone .
pray you , come in , i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely .
i am much bound to you .
exeunt scene ii .
a room in the castle .
enter othello , iago , and gentlemen these letters give , iago , to the pilot , and by him do my duties to the senate that done , i will be walking on the works , repair there to me .
well , my good lord , i .

we wait upon your lordship .
exeunt scene iii .
the garden of the castle .
enter desdemona , cassio , and emilia be thou assured , good cassio , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf .
good madam , do i warrant it grieves my husband , as if the case were his .
o , that an honest fellow .
do not doubt , cassio , but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were .
bounteous madam , whatever shall become of michael cassio , he never any thing but your true servant .
i , i thank you .
you do love my lord you have known him long , and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no further off than in a polite distance .
ay , but , lady , that policy may either last so long , or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , or breed itself so out of circumstance , that , i being absent and my place supplied , my general will forget my love and service .
do not doubt that , before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee , if i do vow a friendship , i perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest , i watch him tame and talk him out of patience , his bed shall seem a school , his board a shrift , i intermingle every thing he does with cassio suit therefore be merry , cassio , for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away .
madam , here comes my lord .
madam , i take my leave .
why , stay , and hear me speak .
madam , not now i am very ill at ease , unfit for mine own purposes .
well , do your discretion .
exit cassio enter othello and iago ha !
i like not that .
what dost thou say ?
nothing , my lord or if i know not what .
was not that cassio parted from my wife ?
cassio , my lord !
no , sure , i can not think it , that he would steal away so , seeing you coming .
i do believe was he .
how now , my lord !
i have been talking with a suitor here , a man that languishes in your displeasure .
who you mean ?
why , your lieutenant , cassio .
good my lord , if i have any grace or power to move you , his present reconciliation take , for if he be not one that truly loves you , that errs in ignorance and not in cunning , i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee , call him back .
went he hence now ?
ay , sooth , so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me , to suffer with him .
good love , call him back .
not now , sweet desdemona , some other time .
but be shortly ?
the sooner , sweet , for you .
be at supper ?
no , not .
dinner , then ?
i shall not dine at home , i meet the captains at the citadel .
why , then , night , or tuesday morn , on tuesday noon , or night , on wednesday morn i prithee , name the time , but let it not exceed three days in faith , he penitent , and yet his trespass , in our common reason save that , they say , the wars must make examples out of their best is not almost a fault to incur a private cheque .
when shall he come ?
tell me , othello i wonder in my soul , what you would ask me , that i should deny , or stand so mammering on .
what !
michael cassio , that came with you , and so many a time , when i have spoke of you dispraisingly , hath your part , to have so much to do to bring him in !
trust me , i could do much , prithee , no more let him come when he will , i will deny thee nothing .
why , this is not a boon , is as i should entreat you wear your gloves , or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm , or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay , when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed , it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted .
i will deny thee nothing whereon , i do beseech thee , grant me this , to leave me but a little to myself .
shall i deny you ?
no farewell , my lord .
farewell , my desdemona i come to thee straight .
emilia , come .
be as your fancies teach you , you be , i am obedient .
exeunt desdemona and emilia excellent wretch !
perdition catch my soul , but i do love thee !
and when i love thee not , chaos is come again .
my noble lord what dost thou say , iago ?
did michael cassio , when you woo my lady , know of your love ?
he did , from first to last why dost thou ask ?
but for a satisfaction of my thought , no further harm .
why of thy thought , iago ?
i did not think he had been acquainted with her .
o , yes , and went between us very oft .
indeed !
indeed !
ay , indeed thou aught in that ?
is he not honest ?
honest , my lord !
honest !
ay , honest .
my lord , for aught i know .
what dost thou think ?
think , my lord !
think , my lord !
by heaven , he echoes me , as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown .
thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now , thou likedst not that , when cassio left my wife what didst not like ?
and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing , thou criedst ! '
and didst contract and purse thy brow together , as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me , show me thy thought .
my lord , you know i love you .
i think thou dost , and , for i know full of love and honesty , and thy words before thou givest them breath , therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom , but in a man that just they are close delations , working from the heart that passion can not rule .
for michael cassio , i dare be sworn i think that he is honest .
i think so too .
men should be what they seem , or those that be not , would they might seem none !
certain , men should be what they seem .
why , then , i think cassio an honest man .
nay , yet there more in this i prithee , speak to me as to thy thinkings , as thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words .
good my lord , pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty , i am not bound to that all slaves are free to .
utter my thoughts ?
why , say they are vile and false , as where that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not ?
who has a breast so pure , but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and and in session sit with meditations lawful ?
thou dost conspire against thy friend , iago , if thou but him wrong and makest his ear a stranger to thy thoughts .
i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess , as , i confess , it is my nature plague to spy into abuses , and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet , from one that so imperfectly conceits , would take no notice , nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance .
it were not for your quiet nor your good , nor for my manhood , honesty , or wisdom , to let you know my thoughts .
what dost thou mean ?
good name in man and woman , dear my lord , is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash , is something , nothing , was mine , is his , and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed .
by heaven , i know thy thoughts .
you can not , if my heart were in your hand , nor shall not , whilst is in my custody .
ha !
o , beware , my lord , of jealousy , it is the monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on , that cuckold lives in bliss who , certain of his fate , loves not his wronger , but , o , what damned minutes tells he who dotes , yet doubts , suspects , yet strongly loves !
o misery !
poor and content is rich and rich enough , but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor .
good heaven , the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy !
why , why is this ?
thou make a lie of jealousy , to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions ?
no , to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat , when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises , matching thy inference .
is not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , is free of speech , sings , plays and dances well , where virtue is , these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt , for she had eyes , and chose me .
no , iago , i see before i doubt , when i doubt , prove , and on the proof , there is no more but this , away at once with love or jealousy !
i am glad of it , for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore , as i am bound , receive it from me .
i speak not yet of proof .
look to your wife , observe her well with cassio , wear your eye thus , not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature , out of , be abused , look i know our country disposition well , in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands , their best conscience is not to undone , but unknown .
dost thou say so ?
she did deceive her father , marrying you , and when she seem to shake and fear your looks , she loved them most .
and so she did .
why , go to then , she that , so young , could give out such a seeming , to seal her father eyes up close as he thought was witchcraft but i am much to blame , i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you .
i am bound to thee for ever .
i see this hath a little dash your spirits .
not a jot , not a jot .
i ' faith , i fear it has .
i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love .
but i do see you moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion .
i will not .
should you do so , my lord , my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at .
cassio my worthy friend my lord , i see you moved .
no , not much moved i do not think but desdemona honest .
long live she so !
and long live you to think so !
and yet , how nature erring from itself , ay , there the point as to be bold with you not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime , complexion , and degree , whereto we see in all things nature tends foh !
one may smell in such a will most rank , foul disproportion thoughts unnatural .
but pardon me , i do not in position distinctly speak of her , though i may fear her will , recoiling to her better judgment , may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent .
farewell , farewell if more thou dost perceive , let me know more , set on thy wife to observe leave me , iago going my lord , i take my leave .
why did i marry ?
this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more , much more , than he unfolds .
returning my lord , i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further , leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place , for sure , he fills it up with great ability , yet , if you please to hold him off awhile , you shall by that perceive him and his means note , if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity , much will be seen in that .
in the mean time , let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free , i do beseech your honour .
fear not my government .
i once more take my leave .
exit this fellow of exceeding honesty , and knows all qualities , with a learned spirit , of human dealings .
if i do prove her haggard , though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , whistle her off and let her down the wind , to pray at fortune .
haply , for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have , or for i am declined into the vale of years , yet that not much she gone .
i am abused , and my relief must be to loathe her .
o curse of marriage , that we can call these delicate creatures ours , and not their appetites !
i had rather be a toad , and live upon the vapour of a dungeon , than keep a corner in the thing i love for others ' uses .
yet , is the plague of great ones , prerogatived are they less than the base , is destiny unshunnable , like death even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken .
desdemona comes desdemona and emilia if she be false , o , then heaven mocks itself !
i not .
how now , my dear othello !
your dinner , and the generous islanders by you invited , do attend your presence .
i am to blame .
why do you speak so faintly ?
are you not well ?
i have a pain upon my forehead here .
, that with watching , away again let me but bind it hard , within this hour it will be well .
your napkin is too little he puts the handkerchief from him , and it drops let it alone .
come , i go in with you .
i am very sorry that you are not well .
exeunt othello and desdemona i am glad i have found this napkin this was her first remembrance from the moor my wayward husband hath a hundred times woo me to steal it , but she so loves the token , for he conjured her she should ever keep it , that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to .
i have the work out , and iago what he will do with it heaven knows , not i , i nothing but to please his fantasy .
iago how now !
what do you here alone ?
do not you chide , i have a thing for you .
a thing for me ?
it is a common thing ha !
to have a foolish wife .
o , is that all ?
what will you give me now for the same handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
why , that the moor first gave to desdemona , that which so often you did bid me steal .
hast it from her ?
no , , she let it drop by negligence .
and , to the advantage , i , being here , up .
look , here it is .
a good wench , give it me .
what will you do with , that you have been so earnest to have me filch it ?
snatching it why , what that to you ?
if it be not for some purpose of import , me again poor lady , she run mad when she shall lack it .
be not acknown on , i have use for it .
go , leave me .
exit emilia i will in cassio lodging lose this napkin , and let him find it .
trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something .
the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are , in their natures , poisons .
which at the first are scarce found to distaste , but with a little act upon the blood .
burn like the mines of sulphur .
i did say so look , where he comes !
othello not poppy , nor mandragora , nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday .
ha !
ha !
false to me ?
why , how now , general !
no more of that .
avaunt !
be gone !
thou hast set me on the rack i swear is better to be much abused than but to a little .
how now , my lord !
what sense had i of her hours of lust ?
i not , thought it not , it harm not me i slept the next night well , was free and merry , i found not cassio kisses on her lips he that is robb , not wanting what is , let him not , and he not robb at all .
i am sorry to hear this .
i had been happy , if the general camp , pioners and all , had tasted her sweet body , so i had nothing known .
o , now , for ever farewell the tranquil mind !
farewell content !
farewell the plumed troop , and the big wars , that make ambition virtue !
o , farewell !
farewell the neighing steed , and the shrill trump , the drum , the fife , the royal banner , and all quality , pride , pomp and circumstance of glorious war !
and , o you mortal engines , whose rude throats the immortal jove dead clamours counterfeit , farewell !
othello occupation gone !
possible , my lord ?
villain , be sure thou prove my love a whore , be sure of it , give me the ocular proof or by the worth of man eternal soul , thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath !
come to this ?
make me to , or , at the least , so prove it , that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life !
my noble lord , if thou dost slander her and torture me , never pray more , abandon all remorse , on horror head horrors accumulate , do deeds to make heaven weep , all earth amazed , for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that .
o grace !
o heaven forgive me !
are you a man ?
have you a soul or sense ?
god be wi ' you , take mine office .
o wretched fool .
that livest to make thine honesty a vice !
o monstrous world !
take note , take note , o world , to be direct and honest is not safe .
i thank you for this profit , and from hence i love no friend , sith love breeds such offence .
nay , stay thou shouldst be honest .
i should be wise , for honesty a fool and loses that it works for .
by the world , i think my wife be honest and think she is not , i think that thou art just and think thou art not .
i have some proof .
her name , that was as fresh as dian visage , is now begrimed and black as mine own face .
if there be cords , or knives , poison , or fire , or suffocating streams , i not endure it .
would i were satisfied !
i see , sir , you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you .
you would be satisfied ?
would !
nay , i will .
and may but , how ?
how satisfied , my lord ?
would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on behold her topp ?
death and damnation !
o !
it were a tedious difficulty , i think , to bring them to that prospect damn them then , if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own !
what then ?
how then ?
what shall i say ?
where satisfaction ?
it is impossible you should see this , were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , as salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk .
but yet , i say , if imputation and strong circumstances , which lead directly to the door of truth , will give you satisfaction , you may .
give me a living reason she disloyal .
i do not like the office but , sith i am enter in this cause so far , prick by foolish honesty and love , i will go on .
i lay with cassio lately , and , being troubled with a raging tooth , i could not sleep .
there are a kind of men so loose of soul , that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say desdemona , let us be wary , let us hide our loves , ' and then , sir , would he gripe and wring my hand , cry ' o sweet creature ! '
and then kiss me hard , as if he pluck up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg over my thigh , and sigh , and kiss , and then cried fate that gave thee to the moor ! '
o monstrous !
monstrous !
nay , this was but his dream .
but this denoted a foregone conclusion is a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream .
and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly .
i tear her all to pieces .
nay , but be wise yet we see nothing done , she may be honest yet .
tell me but this , have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife hand ?
i gave her such a one , was my first gift .
i know not that , but such a handkerchief i am sure it was your wife did i see cassio wipe his beard with .
if it be that if it be that , or any that was hers , it speaks against her with the other proofs .
o , that the slave had forty thousand lives !
one is too poor , too weak for my revenge .
now do i see is true .
look here , iago , all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven .
is gone .
arise , black vengeance , from thy hollow cell !
yield up , o love , thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate !
swell , bosom , with thy fraught , for is of aspics ' tongues !
yet be content .
o , blood , blood , blood !
patience , i say , your mind perhaps may change .
never , iago like to the pontic sea , whose icy current and compulsive course feels retiring ebb , but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont , even so my bloody thoughts , with violent pace , shall look back , ebb to humble love , till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up .
now , by yond marble heaven , kneels in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words .
do not rise yet .
kneels witness , you lights above , you elements that clip us round about , witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit , hands , heart , to wrong othello service !
let him command , and to obey shall be in me remorse , what bloody business ever .
they rise i greet thy love , not with vain thanks , but with acceptance bounteous , and will upon the instant put thee within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio not alive .
my friend is dead , is done at your request but let her live .
damn her , lewd minx !
o , damn her !
come , go with me apart , i will withdraw , to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil .
now art thou my lieutenant .
i am your own for ever .
exeunt scene iv .
before the castle .
enter desdemona , emilia , and clown do you know , sirrah , where lieutenant cassio lies ?
i dare not say he lies any where .
why , man ?
he a soldier , and for one to say a soldier lies , is stabbing .
go to where lodges he ?
to tell you where he lodges , is to tell you where i lie .
can any thing be made of this ?
i know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .
can you inquire him out , and be edified by report ?
i will catechise the world for him , that is , make questions , and by them answer .
seek him , bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
to do this is within the compass of man wit and therefore i will attempt the doing it .
exit where should i lose that handkerchief , emilia ?
i know not , madam .
believe me , i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and , but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are , it were enough to put him to ill thinking .
is he not jealous ?
who , he ?
i think the sun where he was born drew all such humours from him .
look , where he comes .
i will not leave him now till cassio be call to him .
enter othello how with you , my lord well , my good lady .
aside o , hardness to dissemble ! how do you , desdemona ?
well , my good lord .
give me your hand this hand is moist , my lady .
it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow .
this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot , hot , and moist this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty , fasting and prayer , much castigation , exercise devout , for here a young and sweating devil here , that commonly rebels .
is a good hand , a frank one .
you may , indeed , say so , for was that hand that gave away my heart .
a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands , but our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
i can not speak of this .
come now , your promise .
what promise , chuck ?
i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you .
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me , lend me thy handkerchief .
here , my lord .
that which i gave you .
i have it not about me .
not ?
no , indeed , my lord .
that is a fault .
that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give , she was a charmer , and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her , while she kept it , make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love , but if she lost it or made gift of it , my father eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she , dying , gave it me , and bid me , when my fate would have me wive , to give it her .
i did so and take heed o , make it a darling like your precious eye , to or away were such perdition as nothing else could match .
possible ?
is true there magic in the web of it a sibyl , that had number in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses , in her prophetic fury sew the work , the worms were hallow that did breed the silk , and it was dyed in mummy which the skilful conserved of maidens ' hearts .
indeed !
true ?
most veritable , therefore look well .
then would to god that i had never see !
ha !
wherefore ?
why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
lost ?
gone ?
speak , is it out o ' the way ?
heaven bless us !
say you ?
it is not lost , but what an if it were ?
how !
i say , it is not lost .
, let me .
why , so i can , sir , but i will not now .
this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you , let cassio be received again .
fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives .
come , come , you never meet a more sufficient man .
the handkerchief !
i pray , talk me of cassio .
the handkerchief !
a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love , shared dangers with you , the handkerchief !
in sooth , you are to blame .
away !
exit is not this man jealous ?
i saw this before .
sure , there some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it .
is not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomachs , and we all but food , to eat us hungerly , and when they are full , they belch us .
look you , cassio and my husband !
enter cassio and iago there is no other way , is she must and , lo , the happiness !
go , and importune her .
how now , good cassio !
what the news with you ?
madam , my former suit i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist , and be a member of his love whom i with all the office of my heart entirely honour i would not be delay .
if my offence be of such mortal kind that nor my service past , nor present sorrows , nor purposed merit in futurity , can ransom me into his love again , but to know so must be my benefit , so shall i clothe me in a forced content , and shut myself up in some other course , to fortune alms .
alas , cassio !
my advocation is not now in tune , my lord is not my lord , nor should i know him , were he in favour as in humour alter .
so help me every spirit sanctified , as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech !
you must awhile be patient what i can do i will , and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you .
is my lord angry ?
he went hence but now , and certainly in strange unquietness .
can he be angry ?
i have seen the cannon , when it hath blown his ranks into the air , and , like the devil , from his very arm puff his own brother and can he be angry ?
something of moment then i will go meet him there matter i indeed , if he be angry .
i prithee , do so .
exit iago something , sure , of state , either from venice , or some unhatch practise made demonstrable here in cyprus to him , hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases men natures wrangle with inferior things , though great ones are their object .
is even so , for let our finger ache , and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain nay , we must think men are not gods , nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal .
beshrew me much , emilia , i was , unhandsome warrior as i am , arraigning his unkindness with my soul , but now i find i had suborn the witness , and he indicted falsely .
pray heaven it be , as you think , and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you .
alas the day !
i never gave him cause .
but jealous souls will not be answer so , they are not ever jealous for the cause , but jealous for they are jealous is a monster begot upon itself , born on itself .
heaven keep that monster from othello mind !
lady , amen .
i will go seek him .
cassio , walk hereabout if i do find him fit , i move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost .
i humbly thank your ladyship .
exeunt desdemona and emilia enter bianca save you , friend cassio !
what make you from home ?
how is it with you , my most fair bianca ?
i ' faith , sweet love , i was coming to your house .
and i was going to your lodging , cassio .
what , keep a week away ?
seven days and nights ?
eight score eight hours ?
and lovers ' absent hours , more tedious than the dial eight score times ?
o weary reckoning !
pardon me , bianca i have this while with leaden thoughts been press but i shall , in a more continuate time , strike off this score of absence .
sweet bianca , giving her desdemona handkerchief take me this work out .
o cassio , whence came this ?
this is some token from a newer friend to the felt absence now i feel a cause come to this ?
well , well .
go to , woman !
throw your vile guesses in the devil teeth , from whence you have them .
you are jealous now that this is from some mistress , some remembrance no , in good troth , bianca .
why , whose is it ?
i know not , sweet i found it in my chamber .
i like the work well ere it be demanded as like enough it will have it copied take it , and , and leave me for this time .
leave you !
wherefore ?
i do attend here on the general , and think it no addition , nor my wish , to have him see me woman .
why , i pray you ?
not that i love you not .
but that you do not love me .
i pray you , bring me on the way a little , and say if i shall see you soon at night .
is but a little way that i can bring you , for i attend here but i see you soon .
is very good , i must be circumstanced .
exeunt act iv scene cyprus .
before the castle .
enter othello and iago will you think so ?
think so , iago !
what , to kiss in private ?
an unauthorized kiss .
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
naked in bed , iago , and not mean harm !
it is hypocrisy against the devil they that mean virtuously , and yet do so , the devil their virtue tempts , and they tempt heaven .
so they do nothing , is a venial slip but if i give my wife a handkerchief , what then ?
why , then , is hers , my lord , and , being hers , she may , i think , on any man .
she is protectress of her honour too may she give that ?
her honour is an essence that not seen , they have it very oft that have it not but , for the handkerchief , by heaven , i would most gladly have forgot it .
thou , it comes my memory , as doth the raven the infected house , boding to all he had my handkerchief .
ay , what of that ?
that not so good now .
what , if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ?
or heard him say , as knaves be such abroad , who having , by their own importunate suit , or voluntary dotage of some mistress , convinced or supplied them , can not choose but they must blab hath he said any thing ?
he hath , my lord , but be you well assured , no more than he unswear .
what hath he said ?
, that he did i know not what he did .
what ?
what ?
lie with her ?
with her , on her , what you will .
lie with her !
lie on her !
we say lie on her , when they belie her .
lie with her !
that fulsome .
handkerchief confessions handkerchief ! to confess , and be hanged for his labour , first , to be hanged , and then to i tremble at it .
nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction .
it is not words that shake me thus .
pish !
noses , ears , and lips .
possible ? confess handkerchief ! o devil ! falls in a trance work on , my medicine , work !
thus credulous fools are caught , and many worthy and chaste dames even thus , all guiltless , meet reproach .
what , ho !
my lord !
my lord , i say !
othello !
enter cassio how now , cassio !
what the matter ?
my lord is into an epilepsy this is his second fit , he had one yesterday .
rub him about the temples .
no , forbear , the lethargy must have his quiet course if not , he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness .
look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while , he will recover straight when he is gone , i would on great occasion speak with you .
exit cassio how is it , general ?
have you not hurt your head ?
dost thou mock me ?
i mock you !
no , by heaven .
would you would bear your fortune like a man !
a horned man a monster and a beast .
there many a beast then in a populous city , and many a civil monster .
did he confess it ?
good sir , be a man , think every bearded fellow that but yoked may draw with you there millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better .
o , is the spite of hell , the fiend , to lip a wanton in a secure couch , and to suppose her chaste !
no , let me know , and knowing what i am , i know what she shall be .
o , thou art wise , is certain .
stand you awhile apart , confine yourself but in a patient list .
whilst you were here with your grief a passion most unsuiting such a man cassio came hither i shifted him away , and laid good upon your ecstasy , bade him anon return and here speak with me , the which he promised .
do but encave yourself , and mark the fleers , the gibes , and notable scorns , that dwell in every region of his face , for i will make him tell the tale anew , where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when he hath , and is again to cope your wife i say , but mark his gesture .
marry , patience , or i shall say you are all in all in spleen , and nothing of a man .
dost thou hear , iago ?
i will be found most cunning in my patience , but dost thou hear ? most bloody .
that not amiss , but yet keep time in all .
will you withdraw ?
othello retires now will i question cassio of bianca , a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio , as is the strumpet plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one he , when he hears of her , can not refrain from the excess of laughter .
here he comes cassio as he shall smile , othello shall go mad , and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio smiles , gestures and light behavior , quite in the wrong .
how do you now , lieutenant ?
the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me .
ply desdemona well , and you are sure o .
speaking lower now , if this suit lay in bianco power , how quickly should you speed !
alas , poor caitiff !
look , how he laughs already !
i never knew woman love man so .

as it were his gesture imports it .
so hangs , and lolls , and weeps upon me , so hales , and pulls me ha , ha , ha !

nay , you must forget that .
ay , let her rot , and perish , and be damned , for she shall not live no , my heart is turned to stone , i strike it , and it hurts my hand .

i am glad to see you mad .
why , sweet othello , striking her devil !
i have not deserved this .
my lord , this would not be believed in venice , though i should swear i is very much make her amends , she weeps .
o devil , devil !
if that the earth could teem with woman tears , each drop she falls would prove a crocodile .
out of my sight !
i will not stay to offend you .
going truly , an obedient lady i do beseech your lordship , call her back .
mistress !
my lord ?
what would you with her , sir ?

sir , i obey the mandate , and will return to venice .
hence , avaunt !
exit desdemona cassio shall have my place .
and , sir , tonight , i do entreat that we may sup together you are welcome , sir , to goats and monkeys !
exit is this the noble moor whom our full senate call all in all sufficient ?
is this the nature whom passion could not shake ?
whose solid virtue the shot of accident , nor dart of chance , could neither graze nor pierce ?
he is much changed .
are his wits safe ?
is he not light of brain ?
he that he is i may not breathe my censure what he might be if what he might he is not , i would to heaven he were !
what , strike his wife !
, that was not so well , yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst !
is it his use ?
or did the letters work upon his blood , and this fault ?
alas , alas !
it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known .
you shall observe him , and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech do but go after , and mark how he continues .
i am sorry that i am deceived in him .
exeunt scene ii .
a room in the castle .
enter othello and emilia you have seen nothing then ?
nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
yes , you have seen cassio and she together .
but then i saw no harm , and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them .
what , did they never whisper ?
never , my lord .
nor send you out o ' the way ?
never .
to fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?
never , my lord .
that strange .
i durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , lay down my soul at stake if you think other , remove your thought , it doth abuse your bosom .
if any wretch have put this in your head , let heaven requite it with the serpent curse !
for , if she be not honest , chaste , and true , there no man happy , the purest of their wives is foul as slander .
bid her come hither go .
exit emilia she says enough , yet she a simple bawd that can not say as much .
this is a subtle whore , a closet lock and key of villanous secrets and yet she kneel and pray , i have seen her .
enter desdemona with emilia my lord , what is your will ?
pray , chuck , come hither .
what is your pleasure ?
let me see your eyes , look in my face .
what horrible fancy this ?
to emilia some of your function , mistress , leave procreants alone and shut the door , cough , or cry , ' if any body come your mystery , your mystery nay , dispatch .
exit emilia upon my knees , what doth your speech import ?
i understand a fury in your words .
but not the words .
why , what art thou ?
your wife , my lord , your true and loyal wife .
come , swear it , damn thyself lest , being like one of heaven , the devils themselves should fear to seize thee therefore be double damn swear thou art honest .
heaven doth truly know it .
heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
to whom , my lord ?
with whom ?
how am i false ?
o desdemona !
away !
away !
away !
alas the heavy day !
why do you weep ?
am i the motive of these tears , my lord ?
if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back , lay not your blame on me if you have lost him , why , i have lost him too .
had it pleased heaven to try me with affliction , had they rain all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head .
steep me in poverty to the very lips , given to captivity me and my utmost hopes , i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but , alas , to make me a fixed figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at !
yet could i bear that too , well , very well but there , where i have garner up my heart , where either i must live , or bear no life , the fountain from the which my current runs , or else dries up , to be discarded thence !
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in !
turn thy complexion there , patience , thou young and cherubin , ay , there , look grim as hell !
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
o , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , that quicken even with blowing .
o thou weed , who art so lovely fair and so sweet that the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst been born !
alas , what ignorant sin have i committed ?
was this fair paper , this most goodly book , made to write ' upon ?
what committed !
committed !
o thou public commoner !
i should make very forges of my cheeks , that would to cinders burn up modesty , did i but speak thy deeds .
what committed !
heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks , the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hush within the hollow mine of earth , and will not hear it .
what committed !
impudent strumpet !
by heaven , you do me wrong .
are you not a strumpet ?
no , as i am a christian if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet , i am none .
what , not a whore ?
no , as i shall be saved .
possible ?
o , heaven forgive us !
i cry you mercy , then i took you for that cunning whore of venice that married with othello .
raising his voice you , mistress , that have the office opposite to saint peter , and keep the gate of hell !
emilia you , you , ay , you !
we have done our course , there money for your pains i pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel .
exit alas , what does this gentleman conceive ?
how do you , madam ?
how do you , my good lady ?
, half asleep .
good madam , what the matter with my lord ?
with who ?
why , with my lord , madam .
who is thy lord ?
he that is yours , sweet lady .
i have none do not talk to me , emilia , i can not weep , nor answer have i none , but what should go by water .
prithee , tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember , and call thy husband hither .
here a change indeed !
exit is meet i should be used so , very meet .
how have i been behaved , that he might stick the opinion on my least misuse ?
emilia with iago what is your pleasure , madam ?
how with you ?
i can not tell .
those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks he might have chid me so , for , in good faith , i am a child to chiding .
what the matter , lady ?
alas , iago , my lord hath so bewhored her .
thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her , as true hearts can not bear .
am i that name , iago ?
what name , fair lady ?
such as she says my lord did say i was .
he call her whore a beggar in his drink could not have laid such terms upon his callat .
why did he so ?
i do not know , i am sure i am none such .
do not weep , do not weep .
alas the day !
hath she forsook so many noble matches , her father and her country and her friends , to be call whore ?
would it not make one weep ?
it is my wretched fortune .
beshrew him !
how comes this trick upon him ?
nay , heaven doth know .
i will be hang , if some eternal villain , some busy and insinuating rogue , some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , have not devised this slander , i be hang else .
fie , there is no such man , it is impossible .
if any such there be , heaven pardon him !
a halter pardon him !
and hell gnaw his bones !
why should he call her whore ?
who keeps her company ?
what place ?
what time ?
what form ?
what likelihood ?
the moor abused by some most villanous knave , some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow .
o heaven , that such companions unfold , and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to the west !
speak within door .
o , fie upon them !
some such squire he was that turn your wit the seamy side without , and made you to suspect me with the moor .
you are a fool , go to .
o good iago , what shall i do to win my lord again ?
good friend , go to him , for , by this light of heaven , i know not how i lost him .
here i kneel if my will did trespass his love , either in discourse of thought or actual deed , or that mine eyes , mine ears , or any sense , delighted them in any other form , or that i do not yet , and ever did .
and ever will though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement love him dearly , comfort forswear me !
unkindness may do much , and his unkindness may defeat my life , but never taint my love .
i can not say ' it does abhor me now i speak the word , to do the act that might the addition earn not the world mass of vanity could make me .
i pray you , be content , is but his humour the business of the state does him offence , and he does chide with you .
if no other is but so , i warrant .
trumpets within hark , how these instruments summon to supper !
the messengers of venice stay the meat , go in , and weep not , all things shall be well .
exeunt desdemona and emilia enter roderigo how now , roderigo !
i do not find that thou dealest justly with me .
what in the contrary ?
every day thou daffest me with some device , iago , and rather , as it seems to me now , keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope .
i will indeed no longer endure it , nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered .
will you hear me , roderigo ?
, i have heard too much , for your words and performances are no kin together .
you charge me most unjustly .
with nought but truth .
i have wasted myself out of my means .
the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but i find none .
well , go to , very well .
very well !
go to !
i can not go to , man , nor is not very well nay , i think it is scurvy , and begin to find myself fobbed in it .
very well .
i tell you is not very well .
i will make myself known to desdemona if she will return me my jewels , i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation , if not , assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you .
you have said now .
ay , and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing .
why , now i see there mettle in thee , and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before .
give me thy hand , roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet , i protest , i have dealt most directly in thy affair .
it hath not appeared .
i grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment .
but , roderigo , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which i have greater reason to believe now than ever , i mean purpose , courage and valour , this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life .
well , what is it ?
is it within reason and compass ?
sir , there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello place .
is that true ?
why , then othello and desdemona return again to venice .
o , no , he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona , unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio .
how do you mean , removing of him ?
why , by making him uncapable of othello place , knocking out his brains .
and that you would have me to do ?
ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right .
he sups with a harlotry , and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable fortune .
if you will watch his going thence , which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one , you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us .
come , stand not amazed at it , but go along with me , i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him .
it is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste about it .
i will hear further reason for this .
and you shall be satisfied .
exeunt scene iii .
another room in the castle .
enter othello , lodovico , desdemona , emilia and attendants i do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
o , pardon me do me good to walk .
madam , good night , i humbly thank your ladyship .
your honour is most welcome .
will you walk , sir ?
o , desdemona , my lord ?
get you to bed on the instant , i will be returned forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done .
i will , my lord .
exeunt othello , lodovico , and attendants how goes it now ?
he looks gentler than he did .
he says he will return incontinent he hath commanded me to go to bed , and bade me to dismiss you .
dismiss me !
it was his bidding therefore , good emilia , .
give me my nightly wearing , and adieu we must not now displease him .
i would you had never seen him !
so would not i my love doth so approve him , that even his stubbornness , his cheques , his frowns prithee , unpin me , have grace and favour in them .
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
all one .
good faith , how foolish are our minds !
if i do die before thee prithee , shroud me in one of those same sheets .
come , come you talk .
my mother had a maid call barbara she was in love , and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her she had a song of , ' an old thing was , but it express her fortune , and she died singing it that song will not go from my mind , i have much to do , but to go hang my head all at one side , and sing it like poor barbara .
prithee , dispatch .
shall i go fetch your ?
no , unpin me here .
this lodovico is a proper man .
a very handsome man .
he speaks well .
i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip .
singing the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree , sing all a green willow her hand on her bosom , her head on her knee , sing willow , willow , willow the fresh streams ran by her , and murmur her moans , sing willow , willow , willow , her salt tears fell from her , and soften the stones , lay by these singing sing willow , willow , willow , prithee , hie thee , he come anon singing sing all a green willow must be my garland .
let nobody blame him , his scorn i approve , - nay , that not hark !
who that knocks ?
it the wind .
singing i call my love false love , but what said he then ?
sing willow , willow , willow if i court moe women , you couch with moe men !
so , get thee gone , good night ate eyes do itch , doth that bode weeping ?
is neither here nor there .
i have heard it said so .
o , these men , these men !
dost thou in conscience think , tell me , emilia , that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind ?
there be some such , no question .
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
why , would not you ?
no , by this heavenly light !
nor i neither by this heavenly light , i might as well i ' the dark .
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
the world a huge thing it is a great price .
for a small vice .
in troth , i think thou wouldst not .
in troth , i think i should , and when i had done .
marry , i would not do such a thing for a , nor for measures of lawn , nor for gowns , petticoats , nor caps , nor any petty exhibition , but for the whole world , why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ?
i should venture purgatory .
beshrew me , if i would do such a wrong for the whole world .
why the wrong is but a wrong i ' the world and having the world for your labour , tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
i do not think there is any such woman .
yes , a dozen , and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for .
but i do think it is their husbands ' faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties , and pour our treasures into foreign laps , or else break out in peevish jealousies , throwing restraint upon us , or say they strike us , or scant our former having in despite , why , we have galls , and though we have some grace , yet have we some revenge .
let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour , as husbands have .
what is it that they do when they change us for others ?
is it sport ?
i think it is and doth affection breed it ?
i think it doth frailty that thus errs ?
it is so too and have not we affections , desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ?
then let them use us well else let them know , the ills we do , their ills instruct us so .
good night , good night heaven me such uses send , not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !

exeunt scene ii .
a bedchamber in the castle desdemona in bed asleep , a light burning .
enter othello it is the cause , it is the cause , my soul , let me not name it to you , you chaste stars ! it is the cause .
yet i not shed her blood , nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow , and smooth as monumental alabaster .
yet she must die , else she betray more men .
put out the light , and then put out the light if i quench thee , thou flaming minister , i can again thy former light restore , should i repent me but once put out thy light , thou pattern of excelling nature , i know not where is that promethean heat that can thy light relume .
when i have pluck the rose , i can not give it vital growth again .
it must needs wither i smell it on the tree .
kissing her ah balmy breath , that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword !
one more , one more .
be thus when thou art dead , and i will kill thee , and love thee after .
one more , and this the last so sweet was so fatal .
i must weep , but they are cruel tears this sorrow heavenly , it strikes where it doth love .
she wakes .
who there ?
othello ?
ay .
desdemona .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
have you pray , desdemona ?
ay , my lord .
if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace , solicit for it straight .
alas , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
well , do it , and be brief , i will walk by i would not kill thy unprepared spirit , no , heaven forfend !
i would not kill thy soul .
talk you of killing ?
ay , i do .
then heaven have mercy on me !
amen , with all my heart !
if you say so , i hope you will not kill me .
hum !
and yet i fear you , for you are fatal then when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not , since guiltiness i know not , but yet i feel i fear .
think on thy sins .
they are loves i bear to you .
ay , and for that thou diest .
that death unnatural that kills for loving .
alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
some bloody passion shakes your very frame these are portents , but yet i hope , i hope , they do not point on me .
peace , and be still !
i will so .
what the matter ?
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee thou gavest to cassio .
no , by my life and soul !
send for the man , and ask him .
sweet soul , take heed , take heed of perjury , thou art on thy deathbed .
ay , but not yet to die .
yes , presently therefore confess thee freely of thy sin , for to deny each article with oath can not remove nor choke the strong conception that i do groan withal .
thou art to die .
then lord have mercy on me !
i say , amen .
and have you mercy too !
i never did offend you in my life , never loved cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as i might love i never gave him token .
by heaven , i saw my handkerchief in hand .
o perjured woman !
thou dost stone my heart , and makest me call what i intend to do a murder , which i thought a sacrifice i saw the handkerchief .
he found it then , i never gave it him send for him hither , let him confess a truth .
he hath confess .
what , my lord ?
that he hath used thee .
how ?
unlawfully ?
ay .
he will not say so .

o , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
down , strumpet !

nay , if you strive but half an hour !
being done , there is no pause .
but while i say one prayer !
it is too late .
he stifles her within my lord , my lord !
what , ho !
my lord , my lord !
what noise is this ?
not dead ?
not yet quite dead ?
i that am cruel am yet merciful , i would not have thee linger in thy pain so , so .

yes is emilia .
by and by .

what best to do ?
if she come in , she sure speak to my wife my wife !
my wife !

i have no wife .
o insupportable !
o heavy hour !
methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon , and that the affrighted globe should yawn at alteration .
within i do beseech you that i may speak with you , o , good my lord !
i had forgot thee o , come in , emilia , soft , by and by .
let me the curtains draw .
where art thou ?
unlocks the door enter emilia what the matter with thee now ?

help !
o lady , speak again !

a guiltless death i die .
o , who hath done this deed ?
nobody , i myself .
farewell commend me to my kind lord o , farewell !
dies why , how should she be murder ?
alas , who knows ?
you heard her say herself , it was not i .
she said so i must needs report the truth .
she , like a liar , gone to burning hell was i that kill her .
o , the more angel she , and you the blacker devil !
she turn to folly , and she was a whore .
thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
she was false as water .
thou art rash as fire , to say that she was false o , she was heavenly true !
cassio did top her , ask thy husband else .
o , i were damn beneath all depth in hell , but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity .
thy husband knew it all .
my husband !
thy husband .
that she was false to wedlock ?
ay , with cassio .
nay , had she been true , if heaven would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite , not have sold her for it .
my husband !
ay , was he that told me first an honest man he is , and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds .
my husband !
what needs this iteration , woman ?
i say thy husband .
o mistress , villany hath made mocks with love , my husband say that she was false !
he , woman , i say thy husband dost understand the word ?
my friend , thy husband , honest , honest iago .
if he say so , may his pernicious soul rot half a grain a day !
he lies to the heart she was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
ha !
do thy worst this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven than thou wast worthy her .
peace , you were best .
thou hast not half that power to do me harm as i have to be hurt .
o gull !
o dolt !
as ignorant as dirt !
thou hast done a deed i care not for thy sword , i make thee known , though i lost twenty help !
help , ho !
help !
the moor hath kill my mistress !
murder !
murder !
enter montano , gratiano , iago , and others what is the matter ?
how now , general !
o , are you come , iago ?
you have done well , that men must lay their murders on your neck .
what is the matter ?
disprove this villain , if thou a man he says thou him that his wife was false i know thou didst not , not such a villain speak , for my heart is full .
i told him what i thought , and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true .
but did you ever tell him she was false ?
i did .
you told a lie , an odious , damned lie , upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie .
she false with cassio ! did you say with cassio ?
with cassio , mistress .
go to , charm your tongue .
i will not charm my tongue , i am bound to speak my mistress here lies murder in her bed , o heavens forfend !
and your reports have set the murder on .
nay , stare not , masters it is true , indeed .
is a strange truth .
o monstrous act !
villany , villany , villany !
i think upo , i think i o villany ! i thought so then i kill myself for grief o villany , villany !
what , are you mad ?
i charge you , get you home .
good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak is proper i obey him , but not now .
perchance , iago , i will go home .
o !
o !

he falls on the bed nay , lay thee down and roar , for thou hast kill the sweetest innocent that did lift up eye .
rising o , she was foul !
i scarce did know you , uncle there lies your niece , whose breath , indeed , these hands have newly stopp i know this act shows horrible and grim .
poor desdemona !
i am glad thy father dead thy match was mortal to him , and pure grief shore his old thread in twain did he live now , this sight would make him do a desperate turn , yea , curse his better angel from his side , and fall to reprobation .
is pitiful , but yet iago knows that she with cassio hath the act of shame a thousand times committed , cassio confess it and she did gratify his amorous works with that recognizance and pledge of love which i first gave her , i saw it in his hand it was a handkerchief , an antique token my father gave my mother .
o heaven !
o heavenly powers !
come , hold your peace .
out , out i peace !
no , i will speak as liberal as the north let heaven and men and devils , let them all , all , all , cry shame against me , yet i speak .
be wise , and get you home .
i will not .
iago offers to stab emilia fie !
your sword upon a woman ?
o thou dull moor !
that handkerchief thou of i found by fortune and did give my husband , for often , with a solemn earnestness , more than indeed belong to such a trifle , he begg of me to steal it .
villanous whore !
she give it cassio !
no , alas !
i found it , and i did my husband .
filth , thou liest !
by heaven , i do not , i do not , gentlemen .
o murderous coxcomb !
what should such a fool do with so good a woman ?
are there no stones in heaven but what serve for the thunder ? precious villain !
he runs at iago iago , from behind , stabs emilia , and exit the woman falls , sure , he hath kill his wife .
ay , ay o , lay me by my mistress ' side .
he gone , but his wife kill .
is a notorious villain .
take you this weapon , which i have here recover from the moor come , guard the door without , let him not pass , but kill him rather .
i after that same villain , for is a damned slave .
exeunt montano and gratiano i am not valiant neither , but ever puny whipster gets my sword but why should honour outlive honesty ?
let it go all .
what did thy song bode , lady ?
hark , canst thou hear me ?
i will play the swan .
and die in music .
singing willow , willow , willow , moor , she was chaste , she loved thee , cruel moor , so come my soul to bliss , as i speak true , so speaking as i think , i die , i die .
dies i have another weapon in this chamber , it is a sword of spain , the temper o , here it is .
uncle , i must come forth .
within if thou attempt it , it will cost thee dear thou hast no weapon , and perforce must suffer .
look in upon me then and speak with me , or , naked as i am , i will assault thee .
gratiano what is the matter ?
behold , i have a weapon , a better never did itself sustain upon a soldier thigh i have seen the day , that , with this little arm and this good sword , i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop but , o vain boast !
who can control his fate ?
is not so now .
be not afraid , though you do see me weapon , here is my journey end , here is my butt , and very of my utmost sail .
do you go back dismay ?
is a lost fear , man but a rush against othello breast , and he retires .
where should othello go ?
now , how dost thou look now ?
o wench !
pale as thy smock !
when we shall meet at compt , this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven , and fiends will snatch at it .
cold , cold , my girl !
even like thy chastity .
o cursed slave !
whip me , ye devils , from the possession of this heavenly sight !
blow me about in winds !
roast me in sulphur !
wash me in gulfs of liquid fire !
o desdemona !
desdemona !
dead !
oh !
oh !
oh !
enter lodovico .
montano , cassio carried in a chair , and officers with iago , prisoner where is this rash and most unfortunate man ?
that he that was othello here i am .
where is that viper ?
bring the villain forth .
i look down towards his feet , but that a fable .
if that thou best a devil , i can not kill thee .
wounds iago wrench his sword from him .
i bleed , sir , but not kill .
i am not sorry neither have thee live , for , in my sense , is happiness to die .
o thou othello , thou wert once so good , in the practise of a damned slave , what shall be said to thee ?
why , any thing an honourable murderer , if you will , for nought i did in hate , but all in honour .
this wretch hath part confess his villany did you and he consent in cassio death ?
ay .
dear general , i never gave you cause .
i do believe it , and i ask your pardon .
will you , i pray , demand that why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
demand me nothing what you know , you know from this time forth i never will speak word .
what , not to pray ?
torments will ope your lips .
well , thou dost best .
sir , you shall understand what hath , which , as i think , you know not .
here is a letter found in the pocket of the slain roderigo , and here another the one of them imports the death of cassio to be undertook by roderigo .
o villain !
most heathenish and most gross !
now here another discontented paper , found in his pocket too , and this , it seems , roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain , but that belike iago in the interim came in and satisfied him .
o the pernicious caitiff !
how came you , cassio , by that handkerchief that was my wife ?
i found it in my chamber and he himself confess but even now that there he dropp it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire .
o fool !
fool !
fool !
there is besides in roderigo letter , how he upbraids iago , that he made him brave me upon the watch , whereon it came that i was cast and even but now he spake , after long seeming dead , iago hurt him , iago set him on .
you must forsake this room , and go with us your power and your command is taken off , and cassio rules in cyprus .
for this slave , if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long , it shall be his .
you shall close prisoner rest , till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state .
come , bring him away .
soft you , a word or two before you go .
i have done the state some service , and they .
no more of that .
i pray you , in your letters , when you shall these unlucky deeds relate , speak of me as i am , nothing extenuate , nor set down aught in malice then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well , of one not easily jealous , but being wrought perplex in the extreme , of one whose hand , like the base indian , threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe , of one whose subdued eyes , albeit unused to the melting mood , drop tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinal gum .
set you down this , and say besides , that in aleppo once , where a malignant and a turban turk beat a venetian and traduced the state , i took by the throat the circumcised dog , and smote him , thus .
stabs himself o bloody period !
all that spoke is marr .
i kiss thee ere i kill thee no way but this , killing myself , to die upon a kiss .
falls on the bed , and dies this did i fear , but thought he had no weapon , for he was great of heart .
to iago o spartan dog , more fell than anguish , hunger , or the sea !
look on the tragic loading of this bed , this is thy work the object poisons sight , let it be hid .
gratiano , keep the house , and seize upon the fortunes of the moor , for they succeed on you .
to you , lord governor , remains the censure of this hellish villain , the time , the place , the torture o , enforce it !
myself will straight aboard and to the state this heavy act with heavy heart relate .
exeunt act i prologue enter gower before the palace of antioch to sing a song that old was sung , from ashes ancient gower is come , assuming man infirmities , to glad your ear , and please your eyes .
it hath been sung at festivals , on and , and lords and ladies in their lives have read it for restoratives the purchase is to make men glorious , et bonum quo antiquius , eo melius .
if you , born in these latter times , when wit more ripe , accept my rhymes .
and that to hear an old man sing may to your wishes pleasure bring i life would wish , and that i might waste it for you , like .
this antioch , then , antiochus the great built up , this city , for his chiefest seat the fairest in all syria , i tell you what mine authors say this king unto him took a fere , who died and left a female heir , so buxom , blithe , and full of face , as heaven had lent her all his grace , with whom the father liking took , and her to incest did provoke bad child , worse father !
to entice his own to evil should be done by none but custom what they did begin was with long use account no sin .
the beauty of this sinful dame made many princes thither frame , to seek her as a , in which to prevent he made a law , to keep her still , and men in awe , that whoso ask her for his wife , his riddle told not , lost his life so for her many a wight did die , as yon grim looks do testify .
what now ensues , to the judgment of your eye i give , my cause who best can justify .
exit scene antioch .
a room in the palace .
enter antiochus , prince pericles , and followers young prince of tyre , you have at large received the danger of the task you undertake .
i have , antiochus , and , with a soul embolden with the glory of her praise , think death no hazard in this enterprise .
bring in our daughter , clothed like a bride , for the embracements even of jove himself , at whose conception , till lucina reign , nature this dowry gave , to glad her presence , the of planets all did sit , to knit in her their best perfections .
music .
enter the daughter of antiochus see where she comes , apparell like the spring , graces her subjects , and her thoughts the king of every virtue gives renown to men !
her face the book of praises , where is read nothing but curious pleasures , as from thence sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath could never be her mild companion .
you gods that made me man , and sway in love , that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree , or die in the adventure , be my helps , as i am son and servant to your will , to compass such a boundless happiness !
prince pericles , that would be son to great antiochus .
before thee stands this fair hesperides , with golden fruit , but dangerous to be touch , for dragons here affright thee hard her face , like heaven , enticeth thee to view her countless glory , which desert must gain , and which , without desert , because thine eye presumes to reach , all thy whole heap must die .
yon sometimes famous princes , like thyself , drawn by report , adventurous by desire , tell thee , with speechless tongues and semblance pale , that without covering , save yon field of stars , here they stand martyrs , slain in cupid wars , and with dead cheeks advise thee to desist for going on death net , whom none resist .
antiochus , i thank thee , who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself , and by those fearful objects to prepare this body , like to them , to what i must , for death remember should be like a mirror , who tells us life but breath , to trust it error .
i make my will then , and , as sick men do who know the world , see heaven , but , feeling woe , gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did , so i bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men , as every prince should do , my riches to the earth from whence they came , but my unspotted fire of love to you .
to the daughter of antiochus thus ready for the way of life or death , i wait the sharpest blow , antiochus .
scorning advice , read the conclusion then which read and not expounded , is decreed , as these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed .
of all say yet , mayst thou prove prosperous !
of all say yet , i wish thee happiness !
like a bold champion , i assume the lists , nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness and courage .
he reads the riddle i am no viper , yet i feed on mother flesh which did me breed .
i sought a husband , in which labour i found that kindness in a father he father , son , and husband mild , i mother , wife , and yet his child .
how they may be , and yet in two , as you will live , resolve it you .
sharp physic is the last but , o you powers that give heaven countless eyes to view men acts , why cloud they not their sights perpetually , if this be true , which makes me pale to read it ?
fair glass of light , i loved you , and could still , takes hold of the hand of the daughter of antiochus were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you , now my thoughts revolt for he no man on whom perfections wait that , knowing sin within , will touch the gate .
you are a fair viol , and your sense the strings , who , finger to make man his lawful music , would draw heaven down , and all the gods , to hearken but being play upon before your time , hell only danceth at so harsh a chime .
good sooth , i care not for you .
prince pericles , touch not , upon thy life .
for that an article within our law , as dangerous as the rest .
your time expired either expound now , or receive your sentence .
great king , few love to hear the sins they love to act , braid yourself too near for me to tell it .
who has a book of all that monarchs do , he more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wandering wind .
blows dust in other eyes , to spread itself , and yet the end of all is bought thus dear , the breath is gone , and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them .
the blind mole casts copp hills towards heaven , to tell the earth is throng by man oppression , and the poor worm doth die .
kings are earth gods , in vice their law their will , and if jove stray , who dares say jove doth ill ?
it is enough you know , and it is fit , what being more known grows worse , to smother it .
all love the womb that their first being bred , then give my tongue like leave to love my head .
aside heaven , that i had thy head !
he has found the meaning but i will gloze with young prince of tyre , though by the tenor of our strict edict , your exposition misinterpreting , we might proceed to cancel of your days , yet hope , succeeding from so fair a tree as your fair self , doth tune us otherwise forty days longer we do respite you , if by which time our secret be undone , this mercy shows we joy in such a son and until then your entertain shall be as doth befit our honour and your worth .
exeunt all but pericles how courtesy would seem to cover sin , when what is done is like an hypocrite , the which is good in nothing but in sight !
if it be true that i interpret false , then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul , where now you both a father and a son , by your untimely claspings with your child , which pleasure fits an husband , not a father , and she an eater of her mother flesh , by the defiling of her parent bed , and both like serpents are , who though they feed on sweetest flowers , yet they poison breed .
antioch , farewell !
for wisdom sees , those men blush not in actions blacker than the night , will shun no course to keep them from the light .
one sin , i know , another doth provoke , murder as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin , ay , and the targets , to put off the shame then , lest my lie be cropp to keep you clear , by flight i shun the danger which i fear .
exit antiochus he hath found the meaning , for which we mean to have his head .
he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy , nor tell the world antiochus doth sin in such a loathed manner , and therefore instantly this prince must die for by his fall my honour must keep high .
who attends us there ?
enter thaliard doth your highness call ?
thaliard , you are of our chamber , and our mind partakes her private actions to your secrecy , and for your faithfulness we will advance you .
thaliard , behold , here poison , and here gold , we hate the prince of tyre , and thou must kill him it fits thee not to ask the reason why , because we bid it .
say , is it done ?
my lord , is done .
enough .
enter a messenger let your breath cool yourself , telling your haste .
my lord , prince pericles is fled .
exit as thou wilt live , fly after and like an arrow shot from a archer hits the mark his eye doth level at , so thou return unless thou say pericles is dead . '
my lord , if i can get him within my pistol length , i make him sure enough so , farewell to your highness .
thaliard , adieu !
exit thaliard till pericles be dead , my heart can lend no succor to my head .
exit scene ii .
tyre .
a room in the palace .
enter pericles to lords without let none disturb why should this change of thoughts , the sad companion , melancholy , be my so used a guest as not an hour , in the day glorious walk , or peaceful night , the tomb where grief should sleep , can breed me quiet ?
here pleasures court mine eyes , and mine eyes shun them , and danger , which i fear , is at antioch , whose aim seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasure art can joy my spirits , nor yet the other distance comfort me .
then it is thus the passions of the mind , that have their first conception by , have and life by care , and what was first but fear what might be done , grows elder now and cares it be not done .
and so with me the great antiochus , whom i am too little to contend , since he so great can make his will his act , will think me speaking , though i swear to silence , nor boots it me to say i honour him .
if he suspect i may dishonour him and what may make him blush in being known , he stop the course by which it might be known , with hostile forces he the land , and with the ostent of war will look so huge , amazement shall drive courage from the state , our men be vanquish ere they do resist , and subjects punish that thought offence which care of them , not pity of myself , who am no more but as the tops of trees , which fence the roots they grow by and defend them , makes both my body pine and soul to languish , and punish that before that he would punish .
enter helicanus , with other lords joy and all comfort in your sacred breast !
and keep your mind , till you return to us , peaceful and comfortable !
peace , peace , and give experience tongue .
they do abuse the king that flatter him for flattery is the bellows blows up sin , the thing which is flatter , but a spark , to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing , whereas reproof , obedient and in order , fits kings , as they are men , for they may err .
when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace , he flatters you , makes war upon your life .
prince , pardon me , or strike me , if you please , i can not be much lower than my knees .
all leave us else , but let your cares what shipping and what lading in our haven , and then return to us .
exeunt lords helicanus , thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks ?
an angry brow , dread lord .
if there be such a dart in princes ' frowns , how durst thy tongue move anger to our face ?
how dare the plants look up to heaven , from whence they have their nourishment ?
thou i have power to take thy life from thee .
kneeling i have ground the axe myself , do you but strike the blow .
rise , prithee , rise .
sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for it , and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid !
fit counsellor and servant for a prince , who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant , what wouldst thou have me do ?
to bear with patience such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself .
thou like a physician , helicanus , that a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself .
attend me , then i went to antioch , where as thou , against the face of death , i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty .
from whence an issue i might propagate , are arms to princes , and bring joys to subjects .
her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder , the rest hark in thine ear as black as incest which by my knowledge found , the sinful father seem not to strike , but smooth but thou this , is time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss .
such fear so grew in me , i hither fled , under the covering of a careful night , who seem my good protector , and , being here , bethought me what was past , what might succeed .
i knew him tyrannous , and tyrants ' fears decrease not , but grow faster than the years and should he doubt it , as no doubt he doth , that i should open to the listening air how many worthy princes ' bloods were shed , to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope , to lop that doubt , he fill this land with arms , and make pretence of wrong that i have done him when all , for mine , if i may call offence , must feel war blow , who spares not innocence which love to all , of which thyself art one , who now reprovest me for it , alas , sir !
drew sleep out of mine eyes , blood from my cheeks , musings into my mind , with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came , and finding little comfort to relieve them , i thought it princely charity to grieve them .
well , my lord , since you have given me leave to speak .
freely will i speak .
antiochus you fear , and justly too , i think , you fear the tyrant , who either by public war or private treason will take away your life .
therefore , my lord , go travel for a while , till that his rage and anger be forgot , or till the destinies do cut his thread of life .
your rule direct to any , if to me .
day serves not light more faithful than i be .
i do not doubt thy faith , but should he wrong my liberties in my absence ?
we mingle our bloods together in the earth , from whence we had our being and our birth .
tyre , i now look from thee then , and to tarsus intend my travel , where i hear from thee , and by whose letters i dispose myself .
the care i had and have of subjects ' good on thee i lay whose wisdom strength can bear it .
i take thy word for faith , not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will sure crack both but in our orbs we live so round and safe , that time of both this truth shall convince , thou a subject shine , i a true prince .
exeunt scene iii .
tyre .
an in the palace .
enter thaliard so , this is tyre , and this the court .
here must i kill king pericles , and if i do it not , i am sure to be hanged at home is dangerous .
well , i perceive he was a wise fellow , and had good discretion , that , being bid to ask what he would of the king , desired he might know none of his secrets now do i see he had some reason , for if a king bid a man be a villain , he bound by the indenture of his oath to be one !
hush !
here come the lords of tyre .
enter helicanus and escanes , with other lords of tyre you shall not need , my fellow peers of tyre , further to question me of your king departure his seal commission , left in trust with me , doth speak sufficiently he gone to travel .
aside how !
the king gone !
if further yet you will be satisfied , why , as it were unlicensed of your loves , he would depart , i give some light unto you .
being at antioch aside what from antioch ?
royal antiochus on what cause i know not took some displeasure at him , at least he judged so and doubting lest that he had err or sinn , to show his sorrow , correct himself , so puts himself unto the shipman toil , with whom each minute threatens life or death .
aside well , i perceive i shall not be hang now , although i would , but since he gone , the king seas must please he the land , to perish at the sea .
i present myself .
peace to the lords of tyre !
lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome .
from him i come with message unto princely pericles , but since my landing i have understood your lord has betook himself to unknown travels , my message must return from whence it came .
we have no reason to desire it , commended to our master , not to us yet , ere you shall depart , this we desire , as friends to antioch , we may feast in tyre .
exeunt scene iv .
tarsus .
a room in the governor house .
enter cleon , the governor of tarsus , with dionyza , and others my dionyza , shall we rest us here , and by relating tales of others ' griefs , see if teach us to forget our own ?
that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it , for who digs hills because they do aspire throws down one mountain to cast up a higher .
o my distressed lord , even such our griefs are , here they but felt , and seen with mischief eyes , but like to groves , being topp , they higher rise .
o dionyza , who wanteth food , and will not say he wants it , or can conceal his hunger till he famish ?
our tongues and sorrows do sound deep our woes into the air , our eyes do weep , till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder , that , if heaven slumber while their creatures want , they may awake their helps to comfort them .
i then discourse our woes , felt several years , and wanting breath to speak help me with tears .
i do my best , sir .
this tarsus , which i have the government , a city on whom plenty held full hand , for riches strew herself even in the streets , whose towers bore heads so high they kiss the clouds , and strangers beheld but wondered at , whose men and dames so jetted and adorn , like one another glass to trim them by their tables were stored full , to glad the sight , and not so much to feed on as delight , all poverty was scorn , and pride so great , the name of help grew odious to repeat .
o , is too true .
but see what heaven can do !
by this our change , these mouths , who but of late , earth , sea , and air , were all too little to content and please , although they gave their creatures in abundance , as houses are defiled for want of use , they are now starved for want of exercise those palates who , not yet two summers younger , must have inventions to delight the taste , would now be glad of bread , and beg for it those mothers who , to nousle up their babes , thought nought too curious , are ready now to eat those little darlings whom they loved .
so sharp are hunger teeth , that man and wife draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life here stands a lord , and there a lady weeping , here many sink , yet those which see them fall have scarce strength left to give them burial .
is not this true ?
our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it .
o , let those cities that of plenty cup and her prosperities so largely taste , with their superfluous riots , hear these tears !
the misery of tarsus may be theirs .
enter a lord where the lord governor ?
here .
speak out thy sorrows which thou in haste , for comfort is too far for us to expect .
we have descried , upon our neighbouring shore , a portly sail of ships make hitherward .
i thought as much .
one sorrow never comes but brings an heir , that may succeed as his inheritor , and so in ours some neighbouring nation , taking advantage of our misery , hath stuff these hollow vessels with their power , to beat us down , the which are down already , and make a conquest of unhappy me , whereas no glory got to overcome .
that the least fear , for , by the semblance of their white flags display , they bring us peace , and come to us as favourers , not as foes .
thou like him untutor to repeat who makes the fairest show means most deceit .
but bring they what they will and what they can , what need we fear ?
the ground the lowest , and we are half way there .
go tell their general we attend him here , to know for what he comes , and whence he comes , and what he craves .
i go , my lord .
exit welcome is peace , if he on peace consist , if wars , we are unable to resist .
enter pericles with attendants lord governor , for so we hear you are , let not our ships and number of our men be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes .
we have heard your miseries as far as tyre , and seen the desolation of your streets nor come we to add sorrow to your tears , but to relieve them of their heavy load , and these our ships , you happily may think are like the trojan horse was stuff within with bloody veins , expecting overthrow , are stored with corn to make your needy bread , and give them life whom hunger starved half dead .
the gods of greece protect you !
and we pray for you .
arise , i pray you , rise we do not look for reverence , but to love , and harbourage for ourself , our ships , and men .
the which when any shall not gratify , or pay you with unthankfulness in thought , be it our wives , our children , or ourselves , the curse of heaven and men succeed their evils !
till when , the which i hope shall be seen , your grace is welcome to our town and us .
which welcome we accept , feast here awhile , until our stars that frown lend us a smile .
exeunt act ii enter gower here have you seen a mighty king his child , i wis , to incest bring , a better prince and benign lord , that will prove awful both in deed and word .
be quiet then as men should be , till he hath pass necessity .
i show you those in troubles reign , losing a mite , a mountain gain .
the good in conversation , to whom i give my benison , is still at tarsus , where each man thinks all is writ he speken can , and , to remember what he does , build his statue to make him glorious but tidings to the contrary are brought your eyes , what need speak i ?
dumb show .
enter at one door pericles talking with cleon , all the train with them .
enter at another door a gentleman , with a letter to pericles , pericles shows the letter to cleon , gives the messenger a reward , and knights him .
exit pericles at one door , and cleon at another good helicane , that stay at home , not to eat honey like a drone from others ' labours , for though he strive to killen bad , keep good alive , and to fulfil his prince ' desire , sends word of all that haps in tyre how thaliard came full bent with sin and had intent to murder him , and that in tarsus was not best longer for him to make his rest .
he , doing so , put forth to seas , where when men been , there seldom ease , for now the wind begins to blow , thunder above and deeps below make such unquiet , that the ship should house him safe is wreck and split , and he , good prince , having all lost , by waves from coast to coast is tost all perishen of man , of pelf , ne aught escapen but himself , till fortune , tired with doing bad , threw him ashore , to give him glad and here he comes .
what shall be next , pardon old gower , this longs the text .
exit scene pentapolis .
an open place by the .
enter pericles , wet yet cease your ire , you angry stars of heaven !
wind , rain , and thunder , remember , earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you , and i , as fits my nature , do obey you alas , the sea hath cast me on the rocks , wash me from shore to shore , and left me breath nothing to think on but ensuing death let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes , and having thrown him from your watery grave , here to have death in peace is all he crave .
enter three fishermen what , ho , pilch !
ha , come and bring away the nets !
what , , i say !
what say you , master ?
look how thou stirrest now !
come away , or i fetch thee with a wanion .
faith , master , i am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now .
alas , poor souls , it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them , when , , we could scarce help ourselves .
nay , master , said not i as much when i saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled ?
they say they half fish , half flesh a plague on them , they come but i look to be washed .
master , i marvel how the fishes live in the sea .
why , as men do , the great ones eat up the little ones i can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale , a ' plays and tumbles , driving the poor fry before him , and at last devours them all at a mouthful such whales have i heard on o ' the land , who never leave gaping till they swallowed the whole parish , church , steeple , bells , and all .
aside a pretty moral .
but , master , if i had been the sexton , i would have been that day in the belfry .
why , man ?
because he should have swallowed me too and when i had been in his belly , i would have kept such a jangling of the bells , that he should never have left , till he cast bells , steeple , church , and parish up again .
but if the good king simonides were of my mind , aside simonides !
we would purge the land of these drones , that rob the bee of her honey .
aside how from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men , and from their watery empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect !
peace be at your labour , honest fishermen .
honest !
good fellow , what that ?
if it be a day fits you , search out of the calendar , and nobody look after it .
may see the sea hath cast upon your coast .
what a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way !
a man whom both the waters and the wind , in that vast , have made the ball for them to play upon , entreats you pity him he asks of you , that never used to beg .
no , friend , can not you beg ?
here them in our country greece gets more with begging than we can do with working .
canst thou catch any fishes , then ?
i never practised it .
nay , then thou wilt starve , sure , for here nothing to be got , unless thou canst fish .
what i have been i have forgot to know , but what i am , want teaches me to think on a man throng up with cold my veins are chill , and have no more of life than may suffice to give my tongue that heat to ask your help , which if you shall refuse , when i am dead , for that i am a man , pray see me buried .
die ?
now gods forbid !
i have a gown here , come , put it on , keep thee warm .
now , afore me , a handsome fellow !
come , thou shalt go home , and we have flesh for holidays , fish for , and puddings and , and thou shalt be welcome .
i thank you , sir .
hark you , my friend , you said you could not beg .
i did but crave .
but crave !
then i turn craver too , and so i shall whipping .
why , are all your beggars whipped , then ?
o , not all , my friend , not all , for if all your beggars were whipped , i would wish no better office than to be beadle .
but , master , i go draw up the net .
exit with third fisherman aside how well this honest mirth becomes their labour !
hark you , sir , do you know where ye are ?
not well .
why , i tell you this is called pentapolis , and our king the good simonides .
the good king simonides , do you call him .
ay , sir , and he deserves so to be called for his peaceable reign and good government .
he is a happy king , since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government .
how far is his court distant from this shore ?
marry , sir , half a day journey and i tell you , he hath a fair daughter , and is her , and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love .
were my fortunes equal to my desires , i could wish to make one there .
o , sir , things must be as they may , and what a man can not get , he may lawfully deal for his wife soul .
second and third fishermen , drawing up a net help , master , help !
here a fish hangs in the net , like a poor man right in the law , hardly come out .
ha !
bots o , is come at last , and is turned to a rusty armour .
an armour , friends !
i pray you , let me see it .
thanks , fortune , yet , that , after all my crosses , thou givest me somewhat to repair myself , and though it was mine own , part of my heritage , which my dead father did bequeath to me .
with this strict charge , even as he left his life , it , my pericles , it hath been a shield twixt me and death , ' and pointed to this brace , that it saved me , keep it , in like necessity the which the gods protect thee from ! may defend thee . '
it kept where i kept , i so dearly loved it , till the rough seas , that spare not any man , took it in rage , though calm have give again i thank thee my shipwreck now no ill , since i have here my father gift in will .
what mean you , sir ?
to beg of you , kind friends , this coat of worth , for it was sometime target to a king , i know it by this mark .
he loved me dearly , and for his sake i wish the having of it , and that guide me to your sovereign court , where with it i may appear a gentleman , and if that ever my low fortune better , i pay your bounties , till then rest your debtor .
why , wilt thou tourney for the lady ?
i show the virtue i have borne in arms .
why , do ' e take it , and the gods give thee good o !
ay , but hark you , my friend , was we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the waters there are certain condolements , certain vails .
i hope , sir , if you thrive , you remember from whence you had it .
believe , i will .
by your furtherance i am clothed in steel , and , spite of all the rapture of the sea , this jewel holds his building on my arm unto thy value i will mount myself upon a courser , whose delightful steps shall make the gazer joy to see him tread .
only , my friend , i yet am unprovided of a pair of bases .
we sure provide thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair , and i bring thee to the court myself .
then honour be but a goal to my will , this day i rise , or else add ill to exeunt scene ii .
the same .
a public way or platform leading to the lists .
a pavilion by the side of it for the reception of king , princess , lords , and enter simonides , thaisa , lords , and attendants are the knights ready to begin the triumph ?
they are , my liege , and stay your coming to present themselves .
return them , we are ready , and our daughter , in honour of whose birth these triumphs are , sits here , like beauty child , whom nature gat for men to see , and seeing wonder at .
exit a lord it pleaseth you , my royal father , to express my commendations great , whose merit less .
it fit it should be so , for princes are a model which heaven makes like to itself as jewels lose their glory if neglected , so princes their renowns if not respected .
is now your honour , daughter , to explain the labour of each knight in his device .
which , to preserve mine honour , i perform .
enter a knight , he passes over , and his squire presents his shield to the princess who is the first that doth prefer himself ?
a knight of sparta , my renowned father , and the device he bears upon his shield is a black ethiope reaching at the sun the word , tua vita mihi . '
he loves you well that holds his life of you .
the second knight passes over who is the second that presents himself ?
a prince of macedon , my royal father , and the device he bears upon his shield is an arm knight that conquer by a lady , the motto thus , in spanish , por dulzura que por fuerza . '
the third knight passes over and what the third ?
the third of antioch , and his device , a wreath of chivalry , the word , pompae provexit apex . '
the fourth knight passes over what is the fourth ?
a burning torch that turned upside down , the word , me alit , me extinguit . '
which shows that beauty hath his power and will , which can as well inflame as it can kill .
the fifth knight passes over the fifth , an hand environed with clouds , holding out gold that by the touchstone tried , the motto thus , spectanda fides . '
the sixth knight , pericles , passes over and what the sixth and last , the which the knight himself with such a graceful courtesy deliver ?
he seems to be a stranger , but his present is a wither branch , that only green at top , the motto , hac spe vivo . '
a pretty moral , from the dejected state wherein he is , he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish .
he had need mean better than his outward show can any way speak in his just commend , for by his rusty outside he appears to have practised more the whipstock than the lance .
he well may be a stranger , for he comes to an honour triumph strangely furnished .
and on set purpose let his armour rust until this day , to scour it in the dust .
opinion but a fool , that makes us scan the outward habit by the inward man .
but stay , the knights are coming we will withdraw into the gallery .
exeunt great shouts within and all cry mean knight ! '
scene iii .
the same .
a hall of state a banquet prepared .
enter simonides , thaisa , lords , attendants , and knights , from tilting knights , to say you welcome were superfluous .
to place upon the volume of your deeds , as in a , your worth in arms , were more than you expect , or more than fit , since every worth in show commends itself .
prepare for mirth , for mirth becomes a feast you are princes and my guests .
but you , my knight and guest , to whom this wreath of victory i give , and crown you king of this day happiness .
is more by fortune , lady , than by merit .
call it by what you will , the day is yours , and here , i hope , is none that envies it .
in framing an artist , art hath thus decreed , to make some good , but others to exceed , and you are her labour scholar .
come , queen o ' the feast , for , daughter , so you are , here take your place marshal the rest , as they deserve their grace .
we are honour much by good simonides .
your presence glads our days honour we love , for who hates honour hates the gods above .
sir , yonder is your place .
some other is more fit .
contend not , sir , for we are gentlemen that neither in our hearts nor outward eyes envy the great nor do the low despise .
you are right courteous knights .
sit , sir , sit .
by jove , i wonder , that is king of thoughts , these cates resist me , she but thought upon .
by juno , that is queen of marriage , all viands that i eat do seem unsavoury .
wishing him my meat .
sure , he a gallant gentleman .
he but a country gentleman , has done no more than other knights have done , has broken a staff or so , so let it pass .
to me he seems like diamond to glass .
yon king to me like to my father picture , which tells me in that glory once he was , had princes sit , like stars , about his throne , and he the sun , for them to reverence , none that beheld him , but , like lesser lights , did vail their crowns to his supremacy where now his son like a in the night , the which hath fire in darkness , none in light whereby i see that time the king of men , he both their parent , and he is their grave , and gives them what he will , not what they crave .
what , are you merry , knights ?
who can be other in this royal presence ?
here , with a cup that stored unto the brim , as you do love , fill to your mistress ' lips , we drink this health to you .
we thank your grace .
yet pause awhile yon knight doth sit too melancholy , as if the entertainment in our court had not a show might countervail his worth .
note it not you , thaisa ?
what is it to me , my father ?
o , attend , my daughter princes in this should live like gods above , who freely give to every one that comes to honour them and princes not doin g so are like to gnats , which make a sound , but kill are wonder at .
therefore to make his entrance more sweet , here , say we drink this of wine to him .
alas , my father , it befits not me unto a stranger knight to be so bold he may my proffer take for an offence , since men take women gifts for impudence .
how !
do as i bid you , or you move me else .
aside now , by the gods , he could not please me better .
and furthermore tell him , we desire to know of him , of whence he is , his name and parentage .
the king my father , sir , has drunk to you .
i thank him .
wishing it so much blood unto your life .
i thank both him and you , and pledge him freely .
and further he desires to know of you , of whence you are , your name and parentage .
a gentleman of tyre , my name , pericles , my education been in arts and arms , who , looking for adventures in the world , was by the rough seas reft of ships and men , and after shipwreck driven upon this shore .
he thanks your grace , names himself pericles , a gentleman of tyre , who only by misfortune of the seas bereft of ships and men , cast on this shore .
now , by the gods , i pity his misfortune , and will awake him from his melancholy .
come , gentlemen , we sit too long on trifles , and waste the time , which looks for other revels .
even in your armours , as you are address , will very well become a soldier dance .
i will not have excuse , with saying this loud music is too harsh for ladies ' heads , since they love men in arms as well as beds .
the knights dance so , this was well ask , was so well perform .
come , sir , here is a lady that wants breathing too and i have heard , you knights of tyre are excellent in making ladies trip , and that their measures are as excellent .
in those that practise them they are , my lord .
o , that as much as you would be denied of your fair courtesy .
the knights and ladies dance unclasp , unclasp thanks , gentlemen , to all , all have done well .
to pericles but you the best .
pages and lights , to conduct these knights unto their several lodgings !
to pericles yours , sir , we have given order to be next our own .
i am at your grace pleasure .
princes , it is too late to talk of love , and that the mark i know you level at therefore each one betake him to his rest , all for speeding do their best .
exeunt scene iv .
tyre .
a room in the governor house .
enter helicanus and escanes no , escanes , know this of me , antiochus from incest lived not free for which , the most high gods not minding longer to withhold the vengeance that they had in store , due to this heinous capital offence , even in the height and pride of all his glory , when he was seated in a chariot of an inestimable value , and his daughter with him , a fire from heaven came and shrivell up their bodies , even to loathing , for they so stunk , that all those eyes adored them ere their fall scorn now their hand should give them burial .
was very strange .
and yet but justice , for though this king were great , his greatness was no guard to bar heaven shaft , but sin had his reward .
is very true .
enter two or three lords see , not a man in private conference or council has respect with him but he .
it shall no longer grieve without reproof .
and cursed be he that will not second it .
follow me , then .
lord helicane , a word .
with me ?
and welcome happy day , my lords .
know that our griefs are risen to the top , and now at length they overflow their banks .
your griefs !
for what ?
wrong not your prince you love .
wrong not yourself , then , noble helicane , but if the prince do live , let us salute him , or know what ground made happy by his breath .
if in the world he live , we seek him out , if in his grave he rest , we find him there , and be resolved he lives to govern us , or dead , give cause to mourn his funeral , and leave us to our free election .
whose death indeed the strongest in our censure and knowing this kingdom is without a head , like goodly buildings left without a roof soon fall to ruin , your noble self , that best know how to rule and how to reign , we thus submit unto , our sovereign .
live , noble helicane !
for honour cause , forbear your suffrages if that you love prince pericles , forbear .
take i your wish , i leap into the seas , where hourly trouble for a minute ease .
a twelvemonth longer , let me entreat you to forbear the absence of your king if in which time expired , he not return , i shall with aged patience bear your yoke .
but if i can not win you to this love , go search like nobles , like noble subjects , and in your search spend your adventurous worth , whom if you find , and win unto return , you shall like diamonds sit about his crown .
to wisdom he a fool that will not yield , and since lord helicane enjoineth us , we with our travels will endeavour us .
then you love us , we you , and we clasp hands when peers thus knit , a kingdom ever stands .
exeunt scene pentapolis .
a room in the palace .
enter simonides , reading a letter , at one door the knights meet him good morrow to the good simonides .
knights , from my daughter this i let you know , that for this twelvemonth she not undertake a married life .
her reason to herself is only known , which yet from her by no means can i get .
may we not get access to her , my lord ?
, by no means , she has so strictly tied her to her chamber , that is impossible .
one twelve moons more she wear diana livery , this by the eye of cynthia hath she vow and on her virgin honour will not break it .
loath to bid farewell , we take our leaves .
exeunt knights so , they are well dispatch , now to my daughter letter she tells me here , she wed the stranger knight , or never more to view nor day nor light .
is well , mistress , your choice agrees with mine , i like that well nay , how absolute she i , not minding whether i dislike or no !
well , i do commend her choice , and will no longer have it be delay .
soft !
here he comes i must dissemble it .
enter pericles all fortune to the good simonides !
to you as much , sir !
i am beholding to you for your sweet music this last night i do protest my ears were never better fed with such delightful pleasing harmony .
it is your grace pleasure to commend , not my desert .
sir , you are music master .
the worst of all her scholars , my good lord .
let me ask you one thing what do you think of my daughter , sir ?
a most virtuous princess .
and she is fair too , is she not ?
as a fair day in summer , wondrous fair .
sir , my daughter thinks very well of you , ay , so well , that you must be her master , and she will be your scholar therefore look to it .
i am unworthy for her schoolmaster .
she thinks not so , peruse this writing else .
aside what here ?
a letter , that she loves the knight of tyre !
is the king subtlety to have my life .
o , seek not to entrap me , gracious lord , a stranger and distressed gentleman , that never aim so high to love your daughter , but bent all offices to honour her .
thou hast bewitch my daughter , and thou art a villain .
by the gods , i have not never did thought of mine levy offence , nor never did my actions yet commence a deed might gain her love or your displeasure .
traitor , thou liest .
traitor !
ay , traitor .
even in his throat unless it be the king that calls me traitor , i return the lie .
aside now , by the gods , i do applaud his courage .
my actions are as noble as my thoughts , that never relish of a base descent .
i came unto your court for honour cause , and not to be a rebel to her state , and he that otherwise accounts of me , this sword shall prove he honour enemy .
no ?
here comes my daughter , she can witness it .
enter thaisa then , as you are as virtuous as fair , resolve your angry father , if my tongue did ere solicit , or my hand subscribe to any syllable that made love to you .
why , sir , say if you had , who takes offence at that would make me glad ?
yea , mistress , are you so peremptory ?
aside i am glad o with all my i tame you , i bring you in subjection .
will you , not having my consent , bestow your love and your affections upon a stranger ?
aside who , for aught i know , may be , nor can i think the contrary , as great in blood as i therefore hear you , mistress , either frame your will to mine , and you , sir , hear you , either be ruled by me , or i will make you man and wife nay , come , your hands and lips must seal it too and being join , i thus your hopes destroy , and for a further grief , god give you joy ! what , are you both pleased ?
yes , if you love me , sir .
even as my life , or blood that fosters it .
what , are you both agreed ?
yes , if it please your majesty .
it pleaseth me so well , that i will see you wed , and then with what haste you can get you to bed .
exeunt act iii enter gower now sleep hath the rout , no din but snores the house about , made louder by the breast of this most pompous .
the cat , with eyne of burning coal , now crouches fore the mouse hole , and crickets sing at the oven mouth , the blither for their drouth .
hymen hath brought the bride to bed .
where , by the loss of maidenhead , a babe is moulded .
be attent , and time that is so briefly spent with your fine fancies quaintly eche what dumb in show i plain with speech .
dumb show .
enter , pericles and simonides at one door , with attendants , a messenger meets them , kneels , and gives pericles a letter pericles shows it simonides , the lords kneel to him .
then enter thaisa with child , with lychorida a nurse .
the king shows her the letter , she rejoices she and pericles takes leave of her father , and depart with lychorida and their attendants .
then exeunt simonides and the rest by many a dern and painful perch of pericles the careful search , by the four opposing coigns which the world together joins , is made with all due diligence that horse and sail and high expense can stead the quest .
at last from tyre , fame answering the most strange inquire , to the court of king simonides are letters brought , the tenor these antiochus and his daughter dead , the men of tyrus on the head of helicanus would set on the crown of tyre , but he will none the mutiny he there hastes t ' oppress , says to , if king pericles come not home in twice six moons , he , obedient to their dooms , will take the crown .
the sum of this , brought hither to pentapolis , the regions round , and every one with claps can sound , is a king !
who dream , who thought of such a thing ? '
brief , he must hence depart to tyre his queen with child makes her desire which who shall cross ? along to go omit we all their dole and woe lychorida , her nurse , she takes , and so to sea .
their vessel shakes on neptune billow , half the flood hath their keel cut but fortune mood varies again , the grisly north disgorges such a tempest forth , that , as a duck for life that dives , so up and down the poor ship drives the lady shrieks , and does fall in travail with her fear and what ensues in this fell storm shall for itself itself perform .
i nill relate , action may conveniently the rest convey , which might not what by me is told .
in your imagination hold this stage the ship , upon whose deck the pericles appears to speak .
exit scene i enter pericles , on shipboard thou god of this great vast , rebuke these surges , which wash both heaven and hell , and thou , that hast upon the winds command , bind them in brass , having call them from the deep !
o , still thy deafening , dreadful thunders , gently quench thy nimble , sulphurous flashes !
o , how , lychorida , how does my queen ?
thou stormest venomously , wilt thou spit all thyself ?
the seaman whistle is as a whisper in the ears of death , unheard .
lychorida ! lucina , o divinest patroness , and midwife gentle to those that cry by night , convey thy deity aboard our dancing boat , make swift the pangs of my queen travails !
enter lychorida , with an infant now , lychorida !
here is a thing too young for such a place , who , if it had conceit , would die , as i am like to do take in your arms this piece of your dead queen .
how , how , lychorida !
patience , good sir , do not assist the storm .
here all that is left living of your queen , a little daughter for the sake of it , be manly , and take comfort .
o you gods !
why do you make us love your goodly gifts , and snatch them straight away ?
we here below recall not what we give , and therein may use honour with you .
patience , good sir , even for this charge .
now , mild may be thy life !
for a more blustrous birth had never babe quiet and gentle thy conditions !
for thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world that ever was prince child .
happy what follows !
thou hast as chiding a nativity as fire , air , water , earth , and heaven can make , to herald thee from the womb even at the first thy loss is more than can thy portage quit , with all thou canst find here .
now , the good gods throw their best eyes upo !
enter two sailors what courage , sir ?
god save you !
courage enough i do not fear the flaw , it hath done to me the worst .
yet , for the love of this poor infant , this , i would it would be quiet .
slack the bolins there !
thou wilt not , wilt thou ?
blow , and split thyself .
but , an the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon , i care not .
sir , your queen must overboard the sea works high , the wind is loud , and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead .
that your superstition .
pardon us , sir , with us at sea it hath been still observed and we are strong in custom .
therefore briefly yield her , for she must overboard straight .
as you think meet .
most wretched queen !
here she lies , sir .
a terrible childbed hast thou had , my dear , no light , no fire the unfriendly elements forgot thee utterly nor have i time to give thee hallow to thy grave , but straight must cast thee , scarcely coffin , in the ooze , where , for a monument upon thy bones , and lamps , the belching whale and humming water must thy corpse , lying with simple shells .

exit lychorida sir , we have a chest beneath the hatches , caulked and bitumed ready .
i thank thee .
mariner , say what coast is this ?
we are near tarsus .
thither , gentle mariner .
alter thy course for tyre .
when canst thou reach it ?
by break of day , if the wind cease .
o , make for tarsus !

exeunt scene ii .
ephesus .
a room in cerimon house .
enter cerimon , with a servant , and some persons who have been shipwrecked philemon , ho !
enter philemon doth my lord call ?
get fire and meat for these poor men has been a turbulent and stormy night .
i have been in many , but such a night as this , till now , i endured .
your master will be dead ere you return , there nothing can be minister to nature that can recover him .
to philemon give this to the , and tell me how it works .
exeunt all but cerimon enter two gentlemen good morrow .
good morrow to your lordship .
gentlemen , why do you stir so early ?
sir , our lodgings , standing bleak upon the sea , shook as the earth did quake , the very principals did seem to rend , and topple pure surprise and fear made me to quit the house .
that is the cause we trouble you so early , is not our husbandry .
o , you say well .
but i much marvel that your lordship , having rich tire about you , should at these early hours shake off the golden slumber of repose .
is most strange , nature should be so conversant with pain , being thereto not compell .
i hold it ever , virtue and cunning were endowments greater than nobleness and riches careless heirs may the two latter darken and expend , but immortality attends the former .
making a man a god .
is known , i ever have studied physic , through which secret art , by turning authorities , i have , together with my practise , made familiar to me and to my aid the blest infusions that dwell in vegetives , in metals , stones , and i can speak of the disturbances that nature works , and of her cures , which doth give me a more content in course of true delight than to be thirsty after tottering honour , or tie my treasure up in silken bags , to please the fool and death .
your honour has through ephesus pour forth your charity , and hundreds call themselves your creatures , who by you have been restored and not your knowledge , your personal pain , but even your purse , still open , hath built lord cerimon such strong renown as time shall decay .
enter two or three servants with a chest so , lift there .
what is that ?
sir , even now did the sea toss upon our shore this chest is of some wreck .
set down , let look upo .
is like a coffin , sir .
it be , is wondrous heavy .
wrench it open straight if the sea stomach be with gold , is a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us .
is so , my lord .
how close is caulk and bitumed !
did the sea cast it up ?
i never saw so huge a billow , sir , as toss it upon shore .
wrench it open , soft !
it smells most sweetly in my sense .
a delicate odour .
as ever hit my nostril .
so , up with it .
o you most potent gods !
what here ?
a corse !
most strange !
shrouded in cloth of state , balm and entreasured with full bags of spices !
a passport too !
apollo , perfect me in the characters !
reads from a scroll i give to understand , if this coffin drive , i , king pericles , have lost this queen , worth all our mundane cost .
who finds her , give her burying , she was the daughter of a king besides this treasure for a fee , the gods requite his charity ! '
if thou livest , pericles , thou hast a heart that even cracks for woe !
this chanced tonight .
most likely , sir .
nay , certainly , for look how fresh she looks !
they were too rough that threw her in the sea .
make a fire within fetch hither all my boxes in my closet .
exit a servant death may usurp on nature many hours , and yet the fire of life kindle again the spirits .
i heard of an egyptian that had nine hours lien dead , who was by good appliance recovered .
a servant , with boxes , napkins , and fire well said , well said , the fire and cloths .
the rough and woeful music that we have , cause it to sound , beseech you .
the viol once more how thou , thou block !
the music there ! i pray you , give her air .
gentlemen .
this queen will live nature awakes , a warmth breathes out of her she hath not been entranced above five hours see how she gins to blow into life flower again !
the heavens , through you , increase our wonder and set up your fame forever .
she is alive , behold , her eyelids , cases to those heavenly jewels which pericles hath lost , begin to part their fringes of bright gold , the diamonds of a most praised water do appear , to make the world twice rich .
live , and make us weep to hear your fate , fair creature , rare as you seem to be .
she moves o dear diana , where am i ?
where my lord ?
what world is this ?
is not this strange ?
most rare .
hush , my gentle neighbours !
lend me your hands , to the next chamber bear her .

the gods make up the rest upon you !
your shafts of fortune , though they hurt you mortally , yet glance full wanderingly on us .
o your sweet queen !
that the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither , to have bless mine eyes with her !
we can not but obey the powers above us .
could i rage and roar as doth the sea she lies in , yet the end must be as is .
my gentle babe marina , whom , for she was born at sea , i have named so , here i charge your charity withal , leaving her the infant of your care , beseeching you to give her princely training , that she may be manner as she is born .
fear not , my lord , but think your grace , that fed my country with your corn , for which the people prayers still fall upon you , must in your child be thought on .
if neglection should therein make me vile , the common body , by you relieved , would force me to my duty but if to that my nature need a spur , the gods revenge it upon me and mine , to the end of generation !
i believe you , your honour and your goodness teach me , without your vows .
till she be married , madam , by bright diana , whom we honour , all unscissor shall this hair of mine remain , though i show ill i .
so i take my leave .
good madam , make me blessed in your care in bringing up my child .
i have one myself , who shall not be more dear to my respect than yours , my lord .
madam , my thanks and prayers .
we bring your grace to the edge o ' the shore , then give you up to the mask neptune and the gentlest winds of heaven .
i will embrace your offer .
come , dearest madam .
o , no tears , lychorida , no tears look to your little mistress , on whose grace you may depend hereafter .
come , my lord .
exeunt scene iv .
ephesus .
a room in cerimon house .
enter cerimon and thaisa madam , this letter , and some certain jewels , lay with you in your coffer which are now at your command .
know you the character ?
it is my lord .
that i was shipp at sea , i well remember , even on my eaning time , but whether there deliver , by the holy gods , i can not rightly say .
but since king pericles , my wedded lord , i shall see again , a vestal livery will i take me to , and never more have joy .
madam , if this you purpose as ye speak , diana temple is not distant far , where you may abide till your date expire .
moreover , if you please , a niece of mine shall there attend you .
my recompense is thanks , that all , yet my good will is great , though the gift small .
exeunt act iv enter gower imagine pericles arrived at tyre , welcomed and settled to his own desire .
his woeful queen we leave at ephesus , unto diana there a votaress .
now to marina bend your mind , whom our scene must find at tarsus , and by cleon train in music , letters , who hath gain of education all the grace , which makes her both the heart and place of general wonder .
but , alack , that monster envy , oft the wrack of earned praise , marina life seeks to take off by treason knife .
and in this kind hath our cleon one daughter , and a wench full grown , even ripe for , this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story , she would ever with marina be when she weaved the sleided silk with fingers long , small , white as milk , or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric , which she made more sound by hurting it , or when to the lute she sung , and made the mute , that still records with moan , or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian , still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so with the dove of paphos might the crow vie feathers white .
marina gets all praises , which are paid as debts , and not as given .
this so darks in philoten all graceful marks , that cleon wife , with envy rare , a present murderer does prepare for good marina , that her daughter might stand peerless by this slaughter .
the sooner her vile thoughts to stead , lychorida , our nurse , is dead and cursed dionyza hath the pregnant instrument of wrath prest for this blow .
the unborn event i do commend to your content only i carry winged time post on the lame feet of my rhyme , which never could i so convey , unless your thoughts went on my way .
dionyza does appear , with leonine , a murderer .
exit scene tarsus .
an open place near the .
enter dionyza and leonine thy oath remember , thou hast sworn to is but a blow , which never shall be known .
thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon , to yield thee so much profit .
let not conscience , which is but cold , inflaming love i ' thy bosom , inflame too nicely , nor let pity , which even women have cast off , melt thee , but be a soldier to thy purpose .
i will , but yet she is a goodly creature .
the fitter , then , the gods should have her .
here she comes weeping for her only mistress ' death .
thou art resolved ?
i am resolved .
enter marina , with a basket of flowers no , i will rob tellus of her weed , to strew thy green with flowers the yellows , blues , the purple violets , and marigolds , shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave , while do last .
ay me !
poor maid , born in a tempest , when my mother died , this world to me is like a lasting storm , whirring me from my friends .
how now , marina !
why do you keep alone ?
how chance my daughter is not with you ?
do not consume your blood with sorrowing you have a nurse of me .
lord , how your favour changed with this unprofitable woe !
come , give me your flowers , ere the sea mar it .
walk with leonine , the air is quick there , and it pierces and sharpens the stomach .
come , leonine , take her by the arm , walk with her .
no , i pray you , i not bereave you of your servant .
come , come , i love the king your father , and yourself , with more than foreign heart .
we every day expect him here when he shall come and find our paragon to all reports thus blasted , he will repent the breadth of his great voyage , blame both my lord and me , that we have taken no care to your best courses .
go , i pray you , walk , and be cheerful once again , reserve that excellent complexion , which did steal the eyes of young and old .
care not for me i can go home alone .
well , i will go , but yet i have no desire to it .
come , come , i know is good for you .
walk half an hour , leonine , at the least remember what i have said .
i warrant you , madam .
i leave you , my sweet lady , for a while pray , walk softly , do not heat your blood what !
i must have a care of you .
my thanks , sweet madam .
exit dionyza is this wind westerly that blows ?
.
when i was born , the wind was north .
so ?
my father , as nurse said , did never fear , but cried seaman ! '
to the sailors , galling his kingly hands , haling ropes , and , clasping to the mast , endured a sea that almost burst the deck .
when was this ?
when i was born never was waves nor wind more violent , and from the washes off a .

says one , out ? '
and with a dropping industry they skip from stem to stern the boatswain whistles , and the master calls , and trebles their confusion .
come , say your prayers .
what mean you ?
if you require a little space for prayer , i grant it pray , but be not tedious , for the gods are quick of ear , and i am sworn to do my work with haste .
why will you kill me ?
to satisfy my lady .
why would she have me kill ?
now , as i can remember , by my troth , i never did her hurt in all my life i never spake bad word , nor did ill turn to any living creature believe me , la , i never kill a mouse , nor hurt a fly i trod upon a worm against my will , but i wept for it .
how have i offended , wherein my death might yield her any profit , or my life imply her any danger ?
my commission is not to reason of the deed , but do it .
you will not for all the world , i hope .
you are well favour , and your looks foreshow you have a gentle heart .
i saw you lately , when you caught hurt in parting two that fought good sooth , it show well in you do so now your lady seeks my life , come you between , and save poor me , the weaker .
i am sworn , and will dispatch .
he seizes her enter pirates hold , villain !
leonine runs away a prize !
a prize !
, mates , .
come , let have her aboard suddenly .
exeunt pirates with marina leonine these roguing thieves serve the great pirate valdes , and they have seized marina .
let her go there no hope she will return .
i swear she dead , and thrown into the sea .
but i see further perhaps they will but please themselves upon her , not carry her aboard .
if she remain , whom they have ravish must by me be slain .
exit scene ii .
mytilene .
a room in a brothel .
enter pandar , bawd , and boult boult !
sir ?
search the market narrowly , mytilene is full of gallants .
we lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless .
we were never so much out of creatures .
we have but poor three , and they can do no more than they can do , and they with continual action are even as good as rotten .
therefore let have fresh ones , we pay for them .
if there be not a conscience to be used in every trade , we shall never prosper .
thou sayest true is not our bringing up of poor bastards , as , i think , i have brought up some eleven ay , to eleven , and brought them down again .
but shall i search the market ?
what else , man ?
the stuff we have , a strong wind will blow it to pieces , they are so pitifully sodden .
thou sayest true , they too unwholesome , o ' conscience .
the poor transylvanian is dead , that lay with the little baggage .
ay , she quickly pooped him , she made him for worms .
but i go search the market .
exit three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly , and so give over .
why to give over , i pray you ?
is it a shame to get when we are old ?
o , our credit comes not in like the commodity , nor the commodity wages not with the danger therefore , if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate , not amiss to keep our door hatched .
besides , the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over .
come , other sorts offend as well as we .
as well as we !
ay , and better too , we offend worse .
neither is our profession any trade , it no calling .
but here comes boult .
boult , with the pirates and marina to marina come your ways .
my masters , you say she a virgin ?
o , sir , we doubt it not .
master , i have gone through for this piece , you see if you like her , so , if not , i have lost my earnest .
boult , has she any qualities ?
she has a good face , speaks well , and has excellent good clothes there no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused .
what her price , boult ?
i can not be bated one doit of a thousand pieces .
well , follow me , my masters , you shall have your money presently .
wife , take her in , instruct her what she has to do , that she may not be raw in her entertainment .
exeunt pandar and pirates boult , take you the marks of her , the colour of her hair , complexion , height , age , with warrant of her virginity , and cry that will give most shall have her first . '
such a maidenhead were no cheap thing , if men were as they have been .
get this done as i command you .
performance shall follow .
exit alack that leonine was so slack , so slow !
he should have struck , not spoke , or that these pirates , not enough barbarous , had not thrown me for to seek my mother !
why lament you , pretty one ?
that i am pretty .
come , the gods have done their part in you .
i accuse them not .
you are light into my hands , where you are like to live .
the more my fault to scape his hands where i was like to die .
ay , and you shall live in pleasure .
no .
yes , indeed shall you , and taste gentlemen of all fashions you shall fare well , you shall have the difference of all complexions .
what !
do you stop your ears ?
are you a woman ?
what would you have me be , an i be not a woman ?
an honest woman , or not a woman .
marry , whip thee , gosling i think i shall have something to do with you .
come , you a young foolish sapling , and must be bowed as i would have you .
the gods defend me !
if it please the gods to defend you by men , then men must comfort you , men must feed you , men must stir you up .
boult returned .
boult now , sir , hast thou cried her through the market ?
i have cried her almost to the number of her hairs , i have drawn her picture with my voice .
and i prithee tell me , how dost thou find the inclination of the people , especially of the younger sort ?
, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their father testament .
there was a spaniard mouth so watered , that he went to bed to her very description .
we shall have him here with his best ruff on .
, .
but , mistress , do you know the french knight that cowers i ' the hams ?
who , monsieur veroles ?
ay , he he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation , but he made a groan at it , and swore he would see her .
well , well , as for him , he brought his disease hither here he does but repair it .
i know he will come in our shadow , to scatter his crowns in the sun .
well , if we had of every nation a traveller , we should lodge them with this sign .
to marina pray you , come hither awhile .
you have fortunes coming upon you .
mark me you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly , despise profit where you have most gain .
to weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion , and that opinion a mere profit .
i understand you not .
o , take her home , mistress , take her home these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise .
thou sayest true , i ' faith , so they must , for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant .
, some do , and some do not .
but , mistress , if i have bargained for the joint , thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit .
i may so .
who should deny it ?
come , young one , i like the manner of your garments well .
ay , by my faith , they shall not be changed yet .
boult , spend thou that in the town report what a sojourner we have , you lose nothing by custom .
when nature flamed this piece , she meant thee a good turn , therefore say what a paragon she is , and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report .
i warrant you , mistress , thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the .
i bring home some .
come your ways , follow me .
if fires be hot , knives sharp , or waters deep , untied i still my virgin knot will keep .
diana , aid my purpose !
what have we to do with diana ?
pray you , will you go with us ?
exeunt scene iii .
tarsus .
a room in cleon house .
enter cleon and dionyza why , are you foolish ?
can it be undone ?
o dionyza , such a piece of slaughter the sun and moon look upon !
i think you turn a child again .
were i chief lord of all this spacious world , give it to undo the deed .
o lady , much less in blood than virtue , yet a princess to equal any single crown o ' the earth i ' the justice of compare !
o villain leonine !
whom thou hast poison too if thou hadst drunk to him , had been a kindness becoming well thy fact what canst thou say when noble pericles shall demand his child ?
that she is dead .
nurses are not the fates , to foster it , nor ever to preserve .
she died at night , i say so .
who can cross it ?
unless you play the pious innocent , and for an honest attribute cry out died by foul play . '
o , go to .
well , well , of all the faults beneath the heavens , the gods do like this worst .
be one of those that think the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence , and open this to pericles .
i do shame to think of what a noble strain you are , and of how coward a spirit .
to such proceeding who ever but his approbation added , though not his prime consent , he did not flow from honourable sources .
be it so , then yet none does know , but you , how she came dead , nor none can know , leonine being gone .
she did disdain my child , and stood between her and her fortunes none would look on her , but cast their gazes on marina face , whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin not worth the time of day .
it pierced me through , and though you call my course unnatural , you not your child well loving , yet i find it greets me as an enterprise of kindness perform to your sole daughter .
heavens forgive it !
and as for pericles , what should he say ?
we wept after her hearse , and yet we mourn her monument is almost finish , and her epitaphs in glittering golden characters express a general praise to her , and care in us at whose expense is done .
thou art like the harpy , which , to betray , dost , with thine angel face , seize with thine eagle talons .
you are like one that superstitiously doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies but yet i know you do as i advise .
exeunt scene iv enter gower , before the monument of marina at tarsus thus time we waste , and longest leagues make short , sail seas in cockles , have an wish but , making , to take your imagination , from bourn to bourn , region to region .
by you being pardon , we commit no crime to use one language in each several clime where our scenes seem to live .
i do beseech you to learn of me , who stand i ' the gaps to teach you , the stages of our story .
pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas , attended on by many a lord and knight .
to see his daughter , all his life delight .
old escanes , whom helicanus late advanced in time to great and high estate , is left to govern .
bear you it in mind , old helicanus goes along behind .
ships and bounteous winds have brought this king to tarsus , think his pilot thought , so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on , to fetch his daughter home , who first is gone .
like motes and shadows see them move awhile , your ears unto your eyes i reconcile .
dumb show .
enter pericles , at one door , with all his train , cleon and dionyza , at the other .
cleon shows pericles the tomb , whereat pericles makes lamentation , puts on sackcloth , and in a mighty passion departs .
then exeunt cleon and dionyza see how belief may suffer by foul show !
this borrow passion stands for true old woe , and pericles , in sorrow all devour , with sighs shot through , and biggest tears , leaves tarsus and again embarks .
he swears never to wash his face , nor cut his hairs he puts on sackcloth , and to sea .
he bears a tempest , which his mortal vessel tears , and yet he rides it out .
now please you wit .
the epitaph is for marina writ by wicked dionyza .
reads the inscription on marina monument fairest , , and best lies here , who wither in her spring of year .
she was of tyrus the king daughter , on whom foul death hath made this slaughter , marina was she call , and at her birth , thetis , being proud , swallow some part o ' the earth therefore the earth , fearing to be , hath thetis ' on the heavens bestow wherefore she does , and swears she never stint , make raging battery upon shores of flint . '
no visor does become black villany so well as soft and tender flattery .
let pericles believe his daughter dead , and bear his courses to be ordered by lady fortune , while our scene must play his daughter woe and heavy in her unholy service .
patience , then , and think you now are all in mytilene .
exit scene mytilene .
a street before the brothel .
enter , from the brothel , two gentlemen did you ever hear the like ?
no , nor never shall do in such a place as this , she being once gone .
but to have divinity preached there !
did you ever dream of such a thing ?
no , no .
come , i am for no more shall go hear the vestals sing ?
i do any thing now that is virtuous , but i am out of the road of rutting for ever .

fie , fie upon her !
she able to freeze the god priapus , and undo a whole generation .
we must either get her ravished , or be rid of her .
when she should do for clients her fitment , and do me the kindness of our profession , she has me her quirks , her reasons , her master reasons , her prayers , her knees , that she would make a puritan of the devil , if he should cheapen a kiss of her .
, i must ravish her , or she disfurnish us of all our cavaliers , and make our swearers priests .
now , the pox upon her for me !
, there no way to be rid o but by the way to the pox .
here comes the lord lysimachus disguised .
we should have both lord and lown , if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers .
enter lysimachus how now !
how a dozen of virginities ?
now , the gods your honour !
i am glad to see your honour in good health .
you may so , is the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs .
how now !
wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal withal , and defy the surgeon ?
we have here one , sir , if she would but there never came her like in mytilene .
if do the deed of darkness , thou wouldst say .
your honour knows what is to say well enough .
well , call forth , call forth .
for flesh and blood , sir , white and red , you shall see a rose , and she were a rose indeed , if she had but what , prithee ?
o , sir , i can be modest .
that dignifies the renown of a bawd , no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste .
exit boult here comes that which grows to the stalk , never plucked yet , i can assure you .
boult with marina is she not a fair creature ?
, she would serve after a long voyage at sea .
well , there for you leave us .
i beseech your honour , give me leave a word , and i have done presently .
i beseech you , do .
to marina first , i would have you note , this is an honourable man .
i desire to find him so , that i may worthily note him .
next , he the governor of this country , and a man whom i am bound to .
if he govern the country , you are bound to him indeed , but how honourable he is in that , i know not .
pray you , without any more virginal fencing , will you use him kindly ?
he will line your apron with gold .
what he will do graciously , i will thankfully receive .
ha ' you done ?
my lord , she not paced yet you must take some pains to work her to your manage .
come , we will leave his honour and her together .
go thy ways .
exeunt bawd , pandar , and boult now , pretty one , how long have you been at this trade ?
what trade , sir ?
why , i can not but i shall offend .
i can not be offended with my trade .
please you to name it .
how long have you been of this profession ?
since i can remember .
did you go to so young ?
were you a gamester at five or at seven ?
earlier too , sir , if now i be one .
why , the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale .
do you know this house to be a place of such resort , and will come into ?
i hear say you are of honourable parts , and are the governor of this place .
why , hath your principal made known unto you who i am ?
who is my principal ?
why , your , she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity .
o , you have heard something of my power , and so stand aloof for more serious wooing .
but i protest to thee , pretty one , my authority shall not see thee , or else look friendly upon thee .
come , bring me to some private place come , come .
if you were born to honour , show it now , if put upon you , make the judgment good that thought you worthy of it .
how this ?
how this ?
some more , be sage .
for me , that am a maid , though most ungentle fortune have placed me in this sty , where , since i came , diseases have been sold dearer than physic , o , that the gods would set me free from this unhallow place , though they did change me to the meanest bird that flies i ' the purer air !
i did not think thou couldst have spoke so well , dream thou couldst .
had i brought hither a corrupted mind , thy speech had alter it .
hold , here gold for thee persever in that clear way thou goest , and the gods strengthen thee !
the good gods preserve you !
for me , be you thoughten that i came with no ill intent , for to me the very doors and windows savour vilely .
fare thee well .
thou art a piece of virtue , and i doubt not but thy training hath been noble .

boult i beseech your honour , one piece for me .
avaunt , thou damned !
your house , but for this virgin that doth prop it , would sink and overwhelm you .

if your peevish chastity , which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope , shall undo a whole household , let me be gelded like a spaniel .
come your ways .
whither would you have me ?
i must have your maidenhead taken off , or the common hangman shall execute it .
come your ways .
we have no more gentlemen driven away .
come your ways , i say .
bawd how now !
what the matter ?
worse and worse , mistress , she has here spoken holy words to the lord lysimachus .
o abominable !
she makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods .
marry , hang her up for ever !
the nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman , and she sent him away as cold as a snowball , saying his prayers too .
boult , take her away , use her at thy pleasure crack the glass of her virginity , and make the rest malleable .
an if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is , she shall be ploughed .

prithee , tell me one thing first .
come now , your one thing .
what canst thou wish thine enemy to be ?
why , i could wish him to be my master , or rather , my mistress .
neither of these are so bad as thou art , since they do better thee in their command .

what would you have me do ?
go to the wars , would you ?
where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg , and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one ?
do any thing but this thou doest .
empty old receptacles , or common shores , of filth , serve by indenture to the common hangman any of these ways are yet better than this , for what thou professest , a baboon , could he speak , would own a name too dear .
o , that the gods would safely deliver me from this place !
here , here gold for thee .
if that thy master would gain by thee , proclaim that i can sing , weave , sew , and dance , with other virtues , which i keep from boast and i will undertake all these to teach .

but can you teach all this you speak of ?
prove that i can not , take me home again , and prostitute me to the basest groom that doth frequent your house .
well , i will see what i can do for thee if i can place thee , i will .
but amongst honest women .
, my acquaintance lies little amongst them .
but since my master and mistress have bought you , there no going but by their consent therefore i will make them acquainted with your purpose , and i doubt not but i shall find them tractable enough .
come , i do for thee what i can , come your ways .
exeunt act v enter gower marina thus the brothel , and chances into an honest house , our story says .
she sings like one immortal , and she dances as to her admired lays , deep clerks she dumbs , and with her needle composes nature own shape , of bud , bird , branch , or berry , that even her art sisters the natural roses , her inkle , silk , twin with the rubied cherry that pupils lacks she none of noble race , who pour their bounty on her , and her gain she gives the cursed bawd .
here we her place , and to her father turn our thoughts again , where we left him , on the sea .
we there him lost , whence , driven before the winds , he is arrived here where his daughter dwells , and on this coast suppose him now at anchor .
the city strived god neptune annual feast to keep from whence lysimachus our tyrian ship espies , his banners sable , trimm with rich expense , and to him in his barge with fervor hies .
in your supposing once more put your sight of heavy pericles , think this his bark where what is done in action , more , if might , shall be discover , please you , sit and hark .
exit scene i .
on board pericles ' ship , off mytilene .
a close pavilion on deck , with a curtain before it , pericles within it , reclined on a couch .
a barge lying beside the tyrian vessel .
enter two sailors , one belonging to the tyrian vessel , the other to the barge , to them helicanus to the sailor of mytilene where is lord helicanus ?
he can resolve you .
o , here he is .
sir , there a barge put off from mytilene , and in it is lysimachus the governor , who craves to come aboard .
what is your will ?
that he have his .
call up some gentlemen .
ho , gentlemen !
my lord calls .
enter two or three gentlemen doth your lordship call ?
gentlemen , there some of worth would come aboard , i pray ye , greet them fairly .
the gentlemen and the two sailors descend , and go on board the barge enter , from thence , lysimachus and lords , with the gentlemen and the two sailors sir , this is the man that can , in aught you would , resolve you .
hail , reverend sir !
the gods preserve you !
and you , sir , to outlive the age i am , and die as i would do .
you wish me well .
being on shore , honouring of neptune triumphs , seeing this goodly vessel ride before us , i made to it , to know of whence you are .
first , what is your place ?
i am the governor of this place you lie before .
sir , our vessel is of tyre , in it the king , a man who for this three months hath not spoken to any one , nor taken sustenance but to prorogue his grief .
upon what ground is his distemperature ?
be too tedious to repeat , but the main grief springs from the loss of a beloved daughter and a wife .
may we not see him ?
you may , but bootless is your sight he will not speak to any .
yet let me obtain my wish .
behold him .
pericles discovered this was a goodly person , till the disaster that , one mortal night , drove him to this .
sir king , all hail !
the gods preserve you !
hail , royal sir !
it is in vain , he will not speak to you .
sir , we have a maid in mytilene , i durst wager , would win some words of him .
is well bethought .
she questionless with her sweet harmony and other chosen attractions , would allure , and make a battery through his deafen parts , which now are midway stopp she is all happy as the fairest of all , and , with her fellow maids is now upon the leafy shelter that abuts against the island side .
whispers a lord , who goes off in the barge of lysimachus sure , all effectless , yet nothing we omit that bears recovery name .
but , since your kindness we have stretch thus far , let us beseech you that for our gold we may provision have , wherein we are not destitute for want , but weary for the staleness .
o , sir , a courtesy which if we should deny , the most just gods for every graff would send a caterpillar , and so afflict our province .
yet once more let me entreat to know at large the cause of your king sorrow .
sit , sir , i will recount it to you but , see , i am prevented .
, from the barge , lord , with marina , and a young lady o , here is the lady that i sent for .
welcome , fair one !
not a goodly presence ?
she a gallant lady .
she such a one , that , were i well assured came of a gentle kind and noble stock , wish no better choice , and think me rarely fair one , all goodness that consists in bounty expect even here , where is a kingly patient if that thy prosperous and artificial feat can draw him but to answer thee in aught , thy sacred physic shall receive such pay as thy desires can wish .
sir , i will use my utmost skill in his recovery , provided that none but i and my companion maid be suffer to come near him .
come , let us leave her , and the gods make her prosperous !
marina sings mark he your music ?
no , nor look on us .
see , she will speak to him .
hail , sir !
my lord , lend ear .
hum , ha !
i am a maid , my lord , that before invited eyes , but have been gazed on like a comet she speaks , my lord , that , may be , hath endured a grief might equal yours , if both were justly weigh .
though wayward fortune did malign my state , my derivation was from ancestors who stood equivalent with mighty kings but time hath rooted out my parentage , and to the world and awkward casualties bound me in servitude .
aside i will desist , but there is something glows upon my cheek , and whispers in mine ear , not till he speak . '
my fortunes parentage good parentage to equal mine ! was it not thus ?
what say you ?
i said , my lord , if you did know my parentage , you would not do me violence .
i do think so .
pray you , turn your eyes upon me .
you are like something that what ?
here of these shores ?
no , nor of any shores yet i was mortally brought forth , and am no other than i appear .
i am great with woe , and shall deliver weeping .
my dearest wife was like this maid , and such a one my daughter might have been my queen square brows , her stature to an inch , as straight , as , her eyes as and cased as richly , in pace another juno , who starves the ears she feeds , and makes them hungry , the more she gives them speech .
where do you live ?
where i am but a stranger from the deck you may discern the place .
where were you bred ?
and how achieved you these endowments , which you make more rich to owe ?
if i should tell my history , it would seem like lies disdain in the reporting .
prithee , speak falseness can not come from thee , for thou modest as justice , and thou a palace for the crown truth to dwell in i will believe thee , and make my senses credit thy relation to points that seem impossible , for thou like one i loved indeed .
what were thy friends ?
didst thou not say , when i did push thee back which was when i perceived thee that thou camest from good descending ?
so indeed i did .
report thy parentage .
i think thou thou hadst been toss from wrong to injury , and that thou thy griefs might equal mine , if both were open .
some such thing i said , and said no more but what my thoughts did warrant me was likely .
tell thy story , if thine consider prove the thousandth part of my endurance , thou art a man , and i have suffer like a girl yet thou dost look like patience gazing on kings ' graves , and smiling extremity out of act .
what were thy friends ?
how lost thou them ?
thy name , my most kind virgin ?
recount , i do beseech thee come , sit by me .
my name is marina .
o , i am mock , and thou by some incensed god sent hither to make the world to laugh at me .

nay , i be patient .
thou little how thou dost startle me , to call thyself marina .
the name was given me by one that had some power , my father , and a king .
how !
a king daughter ?
and call marina ?
you said you would believe me , but , not to be a troubler of your peace , i will end here .
but are you flesh and blood ?
have you a working pulse ?
and are no fairy ?
motion !
well , speak on .
where were you born ?
and wherefore call marina ?
call marina for i was born at sea .
at sea !
what mother ?
my mother was the daughter of a king , who died the minute i was born , as my good nurse lychorida hath oft deliver weeping .
o , stop there a little !
aside this is the rarest dream that dull sleep did mock sad fools withal this can not be my daughter buried .
well where were you bred ?
i hear you more , to the bottom of your story , and never interrupt you .
you scorn believe me , best i did give .
i will believe you by the syllable of what you shall deliver .
yet , give me leave how came you in these parts ?
where were you bred ?
the king my father did in tarsus leave me , till cruel cleon , with his wicked wife , did seek to murder me and having woo a villain to attempt it , who having drawn to , a crew of pirates came and rescued me , brought me to mytilene .
but , good sir , whither will you have me ?
why do you weep ?
it may be , you think me an impostor no , good faith , i am the daughter to king pericles , if good king pericles be .
ho , helicanus !
calls my lord ?
thou art a grave and noble counsellor , most wise in general tell me , if thou canst , what this maid is , or what is like to be , that thus hath made me weep ?
i know not , but here is the regent , sir , of mytilene speaks nobly of her .
she would never tell her parentage , being demanded that , she would sit still and weep .
o helicanus , strike me , honour sir , give me a gash , put me to present pain , lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me the shores of my mortality , and drown me with their sweetness .
o , come hither , thou that him that did thee beget , thou that wast born at sea , buried at tarsus , and found at sea again !
o helicanus , down on thy knees , thank the holy gods as loud as thunder threatens us this is marina .
what was thy mother name ?
tell me but that , for truth can never be confirm enough , though doubts did ever sleep .
first , sir , i pray , what is your title ?
i am pericles of tyre but tell me now my drown queen name , as in the rest you said thou hast been godlike perfect , the heir of kingdoms and another like to pericles thy father .
is it no more to be your daughter than to say my mother name was thaisa ?
thaisa was my mother , who did end the minute i began .
now , blessing on thee !
rise , thou art my child .
give me fresh garments .
mine own , helicanus , she is not dead at tarsus , as she should have been , by savage cleon she shall tell thee all , when thou shalt kneel , and justify in knowledge she is thy very princess .
who is this ?
sir , is the governor of mytilene , who , hearing of your melancholy state , did come to see you .
i embrace you .
give me my robes .
i am wild in my beholding .
o heavens bless my girl !
but , hark , what music ?
tell helicanus , my marina , tell him , point by point , for yet he seems to doubt , how sure you are my daughter .
but , what music ?
my lord , i hear none .
none !
the music of the spheres !
list , my marina .
it is not good to cross him , give him way .
rarest sounds !
do ye not hear ?
my lord , i hear .
music most heavenly music !
it nips me unto listening , and thick slumber hangs upon mine eyes let me rest .
sleeps a pillow for his head so , leave him all .
well , my companion friends , if this but answer to my just belief , i well remember you .
